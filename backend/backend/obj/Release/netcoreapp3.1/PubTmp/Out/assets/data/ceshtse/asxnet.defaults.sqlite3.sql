 (8,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beaches</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">All the beaches in Acapulco are open to the public, including those near the most exclusive hotel resorts. The following beaches are particularly worth visiting: Barra Vieja, enormous in length Laguna de Tres Palos, which eventually leads to the Pacific; the Beaches of Caleta and Caletilla in old Acapulco and a favorite among the locals; Magic Marine World, Roqueta Island, La Angosta, Playa Condesa and the Laguna de Coyuca; La Isla Roqueta is perfect for snorkeling or windsurfing. While still on the subject of beaches, it\''s necessary to mention the Beaches of Hornos and Hornitos: a swimmer\''s paradise; and Icacos Beach, one of the finest places in Acapulco. Playa Pie de la Cuesta is the ideal place to sit and watch the sunset; what you see on the postcards is nothing compared to the magical experience of seeing it live. Surfers find its waters a true paradise. The waves of Port Marqués Bay are not particularly swimmer-friendly, but many people prefer them for water sports. At El Revolcadero you have the chance to ride a horse along the shore and check out stunning views. Other beaches which are well worth visiting include Tamarindos Beach and Tlacopanocha.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sailing</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sailing in a yacht is one of the favorite activities among tourists who visit the Bay. Although the sea is not entirely calm and one requires some previous experience or simply natural talent to sail, fishing certainly poses no danger. Why not take your fishing-rod? You could catch anything from barracudas to sharks. There are special fishing tours you can book; the men in charge of the boats know where to find what you are after, and with their advice and suggestions, your experience is bound to be a success.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Golf</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Acapulco is also excellent for playing golf, with two very good golf courses, one of which is at the Hotel Princess Mundo Imperial, and the other at Club de Golf de Acapulco, both with 18 holes. There are also several hotels that have tennis courts such as the Hyatt Hotel.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Historical Sights</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you fancy a walk, visit some of the many arts and crafts shops, where a great amount of establishments specialize in Taxco silver and traditional arts and crafts from the Guerrero province. On Sundays, enjoy the folk music and try something special to eat at the Acapulco Garden Club. La Catedral is a chance to look into the history of Acapulco and the Acapulco International Convention Center is famous for the amount of quality shows that run year after year here, particularly concerts from the Acapulco Symphony Orchestra and music festivals. The Acapulco Festival is the world\''s largest since 1991 and stays current every time with large surprises.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Scenic Walks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">During your visit, don\''t forget to go for a walk along La Quebrada, where, for decades, divers have tried their luck and put their lives at risk by diving from a great height to a narrow and dangerous entry into the Pacific Ocean, from a mountain peak. Yet another of the old attractions of Acapulco. The landscape from up here is beautiful and there is a wide selection of arts and crafts shops and traditional restaurants.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Family Fun</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Acapulco offers entertainment for everyone, whatever age, tastes or interests. For the little ones, stop at the CICI, with famous slides and water games, as well as all sorts of trained sea animals.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With a dynamic nightlife scene, Acapulco\''s bars and clubs come alive after sunset. From chic cocktail lounges to all-out dance parties, there is something for everyone here. For Latin rhythms and dancing, head to Mojito while Baby\''O is a three-decade cult favorite that dances till dawn in a neon frenzy. For a more sophisticated night out, Siboney Piano Bar is a top pick.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (9,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Zona Tradicional</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the main attractions has remained unchanged through time - traditional Acapulco continues to be an ideal place to stroll. You can visit the San Diego Fort, which served as protection against the attacks of dangerous buccaneers in times when pirates were a common threat; Roqueta Island, with known for its snorkeling and diving spots; El Zócalo, with its well-known, curiously designed Cathedral; La Quebrada, and its daring divers; or the Beaches of Caleta and Caletilla, popular with Acapulco locals. The activities in this district tend to be fun and cheap.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Zona Dorada</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Zona Dorada (\"Golden Area\"), one of the largest districts in Acapulco, extends itself throughout the Avenida Miguel Alemán, also called Costera. In this area, compared by some to Sunset Boulevard, there is a large number of exclusive shops, restaurants and bars, and also some four-star hotels. The Centro Internacional de Convenciones Acapulco is found here. Those looking for sun and sand will find it at one of the two busiest beaches, Playa Condesa and Playa Icacos located within the Zona Dorada. The soft golden sand, crystal clear waters, and plenty of opportunities for recreation along this stretch make it very popular.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pie de la Cuesta</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><div> If you\''re taking the panoramic road towards la Quebrada, you will find a district called Pie de la Cuesta, a small fishing village famous for offering some of the most glorious sunsets you are ever likely to see. People travel from all over Acapulco just to catch a glimpse of this wonderful display. The sea is open, so the large waves make it dangerous to swim in. However, you can just sit and watch the sun setting with friends, or taste a dish or two at nearby restaurants like Tres Marías. Nature enthusiasts will enjoy a visit to Laguna de Coyuca, a natural lagoon known for its wildlife and bird population.</div></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bahía Puerto Marqués</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Port Marqués Bay is the other district that nature seems to have blessed: natural charm and postcard scenery abound. In this area, tourism has taken over with large hotels, shops and eateries. One of its greatest attractions is its seafood market, which can be found along the beach. For watersports enthusiasts, there are plenty of opportunities for sailing and water skiing, thanks to the water\''s relative calm.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Punta Diamante</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the most exclusive spots, with private beaches and large luxury hotels is Punta Diamante. One such hotel is the Hotel Las Brisas complex, with hotels and condominiums. These places occupy the beaches of Pichilingue, far from the town and the Costera Miguel Alemán. This means the hotels have all sorts of services and facilities, and often host events like congresses and symposia. The two main beaches, Playas Puerto Marqués and Revolcadero are thronged with sunbathers and water sports enthusiasts. This neighborhood, stretching from the Acapulco Bay to the International Airport is one of the most upscale neighborhoods of the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outside Acapulco</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Towards the international airport is an area with hotel complexes and all-inclusive resorts. These include Hotel Princess Mundo Imperial, Hotel Mayan Palace and Tres Vidas, with its world-class golf course, located near the Laguna de Tres Palos. The sea here is open, which makes it ideal for practicing sports such as surfing. However, it is not ideal for swimming. Throughout the beach, one can find many places selling typical local dishes, which you will be hard pressed to find elsewhere. This is the case of the delicious <em>Pescado a la talla</em> dish, well-seasoned freshly caught fish.  It may be the old Acapulco which enchanted Elizabeth Taylor, or the new one. With its large hotel chains, luxury shops, theme restaurants or popular clubs, tourism is still going strong in the bay, as strong as it has ever been. If you visit Acapulco, be sure to try a bit of both worlds; you\''re likely to come back time and time again.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Below him rolls an expanse of attractive green parkland, resplendent with rose beds, peppered with trees and dominated by the ivy-clad Adelaide Oval. To the rear of the cricket ground lies lazy Torrens Lake, its southern foreshore replete with grand bluestone buildings that contrast starkly with white concrete extrusions of the Festival Centre. Further south, modest towers mark the heart of Adelaide\''s central business district, while to the east a corrugated line of hills defines its inland boundary. To the west, the coastal plain slips gently away into the rich blue waters of St Vincent\''s Gulf.  So it is easy to see why there should be a flicker of pride on Colonel Light\''s weathered face. It is also wholly appropriate that the City of Light should become the city of churches - mighty St Peter\''s Cathedral lays testament to that. However, as all Adelaidians know, there is much more to their captivating city than things ecclesiastical. In modern day Adelaide, festivals, food and fine wine are just for starters.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Jazz, bluegrass, folk, blues or rock—they are all at \"The Gov.\" Fowler\''s Live also hosts concerts by well-known artists. Looking for something a bit more classical? The Adelaide Festival Centre features symphony concerts, opera and popular musicals. If you are keen on chamber music, try the Elder Conservatorium at Adelaide University—they often hold concerts in Elder Hall. For rock spectaculars and grand classic concerts check out Adelaide Entertainment Centre. The Botanic Park provides a beautiful backdrop for big name concerts and events.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater & Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A fine reputation for the arts means Adelaide has lots to offer the casual visitor. The Festival Theatre is Adelaide\''s showcase for musicals, with many of the productions being formulated in Adelaide before touring the other Australian states. The State Theatre Company presents classic and modern theater throughout the year at various venues throughout the area, including the Festival Centre\''s theaters and the Odeon Theatre and smaller repertory groups are active throughout the city and suburbs.  Adelaideans love the movies, so cinemas are everywhere, from the huge Event Cinemas Marion with multiple screens to the suburban single screen favorites like the art-deco Windsor Theatres. Arthouse cinemas include the city center Palace Nova EastEnd Cinemas and Trak Cinemas. Mercury Cinema often hosts exclusive film festivals.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports lovers are well catered for with the Adelaide Oval (home of the national cricket team), Memorial Drive for tennis buffs and the State Hockey Centre, home to the SA Suns and the Southern Hotshots. Australian Rules Football can be seen at the Alberton Oval. Coopers Stadium is home to the Adelaide United soccer team.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Adelaide is home to some of the best museums in South Australia. The South Australian Museum contains the largest collection of Aboriginal artifacts in the entire world, as well as abundant natural history galleries on all kinds of topics. To view spectacular works of fine art, visit the Art Gallery of South Australia and its collection of over 35,000 paintings, sculptures and photographs. The Migration Museum displays the history of the settlement of Australia and immigration up until the present. To learn more about the nautical history of South Australia, head to Port Adelaide\''s South Australian Maritime Museum.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (19,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The City Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Adelaide\''s central business district still measures exactly one square mile. And it is packed with goodies, all within easy walking distance of each other. This is especially true along North Terrace, where there is ready access to the Adelaide Casino plus the imposing granite and marble Parliament House building. Moving east, grandiose buildings queue for attention the State Library, South Australian Museum, Art Gallery of South Australia and Ayers House (the mansion of Sir Henry Ayers, an early state premier who later had a very large rock named in his honor.) Further along North Terrace, the weary wanderer can relax amidst the blooms and flowering shrubs of Adelaide Botanic Garden.  Shoppers flock to the ever-festive Rundle Mall, historically the first traffic-free shopping mall in Australia. Many of the big retail players can be found here, as can a variety of street entertainers. The Mall leads eastwards onto Rundle Street, which throbs with a cultural mix of diners and thirsty pub-goers. It is also the primary venue of Adelaide\''s Fringe Festival. Across the eastern parklands from Rundle Street lies the fashionable inner city suburb of Norwood with its ever-popular dining precinct, The Parade.  Shoppers in search of bargains, or simply fresh herbs and vegetables, head for the Central Market and Chinatown. Neighboring Gouger Street is alive with yummy restaurants; Asian, of course, plus a wealth of other cuisines. In the heart of the city stands the symbolic fountain of Victoria Square. A handy landmark for several hotels, the square also provides a terminus for Adelaide\''s only tram, which trundles its way to the beachfront at Glenelg.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Adelaide</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Both the city and elegant North Adelaide are isolated from the surrounding suburbs by a leafy moat of parklands. A jewel in Adelaide\''s crown, this \"figure-of-eight\" greenery enhances a unique and enviable lifestyle for city-dwellers. It is small wonder, therefore, that some of the state\''s grandest homes grace the streets of North Adelaide. Along O\''Connell Street lies the lure of many fine restaurants, with pavement dining under lacy iron verandas a specialty.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Port Adelaide</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The generously wide streets, sturdy stone buildings, and uncompromising wharf side warehouses tell tales of a proud and historic past for Adelaide\''s ocean port. The plethora of street-corner pubs also suggest that this history has been amply laced with rum and brandy! Port Adelaide lies less than half an hour\''s drive north west of the city and today it remains a modest working port. Tourism through Port River cruises, Sunday markets, twee cafés and informative museums such as the excellent Maritime Museum fuel the local economy. The region as a whole is a fascinating mix of heavy industry, recreation and residential boom, exemplified by the award-winning West Lakes residential development.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Coastal Fringe</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spanning nearly 70 kilometers (43.5 miles) north to south, the Adelaide coastal fringe runs from North Haven marina to the sumptuous white sands of Sellicks Beach. Whether viewing or doing, there is beachside fun a plenty. Not to mention sunsets to die for! Explore Adelaide\''s maritime heritage around Semaphore, follow discerning diners to Henley Beach or enjoy the hive of activity and history at Glenelg.  When there is a swell in the Gulf, knowing surfers head for the mid-south coast, while windsurfers test their skills off Seacliff Beach, or just grab a towel and head for Maslin Beach!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Adelaide Hills</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rising around the eastern rim of the coastal plain, the Adelaide Hills offer a favorite fresh air treat. Delightful forests of stringybark gums carpet many slopes, while in Belair National Park and conservation parks, such as Scott Creek and Cleland Wildlife Park, native flora and fauna abound. So watch out for kangaroos, koalas and bandicoots! Farming and market gardening are important industries with vineyards blossoming on many hillsides. Tourism has also taken off, with enchanting villages such as Stirling and the \"little Germany\" that is Hahndorf, dotted throughout the hills. Of course, no visit to the hills would be complete without experiencing that breathtaking view over Adelaide night and day from the summit of Mount Lofty.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Wine Districts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Adelaide is unquestionably the wine capital of Australia, simply because it lies within an hour\''s drive of some of the finest vineyards in the southern hemisphere. To the north, you will find the world-renowned Barossa Valley with its proud Teutonic heritage, rich soils and exquisite flavors. Equally appealing to many wine-lovers is the quality of product from the south of the city, the boutique wineries of McLaren Vale. Indeed, what better way to spend a lazy afternoon than drinking fine wine amidst gentle hills, fertile flats and tinkling creeks?</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Palace is also home to the Albany Symphony Orchestra which calls two other venues of the area home: the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall in Troy and the Canfield Casino in Saratoga Springs. The Capital Repertory Theatre also on North Pearl Street has independent and off-Broadway shows their intimate venue. The Egg over at Empire State Plaza (thus named for its egg shape) hosts a variety of music, dance and family performances at this unique theater. On Hudson Avenue is the eba Dance Theater, a dance school with a professional touring company that is a popular community dance and theater space.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Comedy</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If comedy is more your thing, The Comedy Works on State Street hosts comedy shows and comedians from around the country in a small club close to the New York Capital. At the Crossgates Mall, the comedians at the  Albany Funny Bone will have you clutching your sides with laughter.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are several modern movie theaters in Albany, the majority of them located outside the Downtown area. The Regal Colonie Center Stadium 13 and Regal Crossgates Stadium 18 have stadium seating, trendy concessions and are located in two of the region\''s best-loved malls. If you like watching re-runs of Hollywood\''s classics and other family favorites, The Palace has screenings of films like <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, <em>Citizen Kane</em> and <em>Casablanca</em>.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Times Union Center in the heart of Downtown is the largest venue for big sporting events, like MAAC Basketball Championship games, ECAC Hockey Championships, Siena College\''s Saints basketball team, and the AHL\''s Albany River Rats. The Washington Avenue Armory is home to many cultural and sporting events, and it is home to the Albany Patroons, a Continental Basketball Association (CBA) American Division team. Albany is also home to the New York Giants\'' summer training camp, so chances are you can see some of the season\''s biggest names for low prices while they are in town.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are plenty of open green spaces in Albany. The multi-million dollar project of revitalizing the Hudson River Way and Riverfront Park has created one of the loveliest walkways around, especially with the comfortable amphitheater that overlooks the water. To the west of Empire State Plaza along Delaware Avenue is Lincoln Park, an enjoyable place in the summer with its large outdoor pool or in the winter with its cross-country skiing and snowshoe trails. In Washington Park, there are many places to walk around, bike or have a picnic. During the summer months, enjoy a show at the Park Playhouse.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Over on Lark Street and Downtown towards the River are a majority of the city\''s popular nighttime hangouts. Café Hollywood has retro jukebox where you can pick your favorite tunes and the Lark Tavern is a great place to catch live music, hang out with friends or try a microbrew.

 (37,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Capitol Hill</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This area is home to the ultra-modern public space of the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza (usually shortened to simply Empire State Plaza), the New York State Capitol Building, and the Alfred E. Smith Building. The central part of the city known as Midtown is booming with over 12,000 government employees who fill this 96-acre (39-hectare) area on weekdays, and with visitors galore at nighttime during performances at The Egg.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The area around Broadway by the Hudson is the site of the first Dutch settlement in Albany. Unfortunately, none of the 17th-century buildings remain. However, there are other historical buildings in the area, including the 1915 Delaware and Hudson, or D&H Buildings, which were originally constructed to hide the factories and incoming ships into the port of Albany. Today, the D&H Building is headquarters of the State University of New York (SUNY) College system. The Hudson River Way and Riverfront Park have been part of an enormous revitalization project by introducing tree-lined walking and cycling paths as well as an 800-seat amphitheater that overlooks the Hudson. One reason most people come to this part of the city is to attend sporting events, concerts and conventions at the Times Union Center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lark Street: Center Square & Hudson/Park</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Situated right behind Empire State Plaza are the two neighborhoods of Center Square and Hudson/Park. Intersecting the two is the popular Lark Street Business Improvement District. This unique seven-block strip from Washington Avenue to Delaware Avenue has everything you need, day or night. During the day, there are small bookstores, interesting knickknack shops, restaurants, eclectic bars and minimal chain outlets (just Ben & Jerry\''s and Dunkin\'' Donuts). Lark Street is also home to LarkFEST in September and Capital Pride in the month of June. These two districts are full of beautifully maintained, mid-19th-century townhouses.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mansion</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This small, scenic area borders Capitol Hill and is named for the New York State Executive Mansion that is located here at Eagle Street. You will not find many places to eat, shops or anything of that nature in this area, but it\''s a popular residential area with lovely homes that are easily accessible from Empire State Plaza.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pastures</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Another residential area that goes down to the Hudson is the historic district of Pastures with its Federal-style houses, which has been on the National Register of Historical Places since 1972. During the 17th Century, the area was just that - pastures. Although the neighborhood fell into disrepair for many years with derelict houses and unkempt public grounds, Pastures is currently experiencing urban revitalization thanks to the nearby Albany Housing Authority and the introduction of tennis courts, a children\''s playground and efforts to tidy up the buildings and sidewalks.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Arbor Hill</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This neighborhood is located in the hilly northern part of Albany and is where you can easily find gorgeous 19th-century homes that have been restored to their former glory. The Palace Theatre, a former RKO movie house on the corner of North Pearl and Clinton Avenues, which opened in 1931 and closed in 1969. Thanks to new owners interested in its preservation, The Palace underwent an enormous restoration project and has reopened as the home of the Albany Symphony Orchestra. The Palace also hosts numerous music events and screenings of classic films.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ten Broeck Triangle</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">So named for the small triangle of streets that surround the Ten Broeck Mansion, the Ten Broeck Triangle Historic District is a residential section filled with pre-Civil War townhouses. The Mansion on the hillside was built in 1798 and is home to the Albany County Historical Association.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cherry Hill & Krank Park</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the far end of Albany, there are two other historic residences, Cherry Hill (1787) and the Schuyler Mansion (1762). The Georgian-style Cherry Hill was occupied until 1963 when its owner Catherine Rankin passed away. The home was also where an infamous love triangle murder took place in 1827, which resulted in a closely-followed and well-publicized trial. Home to Revolutionary War hero Philip Schuyler and his wife Catherine Van Rensselaer, the Schuyler Mansion is a great example of Georgian brick design and one of the best mansions to visit in the area. Tours of both historic houses are available.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Pit is home to the UNM Lobo basketball team and is famous for its noise, energy level and pandemonium. There is no way to avoid getting immersed in the game when The Pit gets wound up. Both the Lobo men and women play in this arena and more often than not, it is before standing-room-only crowds of nearly 20,000. The Lady Lobos has held the NCAA record for the highest single-game attendance. Up from the University, just off Central Avenue, is the busiest coliseum in the state. Tingley Coliseum is host to many events year round. Every year, the first three weeks of September welcome the New Mexico State Fair.

At other times during the year, Tingly hosts the New Mexico Scorpions hockey team, the Indian National Finals Rodeo, the Gathering of Nations, concerts, monster truck rallies and dirt bike races. Without a doubt, the most famous spectator event in town is the annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. More than 1,000 colorful hot air balloons fill the skies above the city during the first two weeks of October. Balloonists maneuver to win events like the key grab, during which a set of new car keys is hung from a tall pole. The first pilot able to maneuver close enough to grab the keys gets to keep the car. Spectators are treated to musical entertainment and wonderful food provided by vendors as well as a chance to see one the world\''s most colorful spectacles.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There is no limit to what one can see at the museums in the area.

Popejoy Hall, on the University of New Mexico campus, hosts a variety of touring musical programs throughout the year including the Stomp percussion group. Now in its 23rd year, the New Mexico Jazz Workshop sponsors dozens of concerts and several major events during the year. When the stars come out, Albuquerque goes to the Isleta Amphitheater, an outdoor venue that seats 15,000. Although small, the Adobe Theater is an intimate local favorite for musical plays. The hands-down favorite venue for the performing arts is the KiMo Theater, a restored picture palace built in Pueblo Deco style when movie palaces like Grumman\''s Chinese Theater were the rage.  Where there is music, there is dance. Popejoy Hall\''s Ovation series often sponsors international dance troops like Ballet de l\''Opera de Bordeaux. The Indian Pueblo Cultural Center has Native American dancing daily and during the summer, folk dance performances can be seen at the Civic Plaza as part of Summerfest.  Theater abounds in Albuquerque, from professional traveling groups to experimental community theaters.

A drive past the opulent mansions that perch on the boulder-strewn foothills of the mountains will take you to the hikers\'' Mecca of Albuquerque. Elena Gallegos Park offers miles of trails through the sage and juniper hills. On the north end of the mountains, La Luz Trail winds to the soaring heights of Sandia Crest, where hang gliders ride the warm air currents that rise from the valley floor.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">West Mesa</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Neighborhood growth is steered by the basalt escarpment of Petroglyph National Monument in West Mesa. A hike down the trails of this unique treasure offers visitors a glimpse into New Mexico\''s prehistoric past. Shopping abounds at the new Cottonwood Mall, the state\''s second largest indoor mall. A drive down Coors Boulevard after dark offers a remarkable vista. The city becomes a sea of light that stretches from the distant mountains to the cottonwood Bosque of the Rio Grande.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Valley/South Valley</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Rio Grande Valley offers the visitor a glimpse of what the Spanish explorers saw in the 15th Century when they rode north along the Rio Grande del Norte. The economic diversity of the city unravels as you follow Rio Grande Boulevard from north to south. Some of the homes in the South Valley have withstood the test of time for hundreds of years. Nestled among these ancient dwellings are the Albuquerque Country Club. A great addition to the South Valley is the ABQ BioPark Botanic Garden where you can immerse yourself in the beauty of nature.The North Valley is home to some of the city\''s more prominent families. The world-famous racing family, the Unsers, have an estate here. Set in the adobe walls that surround the estate are wheels from cars that actually ran at the Indianapolis 500. Giant, ancient cottonwoods shade bridle paths and walking trails. A nice way to end the day is a visit to the Anderson Vineyards, where you can taste one of New Mexico\''s premier wines.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">East Mountains</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Surrounded by majestic Ponderosa Pines and expansive vistas, this area is growing faster than some people like. Populated with a mix of income brackets, age groups, and ethnic backgrounds, the east mountain area is seen as a retreat from the hustle and bustle of the big city. You can ski Sandia Peak Ski Area in the morning and golf at Paa-Ko Ridge Golf Club in the afternoon. Lodging in the East Mountains is limited to bed and breakfasts.

Amsterdam has some of the finest art museums in Europe, ranging from conventional to eccentric. No matter your interests, there\''s bound to be something to grab your attention at one of the city\''s museums. The majority of museums are placed within a short range of one another, allowing travelers to easily walk from one to the next.Many of Rembrandt, Vermeer and Frans Hals\'' finest works are part of the national heritage and housed in the Rijksmuseum. Take your time in this beautiful museum, as it sports a massive collection of permanent exhibitions and temporary shows that demand more than just an hour. Rembrandt\''s paintings are also found in abundance in Rembrandthuis. The life and works of Van Gogh can be found in the sprawling Van Gogh Museum. For modern art, tour the exhibitions in the Stedelijk Museum. It may also be worth your while to explore the many private galleries around Amsterdam, especially those that have been a longstanding fixture in the city\''s arts scene. These include the centrally located Annet Gelink Galler, the Galerie Fons Welters, the Upstream Gallery, and the Reflex Modern Art Gallery located across from the Rijksmuseum.  If you\''re interested in science and interactive entertainment, don\''t miss Science Center NEMO, designed specifically for children with numerous hands-on exhibits and technological wonders. The Scheepvaartmuseum is perfect for travelers interested in the country\''s significant maritime and nautical history. Nature lovers should visit the Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam, which contains over six thousand different kinds of plants.In a city with a past as lengthy as Amsterdam, historical museums are found in abundance. One of the best is Amsterdamse Historisch Museum, where you will learn about the city\''s developments from the 13th Century to the present day. The world-famous Anne Frank House is one of the city\''s most noteworthy attractions, recently expanded to accommodate the attraction\''s increasing popularity among visitors.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Amsterdam\''s cinema repertoire has grown a great deal in the past few years, and the city offers a diverse selection of both Hollywood blockbusters and European releases. Movie options are divided into two main categories: popular cinemas (with high-profile international films) and <em>filmhuizen</em> (art houses), where art films, documentaries and retrospectives are shown. The Movies, with its extravagant interior, is a great place to visit for regional selections and lesser-known art films, as is the Cinecenter, another indie film spot in the city. The FilmHallen, tucked away in Haarlemmerdijk, shows a bevy of restored classical films, alongside several unreleased and rare movies. The EYE Film Institute boasts of a similar agenda, with a mix of both Dutch and foreign films thrown in. A few other cinema houses include the historic Rialto and De Balie.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater & Dance</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Amsterdam hosts many theatrical events, with more productions in English than in Dutch. The De Parade is a prelude to the theater season, beginning at the end of summer and showcasing several days of performing arts, food and drink. One of the most important theater venues is the Koninklijk Theater Carré. The building was once home to a circus, but now houses a beautiful theater by the Amstel Canal with a wide variety of contemporary national and international productions. Amsterdam\''s dance culture is just as lively as its theater community. Amsterdam\''s main theater for viewing dance performances is Het Nationale Ballet. Aside from these established companies, there are several independent and amateur organizations that put on shows intermittently throughout the city\''s performing arts spaces.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Amsterdam has a lively music scene, with scores of festivals, events, and numerous concerts in the city\''s various venues. Offering brilliant acoustics for soloists and orchestras, the Royal Concertgebouw Hall has a regular program of classical performances. Beurs van Berlage also hosts a large amount of classical concerts on a regular basis. If you\''re interested opera, head to the Het Muziektheater (Stopera) on Waterlooplein, where the Netherlands Opera company puts on several shows each season.Local groups and jam sessions can often be heard throughout the city during the night. For jazz legends in intimate confines, Casablanca and Bimhuis Jazz & Improvisation are surefire options.International stars usually play in larger venues like Paradiso and Melkweg. Besides this there are a lot of concerts held throughout the year at Westergasfabriek, a former gas factory that is now a cultural space. The Amsterdam Pop Prijs, a music competition for emerging bands and artists, is held at Melkweg.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightclubs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Air Amsterdam and Paradiso on Saturday evenings are hip dance nights where locals come to shake their stuff. Techno, house and hip-hop music are some of the more popular specialties for DJs in the area. Melkweg has dance evenings that skew more toward hard house and drum & bass. The crowd is diverse but mainly young, and the atmosphere is relaxed. Other clubs like Club Prime and Escape are open until the wee hours of the morning. Jimmy Woo, a themed nightclub is spread over two stories, and has a dazzling dance floor, not to mention a strict door policy. John Doe, another favorite in the city is famous for its fabulous after-parties and works the party circuit in Rembrandtplein.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Gardens & Parks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Amsterdam has several lush gardens and parks that play host to the city\''s population in warmer months. Vondelpark is arguably the most famous park among tourists and <em>Amsterdammers</em>. The nearby Dutch Film Museum has a beautiful terrace where you can spend a whole afternoon sitting, relaxing and watching locals go about their day. The Amstel Park is located a bit away from the city center, but is a lovely retreat containing rose gardens and a glasshouse. The Amsterdamse Bos is a busier breed of parks where you can enjoy some sporty activities like cycling or running. Several of Amsterdam\''s private gardens can be accessed with prior arrangement, whether through the city\''s tourism office or a private tour operator.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Amsterdam is well known for its passion for soccer, though other sports such as hockey, skating and cycling are just a few of the area\''s popular recreational activities. The city has many cycling lanes, and though traffic still presents a threat, drivers are much more accustomed to bikes on the road. The parks are excellent for outdoor sports during warmer months, but sports centers offering gyms, saunas, swimming and bowling are wonderful wintertime options.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (66,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dam Square</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The real core of Amsterdam is Dam Square, with its beautiful Royal Palace. Most visitors arrive by train, which takes passengers from Centraal Station along the Damrak right past this busy tourist area. All kinds of souvenir shops, street performers and restaurants, not to mention hungry pigeons, populate the area. The square is used for events and concerts. Amsterdam\''s two main shopping streets, Kalverstraat and Nieuwendijk, are located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Leidseplein & Rembrandtplein</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Leidseplein and Rembrandtplein are very crowded day and night. When the sun is shining, the terraces quickly become filled with tourists. Street performers entertain the public with acrobatic acts and music. At night, the crowd changes as Amsterdammers venture out to celebrate and visit the theaters, cinemas and clubs. Many of the bars and clubs in the area, such as Escape, are open until the early morning.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Jordaan</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Built in 1612 during the expansion of the city, the Jordaan neighborhood is well known all over the country for its unique street life, while Jordanezen (the native inhabitants) are renowned for their corny songs, sarcastic humor and working-class mentality. However, most of the Jordanezen left some years ago for improved housing in neighboring cities like Almere and Purmerend. Nowadays, it is a district with many students, artists and young urban professionals, though the area does still retain a unique street culture. The Jordaan accommodates several art galleries, bars and cozy restaurants, and is akin to a small village in a big city. The area is located between Brouwersgracht, Prinsengracht, Raamstraat and Marnixstraat.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Red-Light District (De Wallen)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Amsterdam\''s Red-Light District begins left of the Damrak where medieval Amsterdam used to be. The district inhabits the streets and canals between Niezel and Sint Jansstraat to the north and south, and Nieuwmarkt and Warmoestraat to the the east and west. De Wallen is best known for its window prostitution, sex shops and live shows, concentrated around the Oude Kerk, in alleys and around the canals. The atmosphere is somewhat chaotic most of the time, but also bewildering. You\''ll find numerous places to eat, drink and have a good time.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Canals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On February 1, 1999, the Dutch government made Amsterdam\''s canal district a national monument. In 2010, UNESCO named it a World Heritage Site. The concentric rings of canals (ranging from the Singel Canal up to the Prinsengracht Canal) are a historically important part of the region, and are one of the city\''s most attractive sights. The network of canals starts at River Amstel and ends at Brouwersgracht. One third of the houses along the canals (grachtenhuizen) were built before 1850. During the 17th Century, the city extended its boundaries, and the canals were dug around the oldest part of Amsterdam to accommodate wealthy tradesmen and <em>burghers</em>. The Singel Canal was dug out first, followed by the Herengracht, Keizersgracht and, last of all, Prinsengracht.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">De Pijp</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">De Pijp was Amsterdam\''s first modern housing development, and was built at the end of the 19th Century to accommodate the city\''s growing number of laborers. Nowadays, De Pijp is known as the perfect example of a multicultural neighborhood. People from all over the world live here: young and old, students and artists. The main streets in De Pijp are Albert Cuypstraat, famous for its market, and Ferdinand Bolstraat. Around these roads you\''ll find many diverse restaurants. A typical Amsterdam <em>bruin huis</em> (pub) is located at just about every corner.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museum Quarter</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Museum Quarter is the area around the Museumplein, just a ten minute-walk from Leidseplein. The Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum and Stedelijk Museum are all located here. The Concert Building can be found in this neighborhood, as well. The Museum Quarter is also known for its exclusive shops. Many international clothing brands have boutiques on P.C. Hooftstraat and Van Baerlestraat. Of course, the Museumplein is a great place to sit in the sun, enjoy your lunch or just relax. This cultural area is very crowded during the day, but usually deserted at night.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Banks of the River Ij</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most modern city developments are located on the southern banks of the River Ij, on both the west and east sides of Centraal Station. This desolate area used to be occupied by dilapidated warehouses, but was completely redeveloped, allowing Amsterdammers to take advantage of the beautiful views of the river. Oostelijke Handelskade, a man-made island, is filled with theaters and a thriving nightlife. Passenger Terminal Amsterdam, a cruise terminal, is also located here. The buildings have aroused much interest because of their innovative architecture.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

In the 1990s, the American Backpackers Club named Anchorage \"Best Trail City in the U.S.\" Even if you never leave the city, you will be able to experience the beauty of Alaska\''s wilderness. One warning on the trails, though - although there are leash laws within the city limits, fewer than half of the friendly pooches you meet on the trail will be constrained by a cord, and none of the moose will, so pay attention! If you want to ride on one of the city\''s many trails, you might first want to stop by the Downtown Bicycle Rental shop, just around the corner from the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail. This popular trail runs along the Cook Inlet coastline at the western edge of downtown and looks over the mud flats, which appear emerald green in the summer. Be sure to stay on the trail and off of the flats, though. While appealing to look at, these mud flats consist of glacial silt that has a quicksand reflex to weight; helicopters and fire hoses have to be used to extract people who walk on to these areas. Kincaid Park, located 10 miles (16 kilometers)  from downtown, contains 40 miles (64 kilometers) of trails, many of which are groomed for skiing during the winter. The dirt trails leading through the woods are also used for biking and hiking in the summertime. The Chester Creek Greenbelt, which runs east-west parallel to the southern edge of downtown, is another option. This greenbelt contains parks with benches for resting as well as playgrounds for kids of all ages. Many other trails circle and twist throughout the city—be sure to ask for directions if you\''re longing to find a stroll through the woods.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Barhopping is another favorite pastime in Anchorage, particularly in winter, as it offers a way to spend time with friends while also giving folks a \"spirit-lifting\" way to thumb their noses at the plunging temperatures. Each club in town has a different feel and offers different local specialties. The downtown area\''s most popular circuit seems to be the one where clubs are close enough to skip between without freezing to death, but still distanced enough to encourage a rejuvenating, fast-paced walk from one to the next. Many bars have limited dining options, so a logical place to start a downtown brewery tour would be with a filling stop at the Glacier BrewHouse. From there, check out the dancing at Whale\''s Tail in the Captain Cook Hotel, and meet some unusual locals at Darwin\''s Theory. The most noteworthy bar in town is the midtown Chilkoot Charlie\''s, with its multiple dance floors, bars, bands and consistently bustling crowds. This \"mall\" of bars provides a number of completely different atmospheres and clientèle; you do not have to walk outside to go barhopping here - just head into the next large, low-ceilinged room.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Local Festivals and Events</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\''re interested in local flavor, check out the yearlong series of festivals and local events. Especially noteworthy are the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, the Alaska State Fair, Ship Creek Viewing Platform, Silver Salmon Derby and the Alaska Native Olympics, which draws more than 200 participants. The biggest concerts and events are held at the Sullivan Arena, Alaska\''s largest performance venue.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\''re attracted to art - either for purchase or perusal - there are many locations awaiting you in Anchorage. Galleries and museums here specialize in showcasing the artwork of the Alaska Native cultures. In addition to the museums, noteworthy downtown boutiques include the Oomingmak musk ox producer\''s cooperative, the Rusty Harpoon and the Aurora Fine Arts Gallery. The Alaska Native Heritage Center shines the light on Alaska\''s many indigenous groups, their culture and heritage. The Anchorage Museum at Rasmuson Center has exhibitions on a variety of topics from art, history, science, and ethnography that\''s focused on Alaska and its peoples. While much of the stock in these galleries is Native-related, non-Native Alaskan artists find equal representation with paintings and photographs that focus on the plethora of wildlife and wilderness scenes found around Anchorage.Whether you\''re looking for outdoor activities or cultural events, the selection to choose from is remarkable for a city of Anchorage\''s size. Attend the many festivals and revel in the diversity found within the local population, or spend time exploring the outdoors, which are different from those of any other city. Whatever your interests are, you will find plenty to entertain yourself during your stay.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts and Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\''re looking for a play or a show to catch, you\''ll find plenty of options in Anchorage. The prime venue for the city\''s top shows is the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts. This venue has three theaters and hosts a plethora of performance arts from dance to theater and music concerts. For a slightly different experience, you can make your way to the Alaska Experience Theatre that shows documentaries, as well as a long-standing interactive film on the 1984 earthquake that shook the city to its foundations. One of the best theater companies in the city, the Cyrano\''s Theatre Company has a regular line-up of plays through the year.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (85,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Government Hill</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The oldest district and the northernmost part of Anchorage, Government Hill was one of many places to feel the destruction of the 1964 earthquake. When 400 feet (122 meters) of its bluff collapsed, it destroyed a school and dropped the railroad yard and shipyard by 30 feet (9.1 meters). Only partially rebuilt, its shipyard has six fuel ports, which handle approximately 15 million barrels of petroleum each year. The Alaska Railroad Depot operates daily with freight and passenger service.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ship Creek</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ship Creek was selected as the original tenting site of the pioneers who arrived in the area to build the railroad in 1914 and 1915. They first filled the area located nearby, the Ship Creek Viewing Platform, then spread north up to Government Hill. Visitors who come during summer can experience the fun of amusement rides, car races, and the Anchorage Weekend Market & Festival. Ship Creek is also a great place to be when the salmon are spawning, and it provides excellent salmon fishing, as approximately 9,000 king salmon spawn here yearly. The large parking lots used by fishermen in the summer play host to the ice sculpting contests held during February\''s Anchorage Fur Rendezvous.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">An area teeming with activity and filled with high-rise buildings, businesses, restaurants and hotels, Downtown allows you to experience both the historic and the modern within the space of several blocks. From the small log cabin that houses the ACVB Log Cabin Visitor Information Center, you will find yourself in view of such hotels as the landmark Captain Cook Hotel, the Anchorage Marriott and the Hilton Anchorage. Several blocks away are glass-walled skyscrapers housing offices for multi-billion-dollar oil companies and other businesses. Nearby, the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts offers local and international opera, theater, dance, chorus and symphony performances. From that building\''s second floor, take the Fifth Avenue skyway to overlook the town square as you walk toward the Egan Convention Center. Here you\''ll also find the Anchorage Fifth Avenue Mall. Finally, don\''t miss Captain Cook\''s Resolution Park platform at the Inlet\''s edge. With the telescope available, you can close the 120-mile (193-kilometer) gap between yourself and Mt. McKinley and see why this 20,320-foot (6,194-meter) mountain is referred to as the \"Great One.\" For a scenic train ride that will leave you mesmerized, hop aboard the Alaska Railroad from its Anchorage Depot.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Midtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In this \"practical district,\" you will find schools, gas stations and grocery stores spread across an alluvial plain. There are many types of food here - from Greek and Italian to Chinese and Japanese - as well as a selection of busy nightclubs. Shopping choices here include the Recreational Equipment Inc. (R.E.I.) outdoor store, Barnes & Noble Bookstore and more. Meanwhile, such establishments as the Hampton Inn and SpringHill Suites Anchorage Midtown welcome guests to the area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Spenard District—Central, West</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Considered the \"red light district\" in the 1970s and 1980s due to the heavy presence of massage parlors and escort services, this area has since undergone a revitalization program that has cleaned up the area and brought in many new businesses. The closest thing to \"bohemia\" in Anchorage, this district is home to new cafes and juice bars such as the Organic Oasis. Some of the older Anchorage flavors remain, such as Chilkoot Charlie\''s, with its dirt floor and stump seating. An old-time local favorite is Gwennie\''s Old Alaskan Restaurant. New hotels such as the Holiday Inn Express and older ones such as the Millennium Alaskan Hotel Anchorage conveniently serves visitors staying in the airport area. The Alaska Jewish Museum is also found here and offers an interesting look at the Jewish community in Alaska.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This trail-filled district begins at Dimond Boulevard, home to the Dimond Center and its more than 200 shops. The Siam Cuisine restaurant and the Southside Bistro provide the area with a couple of first-class, yet still casual, dining options. Pockets of business dot the residential areas, which are made up of wide yards and quiet streets. Campbell Creek Greenbelt winds its way through the South and Midtown districts, beginning at Dimond Boulevard and stretching three miles to the east, meanwhile passing by salmon-spawning streams and several small lakes. A number of residential areas circle bodies of water such as Campbell Lake, which is also a floatplane runway; many residents park their floatplanes in their \"backyards\" here. Also in this district, on the far west end, is Kincaid Park. This locale is home to the Blues on the Green Festival, and it also hosts many other special events and races on its 40 square miles of beautiful, wild, moose-filled woods. You can access Kincaid Park by traveling from the downtown Tony Knowles Coastal Trail to its southernmost point, which ends at Kincaid Park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">University District—Central</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tucked between Midtown and Muldoon, this district is partly composed of the private Alaska Pacific University. It is spread over an expanse of nearly one square mile (2.6 square kilometers), which is home to two small lakes and a multitude of walking and biking trails. On these casual campuses, professors are nearly always referred to by their first names, while students sometimes cross-country ski to class. Many sky bridges and buildings are joined by hallways in order to help students escape the elements.

For a less traditional yet equally engaging approach, opt for Betty\''s Hope Sugar Plantation. The site has existed since 1650 and offers unparalleled insight into the island\''s agricultural history. Another option is the Dockyard Museum, which was converted from its former use as Royal Navy Dockyard quarters. As for galleries, you\''ll find them scattered around Antigua. Stick to the more popular areas and you\''re sure to see plenty of local art.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beaches</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Beach days in Antigua entail everything from snorkeling and scuba diving to good old-fashioned sunbathing. When you aren\''t busy discovering secret coves on foot, you can rely on the following destinations for near-perfect outings. The white-sand shores of Dickenson Bay are perfect for strolling between the surf and the buzzing bars and restaurants just inland. Half Moon Bay boasts the same stunning color scheme but tends to appeal to a quieter crowd that prefers relative seclusion. And for the best in family fun, check out calm Pigeon Point Beach, where you\''ll have lots of local company.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chief among the performing arts groups on the island is the Antigua Community Players, which sponsors musical programs and original plays and productions. The island also plays host to a local dance troupe known as the Antigua Dance Theatre. Although the schedule can be inconsistent, the dance group puts on impressive public performances on occasion.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Every spring, Antigua hosts a sailing week during which sailors from all over the map converge for a massive, week-long regatta. It is a must-see island tradition and promises a great time for sailors and spectators alike. Still, cricket is a way of life in Antigua, and nothing beats catching a local game. Ask around while touring the island or check the local listings to find a match when you\''re in town.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are both open-late bars and clubs in Antigua, particularly in the tourist havens. Start your evening in St. John\''s with good food, delicious cocktails, and a little bit of dancing downtown. Then check out hotspots like Abracadabra in English Harbour. You\''ll find a comfortable age range at most nightlife venues on the island, be it a beach bar or an electronic-music-blaring disco.For a different sort of nightlife entertainment, Antigua has two main casinos with gaming tables, plus several others offering slots only. Look for these in the departure lounge area at the V.C. Bird International Airport.

Besides the designer boutiques around Nationalestraat, the Meir is one of the most prestigious shopping streets in Europe offering a wide range of department stores and boutiques. The Groenplaats and Huidevetterstraat are also worthy alternatives.If you want to buy diamonds it makes sense to visit the certified shops in the vicinity of Antwerp\''s renowned Diamond Center near the Central Station. You can also visit the Diamond Museum for an exciting day out.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Antwerp has acquired a reputation for innovative and exciting ballet, with the Royal Ballet School at the helm of its internationally renown repertoire. The principal ballet company is the Royal Flanders Ballet (Koninklijk Ballet van Vlaanderen).The Royal Flanders Philharmonic (Koninklijk Filharmonisch Orkest) is also well-known and can be heard at the Singel concert hall where mostly modern and contemporary concerts are performed.Antwerp\''s theater repertoire rivals those of New York City and London, with over 100 active theater groups calling this city their home. Most performances are in the native languages, however, and tourists not familiar with either French, Dutch or German may find it hard to locate a show they understand. The Stadsschouwburg is Antwerp\''s premier destination for the performing arts, alongside others like the Arenberg and a multitude of smaller theaters where independent companies fill the stage a few nights per week, all year long. Puppet shows are quite common as well.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums & Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For art lovers, Antwerp offers an array of galleries and museums to fit everyone\''s taste. The most popular art museum is the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in \''t Zuid, while contemporary artists are exhibited at the M HKA or the Museum of Contemporary Art. Lesser known, but equally enchanting, are specialty museums like the Fotomuseum, the ModeMuseum and the Museum De Reede with its collection of graphic art by the likes of Edward Munch and Goya.There\''s plenty for history buffs to explore as well. While the Plantin-Moretus Museum and Rubenshuis showcase art history, the Museum aan de Stroom delves into local culture. The Middelheim Open Air Sculpture Museum and the Vleeshuis with its collection of musical instruments are also quite intriguing.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A night out in Antwerp is an inviting prospect with a whole host of options to explore. Beer is a local passion, one that is celebrated with much ardor at the Bierhuiske. Here, over 300 varieties of beer are served to adoring fans of the brew in a setting that is remarkably homely for such a large pub. The Den Engel and De Vagant are other worthy contenders.The city\''s dance clubs are no less exciting, with stalwarts like the Café d\''anvers to look forward to. This legendary dance club has been in business for close to two decades and regularly features as one of the nation\''s top nightlife venues. Lovers of live music should head to De Muze, Antwerp\''s authentic jazz cafe.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinemas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The UGC Antwerpen multiplex near the Central Station and the Metropolis are the city\''s top choices for mainstream cinema. The Metropolis, in particular, impresses with its massive screens; located just outside the city center it was until recently among the largest multiplexes in the world.

It encompasses the area around the Cathedral of Our Lady and the Grote Markt. The Vlaeykensgang is an example of the picturesque medieval streets that riddle the neighborhood, while the numerous paintings of Peter Paul Rubens on display at the city\''s museums bear testament to Antwerp\''s Golden Age. The destruction caused by WWI and WWII impacted the vitality of the Old City, but recent renovation projects have restored it to its former grandeur.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Quartier Latin</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Some great window-shopping is guaranteed in Quartier Latin. Antwerp has earned a place among the world\''s fashion capitals thanks to the efforts of numerous young Flemish designers who have received international acclaim. Some of them include Nadine Wynants, the extravagant Walter van Beirendonck and the popular Ann De Meulemeester. You can find the new fashion district of Antwerp around Nationalestraat and the more mainstream boutiques in the back streets of Huidervetterstraat.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Port of Antwerp</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Antwerp is the second largest seaport in Europe, following Rotterdam. The harbor was originally situated in the district which is now called <em>\''t Eilandje</em> or \"The Island.\" This district has definitely preserved some of the authentic harbor vibe. Expansion pushed it north to the left bank area, where you can now find large docks and Europe\''s largest energy facilities.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sailors Quarter</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The main Red Light District of Antwerp is situated in what is called Schipperskwartier or Rosse Buurt, located between Sint Paulusstraat and Brouwersvliet, not so far from the Grote Markt square. The mood is not as playful as it is in Amsterdam, but you can still find some trouble to get into.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The South</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The main attraction in the <em>Zuid</em>, or South of Antwerp, is the Royal Museum of Fine Arts which is housed in a monumental, neo-classical building. This area really started to buzz a few years ago after numerous successful redevelopment projects. Now you\''ll find many fine brasseries and bistros that serve great food at reasonable prices. The annual amusement fair, Sinksenfoor, is held here in June.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Meir and de Keyserlei</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">These are Antwerp\''s main shopping streets and among the prettiest in Europe. Most of the Meir is reserved for pedestrians only and the stylish buildings with international department stores are quite a sight. You\''ll find a wide range of trendy boutiques along the main thoroughfare and down side-streets.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Central Station</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As you walk down de Keyserlei at the end of your shopping spree, you\''ll catch a glimpse of the magnificent Central Station. The surrounding area is a strange mixture of nouveau riche and underground cool. The shops on de Keyserlei and the fabulous postmodern Astrid Park Plaza Hotel stand not far from raucous, loud bars in Statiestraat. If you walk from Koningin Astrid Square towards De Coninck Square you\''ll wander into Antwerp\''s small Chinatown and the more discreet Red Light District.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Jewish Antwerp and the Diamond Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Antwerp is also the \"Diamond Capital of the World\" and near the Central Station, you will find the Diamond District. The streets between the station and the city park, called Stadspark, also make up the city\''s Jewish Quarter. Estimates put the number of Jewish citizens in Antwerp from 15,000 to 20,000, their population more than halved by the upheaval of the Second World War. Nevertheless, the city is still home to the largest concentration of Orthodox Jews in northern Europe. The Great Synagogue, Hollandse Synagogue and Oosten Synagogue are three of the most prominent Jewish landmarks in this quarter.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

If you are putting on skis for the first time or are still in the beginning phases, go somewhere else, because these trails are unforgiving. Out of Aspen Mountain\''s 76 trails, 65 percent fall into the advanced or expert category - double black diamonds are everywhere. On the west side of the mountain are several intermediate trails (i.e. Blues), but only a few like Roach Run and International are cruisers. If you want big bumps, almost every steep has them, and the tree skiing is awesome. After years of banning snowboarders, Aspen Mountain finally gave in at the end of the 2001 ski season and opened its slopes to boarders.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although developers keep chipping away at Aspen Highland\''s throwback appeal, the area is still a major draw for backcountry enthusiasts looking for lots of trees and steeps. The Highland Bowl, with its fan of double black diamond runs, is a true favorite of locals. The 112 trails have terrain suitable for all skill levels, but if you are looking for the cruising runs (minus the Greens), you might choose another mountain, because these slopes are loaded with bumps. You will constantly hear the locals talking about it, especially for spring skiing when the moguls really begin to soften. If you are still in the snowplow phase and could use some instructions, spend a few days on this beginner-friendly mountain. Buttermilk has one of the most extensive and thorough ski schools around, and after a few days of lessons, you can cruise with far more confidence. This is also the place to bring the kids. The wee ones have their own lift and hill here. Out of the 43 trails, almost 75 percent are in the beginner and intermediate range. Snowmass mountain has come along way from its early days when it was known as \"Slowmass.\" Now, thanks to three terrain parks, the area is a favorite with snowboarders and even attracts the wild two-day Boardfest. In addition, Snowmass, the largest of the four area mountains, boasts incredibly diverse terrain which includes cruising runs, mogul fields and stretching glades. Beginners may be out of luck (only 7 percent of the 83 trails are greens), but intermediate and advanced skiers will find plenty to their liking, especially on the double black steeps off the Black Burn lift. Because this area is tourist heavy the locals tend to avoid it. If the lift prices in Aspen scare you off, do what a good deal of the locals living paycheck to paycheck do: head to Sunlight. Located 40 miles (64 kilometers) outside of Aspen the terrain is 75 percent beginner/intermediate, but the lift ticket is the cheapest around.Other winter activities include mushing with the Krabloonik Dogsleds and ice-skating at the indoor Aspen Ice Garden. Both the Aspen Cross Country Center and the Snowmass Club Cross Country Center offer nordic skiing on over 50 miles  (81 kilometers) of groomed trails. Trail maps are available in the local ski shops and at the Aspen Visitors Center. The Ashcroft Ski Touring Center also has groomed trails, and after cross-country skiing, you can refuel at the nearby Pine Creek Cookhouse. Although most locals despise the activity, snowmobile rides are also available in the area. Or, you can strap yourself into a pair of snowshoes and get a new perspective on hiking.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Biking</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you did not bring your bike, you can rent one at a number of area shops. Mountain bikers have a number of trail options for all skill levels. Technical nuts can take on the Government Trail. Those who prefer to take it easy can pedal along the Rio Grande trail or try the Lincoln Creek Road, a four-wheel drive road that ascends to the Ruby ghost town. Guided bike tours are available through Blazing Adventures, and will even transport you up to Maroon Lake so you only have to ride down. Road bikers can test their lungs on Independence Pass or ride up Maroon Creek Road for a look at Colorado\''s famed Maroon Bells. A hot air balloon ride is a great way to see the valley, and jeep tours through Blazing Adventures are available for those looking for a bumpy thrill. For the really adventurous Aspen Paragliding provides lessons.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Other Outdoor Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When the seasons change and the weather heats up, Aspen and the Roaring Fork Valley transform into havens for outdoor summer activities. Campgrounds, such as the Silver Queen and Difficult, fill with RVs and car campers, and tourists flood the town for the music and foods festivals. Fishermen wade into the Frying Pan and Roaring Fork Rivers gathering new fish tales, while rafters splash through the rapids under the guidance of Blazing Adventures. Mountain and road bikes adorn the top of sport utility vehicles, and the jet set begins to sweat, except for those opting for a game of high altitude golf at the Aspen Golf Course.  A myriad of hiking trails run up the surrounding mountains, and many are easily accessible from Downtown. Both the Ute Trial and the Aspen Mountain Trail reward you with views of Aspen and the surrounding valley. The Rio Grande Trail runs through lower Downtown along the Roaring Fork River and heads down the valley. It is an easy alternative to trails that require serious elevation gains. If you want to hike with the locals, head over to the Smuggler Road Trail, a relatively easy 1,000-foot (305-meter) ascent on a dirt road to a sundeck overlooking Downtown. Or if time is an issue try the Maroon Creek Trail. More experienced hikers can trek the endless trail system in the surrounding backcountry. For a real challenge, you can set off on an expedition to summit one of the 14,000-foot (4,267-meter) peaks (fourteeners) towering above the valley, including the most photographed mountains in North America, the Maroon Bells. The Maroon Peak Trail provides great access to the peaks.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On days when you aren\''t out in nature, you can check out Aspen\''s arts and culture side. A plethora of galleries in the Downtown area display everything from modern art to decorative art. The Aspen Art Museum, located in an old hydroelectric plant in lower Downtown, hosts rotating exhibitions from established contemporary artists. The museum also offers classes for aspiring painters. Smaller galleries include the Huntsman Gallery, the Omnibus Gallery and the Joel Soroka Gallery. History buffs will enjoy exploring how life was in the Victorian age at the Wheeler/Stallard House Museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">During the summer you can catch a number of plays and musicals at Theater in the Park, and the Aspen Stage group presents staged readings of original work at a number of area venues. And you can always deck the fancy duds for a night at the opera when productions are running at the Wheeler Opera House.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Aspen is known for its love for luxury, and this lifestyle is reflected in the many designer boutiques that line the downtown area\''s pedestrian malls. Besides international luxury brands like Prada and Ralph Lauren, the town has a good selection of locally-owned stores like the Pitkin County Dry Goods and Kemo Sabe for Western clothing as well as the wonderful Aspen Saturday Market between June and October where you can browse local crafts and art alongside a selection of fresh produce from around the area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Festival-goers will find something going on in Aspen at all times of the year. During the height of ski season, the world\''s best comedians converge on the town for a laugh-a-thon like no other at the US Comedy Arts Festival. Summer brings the Aspen Music Festival. This celebration of classical music spans nine weeks and most concerts, which consist of both up-and-coming and professional musicians, takes place in the famed Music Tent. The Aspen Santa Fe Ballet hosts the Aspen Dance Festival during July and August of each year. This festival of movement invites dance troupes from across the nation to present productions on everything from ballet to flamenco. The renowned Food & Wine Festival brings together sommeliers, superstar chefs, vintners and gastronomy aficionados for a food fete in the spring. This event was originally started to attract people to town in the off-season, but has now blossomed into one of the food world\''s premier events that usually sells out. Perhaps the most popular festival is Jazz Aspen Snowmass. Over Labor Day, some of the biggest names in jazz, rock, blues and reggae perform at the base of the Snowmass slopes. Tickets go fast and hotel rooms are impossible to find, so make sure you reserve well in advance. In the fall, the Aspen Filmfest takes place, bringing out the celebrities. More than 100 independent films, shorts and documentaries roll on area movie screens.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (122,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><em>Ski Magazine</em> consistently refers to Downtown Aspen as the ski capital of North America, and it\''s easy to see why. The Cooper Avenue, Hyman Avenue and Mill Street Pedestrian malls act as the centerpieces of the area. Each of the tree-lined streets features old Victorian buildings and brick retail units filled with hip shops, eclectic dining and cool local pubs. But the malls are just the beginning. From Main Street to Durant Avenue, the selection of places to eat, sleep, shop, drink, dance, tune your skis, rent a bike and check out art are seemingly endless. The ski slopes of Aspen Mountain serve as the scenic backdrop to Downtown.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">West End</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The West End is a quiet residential nook filled with authentic Victorian homes. Walking through the streets, with Shadow Mountain looming in the background, you would never know that you were in a ritzy ski town. The locals are friendly and the tourists are absent, making you feel like you belong there. In this residential area, you will find a good number of hotels and condos scattered about the West End, especially on Main Street. The lower West End is where Walter Paepcke brought the \"Aspen Idea\" to life with the construction of the Aspen Meadows Conference Center and Hotel, which houses the Aspen Institute. This 40-acre (16-hectare) spread is also home to the famous Music Tent, the Aspen Center for Physics, the Harris Concert Hall and the Paepcke Auditorium. If you fancy a bit of Bauhaus architecture, you will see plenty of impressive, long horizontal structures scattered about the landscape. Just east of Aspen Meadows is the Hallam Lake Nature Preserve, home to the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies. This is a great place to spend a few hours relaxing in the summer.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">East End</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Roaring Fork River splits the East End, and there are so many trees spread across this neighborhood, that you get the feeling you have stumbled into a residential forest. If you are looking to get away from the hubbub of Downtown, the East End streets are a perfect place to go for peace and quiet. Or, after a long day on the slopes, you might instead want to check out the Aspen Club & Spa.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Snowmass Village</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although Snowmass Village has only been around since 1968 and is purely a ski resort built from scratch, the town has almost 2,000 year-round condo dwellers. Waking every morning to the towering peaks of Mt. Daly and Snowmass Peak, and being able to walk out your door to the ski slopes is a major draw. Snowmass, the largest of the four ski mountains, struggled for years to break out of Aspen\''s shadow and establish its own identity. It eventually became the mountain of choice for summer festivals, including the renowned Jazz Aspen Snowmass and the Snowmass Rodeo. A major conference center attracted business gatherings and developers, while the Snowmass Club Cross Country Center carved out ski routes for sports enthusiasts. The Snowmass Club Golf Course was also established for those looking to have some summer-time fun.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Roaring Fork Valley</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When you leave Aspen and head west into the Roaring Fork Valley, you step into a time when horses ruled the west and ranching was the way of life. But the cowboys and ranchers are slowly facing the effects of modernization, as small towns like Basalt become targets of commercialism. Many visitors to Aspen opt to spend time in the valley, especially in the summer, to get a true feel of the mountains. Many fishermen are also drawn to the waters of the Frying Pan and Roaring Fork Rivers to the test their fly fishing skills. If you venture into towns like Basalt, Carbondale, Old Snowmass and El Jebel, expect to find a low-key, local atmosphere. Most of Aspen\''s blue-collar workers are based here. Perhaps the most eccentric town is Woody Creek, famous for former resident Hunter S. Thompson. He could often be found enjoying a cold beer at the Woody Creek Tavern.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Many concerts and performances take place between May and October in numerous open-air venues such as the Lykavittos Theatre overlooking the city. The major cultural event is the Athens Festival - one of Europe\''s largest summer festivals held each year from June to September. Younger crowds are attracted by the three-day Rockwave Festival held each July.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Greek <em>joie de vivre</em> and love for life translates perfectly to a vibrant and eclectic music scene that captures all of the passion and lively spirit. From traditional tavernas playing live music to world-class venues, the range of music is diverse. The winter season in Athens includes great concerts at the splendid Athens Concert Hall as well as opera and ballet performances by the Greek National Opera. Also worth mentioning are the city\''s <em>rebetiko</em> and jazz clubs, such as Astrofeggia and the Half Note Jazz Club.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A theater culture that spans thousands of years, Athens is home to some outstanding venues that showcase Greek talent as well as international artists and troupes. Performances at the historic National Theatre truly stand out amongst the dozens of theatrical productions which take place in the city. There are also many art exhibitions to choose from, including those held at Gazi Technopolis Manos Chatzidakis, Athinais Cultural Centre and Artower Agora.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you fancy watching the latest movie, the language barrier is no problem as all movies are featured in the original language with Greek subtitles (with the exception of some films for children). There is a huge choice of cinemas in Athens from multiplexes to independent cinemas and seasonal open-air theaters. One of the more enjoyable experiences is watching a movie under the stars at one of the city\''s open-air cinemas - such as the one at Aegli, in the Zappion Gardens or the magical Cine Paris.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Family-Friendly</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Children will also have a great time in Athens. They can explore the National Garden, visit the mystical Koutouki Cave and the world\''s third-largest bird collection at the Attica Zoological Park. They can even see the creations of other children, exhibited at the Museum of Greek Children\''s Art. For outdoor amusement park fun, the Allou! Fun Park is Greek\''s largest theme park and promises a whole lot of fun!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the disposal of both children and adults are the city\''s excellent beaches and watersports facilities, such as the Astir Beach Club in Vouliagmeni, Schinias Beach and Karavi Beach Club in Marathon, and the EOT beach clubs in Alimos. Other sports facilities can be found at the Glyfada Golf Course and hikers can head to the Mt Parnitha National Park, just north of the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city\''s excellent shops present an additional recreational opportunity. Athens is a great place for clothes shopping; women in particular will appreciate both the quality and the attractive prices of clothes sold at the city\''s elegant boutiques. You can also shop for works of art, antiques, home accessories and exotic souvenirs. Among the city\''s many shopping districts, Plaka and Monastiraki stand out along with Ermou and Athinas streets.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A vibrant metropolis, Athens is famous for its nightlife. From local dive bars to chic cocktail lounges and dusk-to-dawn clubs, this city has it all. In the heart of bustling Plaka, Brettos Bar draws crowds partly thanks to its gorgeous interiors and also due to its house-made drinks. Another favorite is Alexander\''s Bar, which retains its old-world charm and dates as far back as the 18th Century in the heart of the city\''s other hotspot, Syntagma Square. For ocean views and a mellow vibe, Island is hard to beat while Dybbuk spins some of the best tracks in the city within its neon-lit walls.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (131,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Acropolis</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most memorable part of your visit to Athens could very well be the ascent to the Acropolis. The magnificent Parthenon, built on top of the hill in the 5th Century BCE, is one of the greatest architectural masterpieces of all time. Within the vicinity, you\''ll find the Theatre of Dionysus, the world\''s oldest theater and an architectural marvel. Great plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides were first performed in this open-air space with perfect acoustical clarity to crowds of 250,000.Many major archaeological sites are also located around the Acropolis. A bit to the west, is the Pnyx (the birthplace of democracy), where Athenian citizens assembled and voted on major political issues. If visitors venture north, they\''ll be able to stroll through the Attalos Arcade in the Ancient Agora (ancient marketplace) as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle once did. Other famed monuments in the area include the Temple of Olympian Zeus, the Keramikos Cemetery and the Hephaistos Temple.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Syntagma Square</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Syntagma Square is the heart of modern Athens. It is home to the majestic Parliament Building, which was built in 1840 as the Royal Palace. The hourly changing of the guard in front of Parliament by soldiers dressed in colorful traditional costumes is a great photo opportunity. All major attractions such as Plaka, the Acropolis, the National Garden, the museums of Vassilissis, Sophias Avenue, and the upscale boutiques of Kolonaki and Ermou Street are only a short walk away. The Syntagma Metro Station features an exhibition of archaeological finds.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Plaka</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Plaka, the picturesque old town of Athens, is perched on the north and east slopes of the Acropolis. It has been continuously inhabited for over 5,000 years. Visitors will need several days to explore all the treasures hidden in its narrow streets, most of which are closed to traffic. Few other places are so filled with historic sites - ancient monuments, Byzantine churches, mosques and stately 19th-century houses all stand side by side here. Scattered throughout these quarters are sidewalk cafes, tavernas hidden in vine-covered backyards, and shops selling clothes, handicrafts and exotic souvenirs. This lively neighborhood is an inviting place for a leisurely stroll.One of the most unusual sights in Plaka is the Lysicrates Monument, which dates back to the 4th Century BCE. Anafiotika, a tiny Cycladic village consisting of picturesque white-washed houses, is also a popular attraction. Plaka also features Byzantine churches from the 11th and 12th Centuries, such as the Church of Panagia Gorgoepikoos.Among other must-see attractions is the Roman Agora and the Tower of the Winds, which dates back to the 1st Century BCE. The Kanellopoulos Museum is a great place to learn about ancient Greek and Byzantine art. The beautifully restored old mansions of Plaka also house other museums including the Museum of Popular Instruments, the Greek Museum of Childhood and the Vlassis Frissiras Museum of Contemporary European Art.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Monastiraki</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Monastiraki Flea Market is located on the narrow streets between Monastiraki Square, the Ancient Agora and Assomaton Square. Overlooking Monastiraki Square is the Tzisdarakis Mosque, which features a splendid pottery collection. A short stroll away is the Central Market on Athinas Street which offers an overwhelming variety of seafood, meat and vegetables.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Psirri, Thissio & Gazi</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Psirri was once a run-down neighborhood, but has been transformed into the trendiest entertainment district in Athens. Its narrow streets are teeming with traditional tavernas, elegant restaurants, fashionable bars and art galleries.A brief walk towards the Acropolis will bring you to Thissio, one of the city\''s oldest neighborhoods. Its beautifully restored mansions now house gourmet restaurants, hot nightspots and cozy cafes.The Gazi district is home to several large nightclubs and impressively styled restaurants. This area takes its name from a former gas factory which was later transformed into the Gazi Technopolis cultural center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museum Mile</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The section of Vassilissis Sophias Avenue between Syntagma Square and the Hilton features several world-class museums that attract thousands of visitors each year. The newly renovated Benaki Museum contains a huge collection highlighting 8,000 years of Greek history. The Museum of Cycladic Art specializes in splendid prehistoric works of art from the Aegean Islands, while the Byzantine Museum deals with medieval Greece. The history of warfare from prehistoric times until the 20th Century comes alive at the War Museum. More peaceful exhibits can be found at the National Art Gallery, which features magnificent works of contemporary Greek art.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kolonaki</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The streets around Kolonaki Square feature the most elegant boutiques in Athens. The square itself, officially named Filikis Eterias, is the favorite meeting place of celebrities and beautiful people. They can be seen relaxing at any of Kolonaki\''s numerous cafés after a shopping spree, or lounging in the excellent gourmet restaurants and chic bars at night. Kolonaki lies on the slopes of Lykavittos Hill, the city\''s best vantage point.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Exarchion</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The scenery changes just a few blocks away from elegant Kolonaki. The area around Exarchion Square is dominated by rock music bars, jazz clubs and traditional tavernas which are frequented by students and intellectuals. While this is a neighborhood most avoid, for the intrepid few that make it here, there\''s great rembetika music and an alternative vibe to be found along the graffiti-lined streets.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Panepistimiou & Stadiou Streets</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">These two streets connect Syntagma Square with Omonia Square. As well as shops and restaurants, they feature some of the city\''s most beautiful 19th-century buildings. Among them is the so-called Panepistimiou Street (officially named El. Venizelou Street), along with the university and National Library. The historic Iliou Melathron Mansion now houses the Numismatic Museum and the National History Museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Omonia Square</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Omonia is the busiest square in the city. This once neglected part of Athens has recently been upgraded with the opening of a metro station. Many of the inexpensive but shabby stores typical of the area have now been replaced by trendy boutiques.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Patission Street</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Patission Street, officially named 28 Oktovriou Street, is one of the city\''s major thoroughfares. At No. 42 is the majestic Technical University, a splendid example of 19th-century architecture. Next door is the National Archaeological Museum, one of the world\''s greatest museums, housing an outstanding collection of ancient Greek art. Many fine boutiques can be found further north, past Kodringtonos Street. The best place to rest after a shopping spree is in any one of the numerous cafes and tavernas of the Fokionos Negri pedestrian zone in Kypseli.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Piraeus</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Piraeus - the port town of Athens - is located on a peninsula, ten kilometers (six miles) southwest of central Athens. It features a busy commercial port and a Sunday flea market in the streets near the metro station. The most picturesque part of Piraeus is the Mikrolimano fishing harbor, with its row of traditional fish restaurants. Other good places for eating fish are the numerous seafood eateries of Akti Themistokleous Street, on the peninsula\''s eastern coast. Traces of the area\''s 2,500-year-old history can be found at the Piraeus Archaeological Museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Glyfada & Vouliagmeni</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city\''s southern suburbs are located along the Apollo Coast and feature a string of beaches as well as numerous restaurants and nightclubs. One of these suburbs, Glyfada, boasts a golf course, an excellent shopping area on Metaxa Street and elegant restaurants and bars. Further south you\''ll find the exclusive resort town of Vouliagmeni, renowned for its luxurious hotels, sophisticated restaurants and sailing clubs. The resort also features excellent beaches and watersports facilities at the Astir Beach Club.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kifissia</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The northern suburb of Kifissia is the destination of choice for the wealthy.

Their home is Turner Field, one of Major League Baseball\''s most modern and entertaining facilities, featuring restaurants, a museum and interactive games. Home games for the NFL\''s Atlanta Falcons are played at the Georgia Dome, while across the street, Philips Arena is home to the Atlanta Hawks and the National Hockey League\''s newest franchise, the Atlanta Thrashers. For exciting college action, step over to the Georgia Tech campus in Midtown or Georgia State downtown to watch their athletes compete in two dozen varsity sports.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With over 180 acres of lakes, fields, tennis courts and bike paths, Midtown\''s Piedmont Park plays host to concerts, arts and crafts shows, and the annual Atlanta Dogwood Festival. In the heart of downtown, Centennial Olympic Park, with its spectacular five-concentric-ring fountain, is a popular spot with lunch hour sun-seekers. A bit more bucolic and relaxed is Chastain Park in Buckhead, which features a two and a half mile walking trail and hosts a summer concert series. For the lover of natural wonders, take a short drive east to Stone Mountain State Park. This 3,000-acre expanse of forests and lakes centers around the park\''s namesake, a chunk of solid granite that rises 1,683 feet and is adorned with the world\''s largest bas-relief sculpture. Located in the northwest corner of Piedmont Park, the Atlanta Botanical Gardens houses floral specimens from the four corners of the globe, as well as a family-friendly children\''s garden. Flora is fine, but it can\''t roar like fauna, which can be found in abundance at Zoo Atlanta, located within the grounds of beautiful Grant Park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lovers of high culture will discover a world of spiraling wonder at the High Museum of Art in Midtown. This architectural marvel is home to over 10,000 works, and plays frequent host to touring collections, such as those of Pablo Picasso and Norman Rockwell. For all-out fascination, few attractions can match the Fernbank Museum of Natural History, which also offers a five-story movie screen in its IMAX theater. Or for a refreshing twist on history, learn that of the planet\''s most famous soft drink at the World of Coca-Cola Museum at Underground Atlanta. Other niche museums include the College Football Hall of Fame, the Center for Puppetry Arts, the Delta Flight Museum and the National Center for Civic & Human Rights.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Historical Landmarks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The legacy of Atlanta\''s past is given its rightful due in Buckhead at the Atlanta History Center, just down West Paces Ferry Road from the Governor\''s Mansion. In addition to its excellent museum, the history center maintains an expansive property of gardens and trails, complete with an authentically-restored working plantation. Of course, no event played a more prominent role in the history of Atlanta than the Civil War. The Battle of Kennesaw Mountain was perhaps the South\''s most significant victory in the fight for Atlanta in 1864, and this slice of history is immortalized at the 3,000-acre Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield. For more on Atlanta\''s role in the Civil War, visit the Cyclorama in Grant Park, a 365 degree mural that depicts the Battle of Atlanta. And no view of Atlanta history would be complete without a glance through the eyes of Margaret Mitchell. The Margaret Mitchell House and Museum in Midtown is where she wrote most of the legendary epic \"Gone With the Wind.\" Just east of downtown, the Jimmy Carter Center occupies a 30-acre compound of gardens and pools, and commands an impressive view of the city. Just down the road, another of Atlanta\''s favorite sons is honored at the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site. For an often overlooked glance into Atlanta\''s past, stop by the Oakland Cemetery where you\''ll find a veritable Who\''s Who of Atlanta history, literature, politics and society dating back to 1850.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Atlanta\''s premier venue for stage events is also one of her most beloved and storied landmarks. The Fabulous Fox Theatre was built in 1916 at the corner of Peachtree Street and Ponce de Leon, as a temple for the Shriners fraternal organization. Today, the Fox plays host to myriad cultural events, including concerts, musicals, opera, ballet, and regular performances by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. A few blocks down Peachtree, the Woodruff Performing Arts Center is the home turf of the Alliance Theatre Company, and also sponsors a full schedule of ballet and children\''s shows. Numerous other companies compete to produce a crowded theater schedule each year in Atlanta. Among the most popular venues are Midtown\''s Shakespeare Tavern and Seven Stages Theatre.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For top-notch classical entertainment, nothing beats the summer classics series at Chastain Park Amphitheatre. This 6,000 seat pavilion plays host to the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra from June through August, as some of the biggest names in show business perform to the accompaniment of the ASO. If you like your music a bit louder, head down I-85 to the HiFi Buys Amphitheatre. This outdoor venue features 7,000 covered seats and an expansive, sloping lawn to accommodate 12,000 more. Recent bookings have included such powerhouses as the Dave Matthews Band and the Lilith Fair. The top among smaller venues is Blind Willie\''s, a tiny Virginia-Highlands dive that offers an intimate setting for some of the best local talent and legendary stars working in blues today. For true variety, head over to the Variety Playhouse in Little Five Points. Harmony and soft strings are the keys at Eddie\''s Attic in Decatur, where such prominent acts as the Indigo Girls frequently drop in.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Atlanta\''s booming nightlife is an eclectic mix of down-home pubs, craft cocktail bars and glitzy nightclubs. Much of the city\''s nightlife centers around Midtown, with the Opera topping the list of this neighborhood\''s dance clubs. Not far behind are the trendy Lava Lounge and Reign. In Buckhead, the Tongue & Groove rules the roost. The MJQ Concourse may be one of the city\''s oldest but it remains a stalwart when it comes to a lively place to enjoy a night on the town.There are several fantastic bars like the Porter Beer Bar for craft brews, speakeasies like Eleanor\''s hidden behind a freezer door at Muss & Turner, and the Polaris atop the Hyatt Regency Atlanta for panoramic views of Downtown. If you wish to venture off the beaten path, try the Sister Louisa\''s Church of the Living Room & Ping Pong Emporium - a local bar that\''s better known for its eccentric decor than its culinary offer.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (141,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As in many cities, Atlanta\''s downtown serves as the center of business and government. It is not, however, the hub of the social or cultural scene, and other than fine dining or professional sports events, it pretty much shuts down after business hours. The ever-changing skyline is dominated by sky-high hotels and office buildings. There is perhaps none more impressive than the Peachtree Center, which serves the business community as a commercial and leisure hub. Most major chain hotels are represented here, as well as many of the world\''s most well-known corporations, such as the world headquarters of Coca-Cola. The Georgia World Congress Center plays host to a never-ending string of trade shows, while in the southern corner of downtown you\''ll find the golden-domed Georgia State Capitol Building. Opened in 1989, the enclosed mall of shops and restaurants known as Underground Atlanta also houses the most comprehensive division of the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau. Standing near the entrance is the World of Coca-Cola, the soft-drink giant\''s interactive museum. For athletics, visit the 71,000-seat Georgia Dome, home of the Atlanta Falcons, or check out Philips Arena, featuring Hawks basketball and Thrashers hockey. Across the street, the massive CNN Center is home to cable television\''s first 24-hour news network.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Midtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Midtown\''s skyline is dominated by mighty hotels such as the Four Seasons and Sheraton Colony Square standing side-by-side with the regional headquarters of such giants as IBM and BellSouth. Midtown is home to the city\''s greatest concentration of cultural outlets, including the fabulous Fox Theater, the High Museum of Art, and the Woodruff Arts Center which hosts the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Known for its diversity, Midtown is home to much of Atlanta\''s gay community. You\''ll see plenty of rainbow flags fluttering from porches of the beautifully restored Victorians between Ponce and 10th Street. From the mansion dwellers in Ansley Park, to the seedier elements that haunt the liquor stores of Ponce de Leon and the grungy-cum-preppy types that wander around Georgia Tech, a broad cross-section of Atlanta natives will greet you on the sidewalk. Despite the neighborhood\''s reputation for glamorous clubs and fine dining, the unquestioned social center of Midtown is Piedmont Park, a 180-acre expanse of green where Atlantans turn out to walk their canine companions.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Buckhead</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The legends of how Buckhead earned its unusual moniker are varied, but most center around the mounting of a slain deer over the door of a 19th-century public house. Today, the wild tavern tradition is still in full swing. Despite the regular disorder brought on by the drinking crowd, Buckhead\''s downtown area remains safe, and is home to many fine shops, restaurants and spas. World-class hotels like the Ritz-Carlton and the Grand Hyatt Atlanta stand steps away from the city\''s most elegant shopping venues in Phipps Plaza and Lenox Square. As you move away from central Buckhead, a growing battalion of high-rise luxury apartments and condos attract the city\''s prosperous up-and-comers, while the tree-lined neighborhoods west of Peachtree live on as exquisite enclaves of old Atlanta money. Just a mile down this awe-inspiring stretch of road sits the Georgia Governor\''s Mansion.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Virginia-Highland</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">More commonly known as \"the Highlands,\" this largely residential neighborhood centers on the intersection of the Virginia and North Highland avenues. Most points are within walking distance of the Jimmy Carter Center in Inman Park, Emory University in Druid Hills, and Piedmont Park in Midtown. High rents have banished the struggling artists downtown, but in their place have come numerous galleries, representing the city\''s best mix of modern and folk art. Although not as glitzy as Buckhead, shopping is a casual pleasure, and the quirky boutiques here draw a large window-gazing crowd. Young and middle-aged professionals mix easily with a mild influx of students from the nearby university at the Highlands\'' bars and restaurants. A vibrant nightlife thumps through the laid-back atmosphere at such pubs as the Dark Horse Tavern. Highbrow restaurants like Southern-influenced Harvest rub amicable shoulders with popular brazier joints such as Neighbors and Moe\''s & Joe\''s.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Little Five Points</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This conglomeration of second-hand shops, piercing parlors, funky bars and music venues is bordered by the old neighborhoods of Inman Park and Candler Park, pricing much of the real estate well beyond the range of the young rebels that flock here. Many nicely-restored bungalows and post-Civil War era homes line the peaceful streets nearby, including a good number of respectable bed-and-breakfasts. Good eats are plentiful in Little Five Points, but fine dining has thus far eluded the rough-edged neighborhood. One notable exception is the Flying Biscuit Cafe, home of Atlanta\''s best breakfast.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">East Atlanta</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Climbing out of a long period of steady decline, this is the latest addition to a growing list of gentrified Atlanta neighborhoods. As is the case elsewhere, the process in East Atlanta is a slow one, and even as a solid collection of shops and restaurants gains a foothold in the blocks around the intersection of Flat Shoals and Glenwood Avenues, most of the surrounding area continues to struggle. One notable out of the way spot is JavaVino, where you can sip wine to slow down and then coffee to speed you back up. Your shopping options represent an interesting mix, while most of the area\''s watering holes cater to the local, blue-collar crowd.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Vinings</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This trendy area has re-invented itself over past few years to become a rather enviable and affluent neighborhood. Sitting at the far northwest corner of the city, the Vinings is largely home to folks who want to live in the city but really don\''t. Following the money, great new restaurants like Canoe are gaining widespread praise as they take their place alongside such re-invented local favorites as the Vinings Inn. Shopping, however, still draws the majority of traffic, mostly to Cumberland Mall at I-75 and Windy Hill Road, but also to the Vinings Jubilee Center, a collection of shops and boutiques developed to resemble a town square.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Constructed in 1870, the Boardwalk was the first of its kind in America and boosted the seaside experience for visitors. With its mesmerizing ocean views and fun attractions, the Boardwalk is an Atlantic City icon. This stretch along the Atlantic Ocean is known for its resort hotels, sandy beaches, and local boutiques. For more information on city\''s accommodations, shopping, restaurants and entertainment, there is a tourist information center at the Boardwalk Hall, more notably the historic landmark where famous events such as the Miss America pageant have taken place.

Its swollen bulk hangs out over the constricting belt of its isthmus and bulges further than the eye can see. Its head cannot locate its toes.\"  Over a quarter of the nation\''s inhabitants live in the Auckland region. Since the Maori alighted from their <em>waka</em> (canoes) to occupy the densely forested land, a steady stream of migrants have followed; Europeans, Asians and Polynesians have all made the journey to create the largest Polynesian enclave in the world. More than 50 volcanoes have erupted in Auckland, permanently scarring its landscape. The last, 600 years ago, gave birth to Rangitoto Island. Today, the buzz, aggression and vitality of the city echoes this turbulent past.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Local alternative bands can be found mostly in places like Neck of the Woods, Orleans and the Ponsonby Social Club. Danny Doolan\''s hosts live music seven nights a week, while the Kings Arms Tavern has been Eden Terrace\''s crowds with some of the best beer and music in town for more than a century.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Auckland War Memorial Museum houses New Zealand\''s largest collection of Maori artifacts, as well as many interactive displays. The real reason to come here is for the unique Maori cultural performance, that includes a traditional dance and stick games. The Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tamaki has an extensive collection of regional art on a regularly rotating schedule. Explore Auckland\''s rich nautical history at the New Zealand National Maritime Museum, which features 14 galleries, fully restored vessels and educational cruises.  The Artis Gallery showcases contemporary paintings, photographs and sculptures. The child-friendly Monterey Park Museum has a vintage car collection and the famed Model World, where visitors can explore miniature replications of famous Auckland landmarks, as well as those of boats and trains.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From international hits to indie gems, Auckland\''s theater scene is ever-expanding. Big touring shows, as well as productions by Auckland Opera and The New Zealand Ballet, can be found at The Aotea Centre. The Auckland Theatre Company offers a superb program of plays at its home venue, the ASB Waterfront Theatre on Halsey Street. Other performing arts venues such as Skycity Theatre, Pumphouse Theater and the Dolphin Theatre also offer a range of robust programs that span dance, comedy acts, theatrical productions and musical performances.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parks and Gardens</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A visit to one of the city\''s many parks and gardens is also a must. One Tree Hill was once a volcano and can be found in Cornwall Park. Eden Garden is nearly four decades old, and has an impressive collection of exotic flowers. Albert Park is close to the University of Auckland and is the location of many local concerts, while Cornwall Park is a quiet sanctuary that is also home to grazing sheep.  You can spend the whole day at Western Springs touring its many lakes and feeding the resident ducks. The elegant Auckland Botanic Gardens is a good place to go if you want to learn more about the city\''s natural side. Check out the ocean views and camping grounds at Tawhitokino Regional Park and Tapapakanga Point.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The events calendar has something for everyone. The Waiheke International Jazz Festival has become a fine Easter tradition, while gardening buffs will love the Ellerslie International Flower Show. The Auckland Arts Festival invites talent from all over the globe, while St Jerome\''s Laneway Festival, the Raggamuffin festival and the Pasifika Festival are all high-octane celebrations of the city and country\''s music and culture.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bars and Nightclubs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Auckland\''s nights come alive at popular spots like Queen Street, where you can stop by at for quiz nights at bars like the Bluestone Room or Habana Joe\''s. This street and its nearby lanes are studded with an exciting glimmer of bars that cater to every kind of entertainment and theme. Of a similar caliber is Viaduct Harbour that packs in a number of beer spots and sports bars like Danny Doolans and Fox\''s Ale House.

Take a cultural stopover at the Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tamaki, the Auckland Town Hall, the Aotea Centre or the Civic.  The main fashion hub is located nearby on High Street, and is home to some of the world\''s hottest new labels. Queen Street eventually converges with the waterfront and the revamped Viaduct Harbour Marina.  A passion for uprooting the past (Auckland was once dubbed the \"City of Cranes\") began with <em>Pakeha</em> (European settlers) removing entire volcanic cones in order to revamp the waterfront. Now it is an essential playground for all. Millions have been spent beautifying Viaduct Harbour Marina, a perfect backdrop for the New Zealand National Maritime Museum, the Ferry Building and a bevy of restaurants and nightspots.  On the inner city fringe lies the infamous Karangahape Road. On the fringe is Grafton, location of Auckland Hospital, the ice-cream colored Starship Children\''s Hospital and Auckland\''s major recreational park—the Auckland Domain, with its sports fields, Wintergardens, duck ponds and the Auckland War Memorial Museum.  South of the Domain, you can fully appreciate the city from the summit of Mount Eden (Maungawhau). Try one of the trendy village cafés nestled at its base. Another volcanic vantage point, offering views to both the Waitemata and Manukau harbors, is One Tree Hill (Maungakiekie). Stargazers will enjoy the Auckland Observatory and Star Dome situated in surrounding Cornwall Park.  West of downtown, you\''ll find Ponsonby--The Strip, a cluster of popular restaurants. Although competition has become fierce with the new waterfront restaurants and bars, many remain loyal to Ponsonby icons such as Prego, and S.P.Q.R</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Newmarket and Parnell</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Heading east, but still hovering on the fringes of the city, are the suburbs of Newmarket and Parnell. Newmarket is a fashion addict\''s delight, and perhaps a smarter, slicker version of Parnell, once the domain of yuppie excess. A more sober past is reflected in historic buildings such as Kinder House and Whitby Lodge, which sit alongside a lively mix of shops and restaurants. Further east along Tamaki Drive is Auckland\''s own Riviera of crescent beaches, stretching from Okahu Bay and Bastion Point to Mission Bay, Kohimarama and Saint Heliers Beach. Along the drive you will find Kelly Tarlton\''s Sea Life Aquarium, more street cafés and seaside playgrounds.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Auckland</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Manukau City, with 50 different ethnic communities, is proudly multicultural. It shows off its Polynesian flair in a cornucopia of markets, festivals, community churches and some of the region\''s most diverse shopping, including Otara Market. For an adrenaline rush, there is Rainbow\''s End theme park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">West Auckland</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">West Auckland offers rugged scenic beauty and, as home to the Dalmatian population, has a unique cultural heritage. To fully appreciate its natural attractions, drive 45 minutes west from the city to the black sand and surf beaches at Piha Beach, Karekare Beach and Muriwai Beach. Also check out the nearby Gannet Colony. For outdoor enthusiasts there are over 140 bushwalks in the Waitakere Ranges, trails for bikes and four wheel drive vehicles, and horse riding opportunities.  There are a number of established family wineries here also, notably Matua Valley, House of Nobilo and Coopers Creek, near Kumeu. Several of the wineries have excellent restaurants--Allely House at Selaks is worth the drive to enjoy the beautiful setting and delicious food.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The North Shore</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Across the Harbour Bridge lies North Shore City and miles of superb beaches. Seaside suburbs with relaxed shopping centers and restaurants wind their way north, with a major highlight being the historic village of Devonport accessible by boat from the Ferry Building. To view some expensive real estate, walk along Takapuna Beach and continue on to Milford Beach along the sea wall at low tide.  Beyond the confines of the city lie the 47 islands of the Hauraki Gulf Maritime Park, including Rangitoto Island and Waiheke Island, which attract many visitors to their idyllic bays and beaches, galleries, vineyards and restaurants, and the annual Waiheke International Jazz Festival.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Art School at Laguna Gloria is also on the grounds, offering classes for children and adults in sculpture, graphic arts, painting, jewelry-making and more.

The museum also presents theatrical, musical and performing arts events on weekends.  Sculptor Elisabet Ney moved to Austin in the late 1800s and built Formosa, her home and studio. This Greek/Gothic building, now the Elisabet Ney Museum, is dedicated to the life and works of the artist. Ney sculpted the figures of Sam Houston and Stephen F. Austin that stand on the Texas State Capitol grounds today.  If it\''s a beautiful day in Austin, you must visit the Umlauf Sculpture Garden & Museum. Charles Umlauf\''s work is showcased here in the outdoor Xeriscape garden, where visitors linger by the pond. This casual setting is home to 62 bronze and cast pieces.To immerse yourself in a bit of history, head to the Bullock Texas State History Museum that ensures a fun time for both adults and kids, while the Harry Ransom Center in the University of Texas boasts of an impressive archival collection of manuscripts and literary artifacts from both United States and Europe.

In the summer, the Symphony performs at Oregon Ridge Park in suburban Cockeysville (Baltimore County). The outdoor venue offers visitors a wonderful opportunity to enjoy great music in a serene atmosphere. Visitors who enjoy opera will love the historic Lyric Opera House, home of the Baltimore Opera Company.

The 13-mile paved trail stretches from suburban Glen Burnie to Annapolis, affording bicyclists, skaters and walkers a respite from the hustle and bustle of Baltimore\''s encroaching suburbs. Hikers will enjoy spending a day at the Earth Treks Climbing Center in Columbia (Howard County). It is the East Coast\''s largest indoor climbing center, featuring a state-of-the-art, 13,250-square-feet (1230.96 square meter) climbing surface that resembles a southwestern canyon with 44-feet (13.41 meter) high cliffs.

The Baltimore Streetcar Museum and B & O Railroad Museum are also worth visiting.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Baltimore\''s nightlife is an apt reflection of the city\''s diversity, the options as varied as the clientele. For live music, Ottobar is the top choice, featuring an eclectic lineup of garage bands alongside more prominent acts. If you\''re feeling nostalgic, head to the legendary Pop\''s Tavern.

 (180,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Inner Harbor</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Any tour of Baltimore should begin at the Inner Harbor. For years the area was at the heart of Baltimore\''s port facilities. As the city\''s shipping business declined in the post-war years, the Inner Harbor did too. By the mid-1970s, it was a long stretch of dilapidated docks and abandoned warehouses, but the end of this decade saw the start of a concerted effort to revitalize Baltimore. A key part of the plan was the creation of Harborplace, a three-acre retail and entertainment complex that anchors the Inner Harbor. Today, the Inner Harbor\''s attractions include the Maryland Science Center, the National Aquarium, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, the U.S.S. Constellation, and the Pier Six Concert Pavilion. In addition, there are a number of excellent hotels, including the four-star Harbor Court, many fine restaurants, and two very busy marinas. The Inner Harbor\''s renovation was vital to Baltimore\''s renaissance, and it remains the highlight of the city\''s tourism industry.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1729, about 60 years after the first colonists settled in the area, Charles and Baltimore streets were built. Today, the intersection of these two roads is at the heart of Baltimore\''s business district, where you\''ll find the city\''s financial and banking institutions, international trade organizations, and medical research companies, as well as law, engineering and architectural firms. A grid of roughly 25 blocks, the business district is easy to navigate and is within walking distance of most of the downtown hotels.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">To the North</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Walk up Charles Street about 10 blocks and you\''ll find Mount Vernon, one of the city\''s loveliest neighborhoods. Its chief feature is a park of shrub-lined lawns and flowerbeds, laid out in the form of a cross. The 178-feet (54.25 meters) tall monument to George Washington stands at the park\''s center. Mount Vernon is also home to the Peabody Institute, the Walters Art Gallery, the Enoch Pratt Free Library and several excellent restaurants, including Tio Pepe. Just above Mount Vernon is Bolton Hill. Known as the \"Gin Belt\" during the 1920s, this area was home to the city\''s Jazz Age bohemian community. F. Scott Fitzgerald made his home here for a while, and <em>Tender is the Night</em> was published during his stay. Today, the area is home to the Maryland Institute College of Art, Meyerhoff Symphony Hall and the University of Baltimore. Further north, lies well-groomed Charles Village, home of Johns Hopkins University. Just next door is Hampden, a funky blue-collar/alternative district made famous by independent film director John Waters. Continue north, and you\''ll find Guilford, which features Mount Washington, a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood with lots of great restaurants.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">To the South</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just south of downtown is Federal Hill. One of the most popular residential areas in the city, its streets are lined with stately 19th Century rowhouses, and peppered with great restaurants like The One World Café. The neighborhood is also home to the Cross Street Market, where a variety of vendors sell a vast array of fresh and prepared food items, and the American Visionary Art Museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">To the East</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Immediately east of downtown is Little Italy, one of the city\''s most cherished neighborhoods. Settled in the 1840s by Italian immigrants seeking work on the city\''s railroads, the area is now known for its many restaurants. At last count, the 12 square blocks of Little Italy had 20 restaurants, from old favorites like Sabatino\''s to more recent additions like Aldo\''s. Just past Little Italy is Fells Point. This was once the chief Colonial shipbuilding center, where frigates known as Baltimore Clippers were launched. Today Fells Point is known for its craft and antique shops, restaurants, bars and coffeehouses. During the weekend, the neighborhood is jammed with college-age revelers who flock to the many party-oriented dance clubs, while young urban professionals enjoy dining at restaurants like Bertha\''s. Just above Fells Point is Butcher\''s Hill, an area once home to dozens of butchers who sold their wares at Fells Point\''s Broadway Market. Farther north is Old Town, a neighborhood settled by German and Irish immigrants in the early 1800s. Just to the east lies Canton. Originally an industrial area populated by Welsh, German, Polish and Irish immigrants, Canton today is a lively residential area known for its friendly eateries like Nacho Mama\''s. To the north of Canton is Greek Town, a quiet residential neighborhood famous for its restaurants, Ikaros foremost among them.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">To the West</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A quick trip west from the Inner Harbor will take you into Pigtown, originally an area of stockyards manned by German and Irish immigrants. It\''s now a residential neighborhood, filled with classic Baltimore-style rowhomes with marble steps and formstone facades. Pigtown is also home to the B & O Railroad Museum, and the area\''s most famous son is memorialized at the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Museum.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Known as <em>khon</em>, these performances involve masked actors portraying heroes, heroines, monkeys and demons from the <em>Ramakian</em> (the Thai version of the Hindu <em>Ramayana</em>). Two of the best places to see <em>khon</em> are the National Theatre and the Chaloem Krung Royal Theatre. In addition, there are many dinner theaters catering largely to tourists, where admission includes dinner and the show. Sala Rim Naam, which is run by the Oriental Hotel, features one of the more extravagant settings of any dinner theater. <em>Lakhon kae bon</em>, a <em>khon</em> variant, can be seen free of charge at the Erawan Shrine and Lak Mueang. These performances are commissioned by worshipers whose wishes have been granted by the deities of these busy city shrines.Also of interest for the theatrically inclined, the Bangkok Playhouse serves as a regular venue for contemporary Thai theater and performance art. Lastly, there are at least two big tourist-friendly cabaret shows worth seeing— Calypso Cabaret at the Asiatique Ferris Wheel, which is the most famous and possibly the best, and Mambo Cabaret on Sukhumvit Road, a relatively newer venue already packed with tourists.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Thai Boxing</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Culture of another sort, though no less incredible, the national sport of <em>muay thai</em> is better known overseas as Thai kick-boxing. Two major stadiums and many smaller ones scattered around Bangkok offer ample opportunities to see <em>muay thai</em>, complete with all its ritual rappings. Lumpini and Ratchadamnoen feature some of the best fighters in the country, with matches alternating between the two stadiums over the course of a week. Apart from the action in the ring, added entertainment is provided by the musical accompaniment played by a traditional ensemble centered around the <em>pii</em>, or Thai oboe, plus the sight of the big, rowdy crowd betting away.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bangkok succumbed to the multiplex revolution several years ago, like other metropolitan cities. Almost every big shopping mall has an attached cineplex showing the latest Hollywood blockbusters as well as some Thai and Thai-dubbed Hong Kong films. In addition, Bangkok hosts at least three big film festivals a year, while the cultural centers of the French, German and Japanese embassies show selected films once a week. Some of Bangkok\''s better cinemas include SF World Cinema at the Central World Plaza and Lido Multiplex in the heart of Siam Square.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theme Parks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whether or not you are traveling with children, there are several big theme parks on the outskirts of Bangkok worth visiting. Dream World, features rides that are a big hit with the kids. If you prefer to cool down, Siam Park City will do just fine. With an enormous wave pool, lots of water slides, whirlpools and other forms of aquatic chaos, it gets crowded with families seeking to escape the heat on the weekends. At Safari World, a drive-through wildlife park, you can observe a teeming array of animals through the windows of your car or tour bus.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums, Galleries & Libraries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bangkok\''s many museums, galleries and libraries present an oasis of solitude in an otherwise hectic city. The National Museum displays Thailand\''s cultural treasures, and offers excellent guided tours. On the gallery front, the National Gallery will certainly interest pure art fans. The Neilson Hayes Library in downtown Bangkok houses what is possibly Bangkok\''s best collection of English literature in a stunning 1930s era building. A visit to Bangkok Children\''s Discovery Museum will please any child. Explore traditional Thai culture at the Kamthieng House or Vimanmek Museum. The National Science Museum has rotating hands-on exhibits.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Massage/Meditation</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If all this activity leaves you completely drained, what better way is there to revive your spirits than with a traditional Thai massage? Nowadays, particularly in tourist areas, there is a plethora of reflexology and massage parlors, but you probably get the best value for your money at Wat Pho, Bangkok\''s oldest Buddhist temple. Meditation courses also represent a good way to experience a different side of Bangkok. For non-Thai speakers, Wat Mahathat and Wat Pak Nam, both of which have many foreign students, are probably the best places to visit.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bars and Nightclubs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bangkok is swarming with bars and clubs of all kinds and types, from traditional dive-style bars and glitzy rooftop haunts, to themed bars and more. While the bar scene in the city is certainly overwhelming, some establishments lie higher up on the hierarchy than others. If you\''re looking to unwind at one of Bangkok\''s upscale bars, then swish drinking institutions like the Bamboo Bar, and the Q&A Bar, a stylish speakeasy in Watthana will not fail you. Smalls, an intimate yet casual bar in Sathorn boasts of a lovely ambiance and absinthe offerings, and stays open until 2a. Cocktail lovers should head to the Backstage Cocktail Bar, a fine hidden gem in the Playhaus Thonglor Boutique Hotel. The Vesper, also known for its potent cocktails, is located on Convent Road and offers great happy hour deals. Bangkok is also known for its huge repertoire of rooftop and garden bars that offer fantastic views over the dazzling city. Clubbing enthusiasts will find true party paradise on Royal City Avenue, which is teeming with a brilliant array of clubs that jostle for space next to one another. From landmark party spots like Route 66, to Onyx, a sprawling nightclub known for its hypnotic EDM parties, this street is the perfect way to enjoy a night in the city. At Khao San Road, backpacker clubs rule the roost, as do local club spots, while Thonglor Soi 10 is lined with swanky bars and clubs that attract some of the most well-dressed in town. When speaking of Bangkok\''s party circuit, it would be a grave neglect to not mention the Soi 11, where its warren of seedy watering holes and neon-lit corners are its main claim to fame. Silom Road, similar in appearance, also glitters all through the night with a blinding cornucopia of bars and clubs.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In a city filled to the brim with bargains, it is hard to escape the world of shopping in Bangkok. From the vibrant Chatuchak Weekend Market that specializes in Thai handicrafts, to massive malls such as the MBK, CentralWorld, Platinum Fashion Mall and Pantip Plaza that offer everything under the sun, Bangkok really is a shoppers\'' delight. Other famous markets here include the Rot Fai Train Night Market and the Pratunam Market.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Here you will find fantastic examples of historical architecture such as the glittering Grand Palace, Wat Phra Keo, Wat Pho, Wat Mahathat, the Golden Mount and Wat Suthat. The city\''s founding pillar, Lak Mueang, is also located in this district, as are the National Museum, National Theater and National Gallery. If you are keen on seeing something completely out of the ordinary, pop across the river to the Siriraj Medical Museum. Sanam Luang is about the only green spot on the \"island,\" which is not really an island but would have seemed like one in the old days before the many canals linking the area to the river had not yet been filled in.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Thonburi</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bangkok was once referred to as \"The Venice of the East,\" but today the <em>klongs</em>, or canals, are concentrated in Thonburi, an area lying to the west of the Chao Phraya River. You can take a <em>klong</em> tour, typical stops include Wat Arun and the museum of the Royal Barges. Buses heading south from Bangkok leave from Sai Tai bus terminal, located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Banglampoo & Thewet</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Backpackers head for the Banglampoo and Thewet districts. Near the Democracy Monument on Khao San Road you can find some good souvenir shopping. This strip is lined with guest houses and cheap restaurants, none of which stand out for their ambiance or cuisine. A mere stone\''s throw away along Phra Arthit Road, some great restaurants and bars come to life at night. Following the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya, you will come to an area with a laid-back, cosmopolitan feel that is frequented by students from the nearby universities of Thammasat and Silpakorn.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dusit</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Dusit district offers plenty of tourist attractions. Vimanmek Palace, Wat Benchamabophit, Suan Pakkard Palace and Dusit Zoo are all found here. There is not much in the way of hotels or restaurants, but a small artsy area popular with local students has sprung up on Rachawithee Soi 34.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Phayathai/Chatuchak</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Northern Bangkok\''s touristic highlight is Chatuchak Weekend Market, best reached by catching the Skytrain. Mor Chit bus terminal is located near the same stop, which is handy to know if you want to catch an inter-provincial bus heading north or northeast. This is also a major transport hub, with the Skytrain and plenty of buses passing through. Mah Boon Krong is the largest shopping center in the district, and serves as a local transit hub and good orientation point.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pathumwan</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Young Thais and keen shoppers typically head for the area around Siam Square, a shopping paradise. The huge array of dining options along this stretch include the Ban Khun Mae Restaurant and the Erawan Tea Room.There is plenty of selection in malls such as Siam Center and Siam Discovery Center, and the CentralWorld shopping complex. A walk away from the latter stands Pantip Plaza, also known as heaven for computer geeks, and possibly the best place to get deals on computers in Southeast Asia. The non-shopper can retreat to the sanctuary of Jim Thompson\''s House and Museum. There is a cluster of hotels in this area, and popular restaurants such as the Hard Rock Café are also found here. Heading east along Ploenchit Road and Sukhumvit Road, you can orchestrate a shopping extravaganza at either the street stalls that spring up at the beginning of Sukhumvit and stretch to Soi Asoke, or at department stores such as Central Chidlom.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sathorn/Silom/Bangrak</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Sathorn/Silom area forms the core of Bangkok\''s Central Business District, although the Stock Exchange of Thailand is located some distance away on Ratchadaphisek Road. The area encompasses a number of embassies and hotels, such as the Sukhothai and Dusit Thani. Silom Road offers more shopping opportunities, including the Patpong Night Market. Sri Maha Uma Devi Temple is also located in this district. Restaurants abound, particularly around Convent Road. Head for nearby Lumpini Park for a break in a rare patch of green.If you head west along Sathorn or Silom Road, you will come to Charoen Krung (\"New\") Road and back to the Chao Phraya River. A tram used to run along this road, but these days hardly anything does - the traffic is too thick. This is another popular hotel area, with such luxurious hotels as The Oriental, The Peninsula, the Shangri-La, the Royal Orchid Sheraton and the Marriott Spa Resort all overlooking the river. Take a sunset cruise or dine in one of the many restaurants along the majestic river, such as Yok Yor Marina and Restaurant. The River City Shopping Complex sells a huge array of antiques and is worth a browse.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chinatown & Pahurat</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">North along the river lies hectic Chinatown and Pahurat, an Indian district. Here you will find Wat Traimit, but the area is best known for its shopping. Yaowarat Road has loads of gold shops, while Sampeng Lane has everything from hair accessories to shoes, all at bargain prices. Farther north you will come to Pak Klong Talat with its colorful fresh flowers.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outside the City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are also a number of attractions to be found in the outlying areas of Bangkok and adjacent provinces, including King Rama IX Royal Park, Nonthaburi, the Ancient City, Damnoen Saduak Floating Market and Ayutthaya, a trip to which usually incorporates a visit to Bang Pa-In Summer Palace.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Nearby, you\''ll find galleries devoted to individual artists, including Museu Picasso, Fundació Miró and Antoni Tàpies. The Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona is a prime hub for the city\''s artistic and cultural pursuits, and is a fantastic repository of contemporary art.

Museo Picasso is also another outstanding establishment that dazzles with one of the most comprehensive collections of the artworks of the Spanish master of Expressionism, Pablo Picasso. While the Casa Milà may appear rather jarring in its stark modernist appearance, Gaudí lovers will immediately recognize and love its unique architecture. Considered to be the last private residence designed by the architect, this structure is also known as \''open quarry\'', and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Other local museums such as the Museu Marítim illustrate the once-thriving seafaring heritage of the city that transpired between the 13th and 18th centuries, and the captivating Design Museum of Barcelona, shaped like a giant stapler, recounts its fierce connection with the world of design.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Architecture</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To see the best examples of Catalonia\''s unique Gothic architecture, you should check out Basílica de Santa María del Mar and Basílica de Santa María del Pi. For the best in modernist architecture, head for Pedrera, Casa Batlló, Sagrada Familia, and Parc Güell.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife and Live Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most popular nightclubs are within walking distance of each other down by the harbor area, in Port Olímpic and Maremàgnum. The variety is endless. You\''ll find places playing techno, salsa, rock, Spanish pop music and more. Karma is a popular club in this area. Moog, a decades-old music venue is currently at the forefront of the techno and electro music culture, and is open all throughout the year. Others like the Macarena Club are considered to be among Barcelona\''s most eminent party destinations, as are Opium, Pacha, and Sala Apolo, which also doubles up as a concert hall. The Marula Café has a more laidback vibe, and is a fantastic hangout for jazz and blues live music, and the Jamboree Jazz Club hosts similar events.

The National Theatre of Catalonia nearby is home to three theater venues that hosts varying Catalan productions throughout the year. When speaking of theaters, one cannot miss the splendor of the Liceu, Barcelona\''s treasured opera house. The heritage Coliseum, located on Gran Via is famous not only for its rich music program, but also for its brilliant architecture. Other notable theaters that offer a multitude of classical and high-rated programs include the Teatre Tivoli, El Molino and Sala Beckett, a city favorite for independent theatrical productions.  For more traditional performances, longstanding prestigious venues like the Tablao Flamenco Cordobes, the Tablao de Carmen, and Los Tarantos are most visited.

The Festival del Grec in July is a splendid cultural festival, as is the Festival Cruïlla Barcelona, a music festival that spans several contemporary music genres, and welcomes a wealth of international and local bands to perform. The Barcelona Carnival enlivens the streets of Barcelona, as an army of parades and floats take the city by storm toward the end of February. Barcelona also hosts a number of film festivals, including the Sala Montjuïc outdoor film festival and the Gandules outdoor film festival.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Barcelona\''s fashionable streets are thick with shops, malls and shopping zones of all sizes and types. While streets like Passeig de Gracia and Carrer de la Portaferrissa are famous for wonderful finds, others such as the pedestrianized Portal de l\''Àngel is an underrated shoppers paradise as well. At Avinguda Diagonal, the dazzle of international brands and designer stores will leave you spellbound, while the charm of Plaça de Sant Josep Oriol is inherently tied to its local boutique stores and artisanal shops.

 (209,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Old Town</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Barcelona\''s old town, or <em>Ciutat Vella</em>, is the heart of the city. It\''s made up of many small neighborhoods, full of old-world character, linked by narrow, winding streets. Students, foreigners and artists thrive in this area, attracted by its sense of history and cosmopolitan feel along with its trendy bars, concert halls and good restaurants.  Start your tour from Plaça Catalunya and take Les Rambles towards the sea. On the right, you\''ll find the Raval district with its museums, art galleries and notorious red-light area, <em>Barri Xines</em>. On your left, the medieval Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter) is home to the cathedral, the peaceful Plaça del Pi, art galleries and lots of cafés serving delicious hot chocolate. If you go even further left, across busy Via Laietana, you\''ll come to Born Market, in La Ribera district. This trendy neighborhood is also home to the graceful Santa Maria del Mar Church and the impressive Museu Picasso.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">L\''eixample</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When the old town became overpopulated in the mid-19th Century, the city expanded inland, north of Plaça Catalunya. The streets of the new suburb, called L\''eixample (The Extension) were laid out in a grid pattern. Catalan <em>modernista</em> (Art Nouveau) architects designed a number of striking buildings in the area around Passeig de Gràcia and Rambla Catalunya. You\''ll find the extraordinary Sagrada Familia on the right-hand side of L\''eixample if you\''re coming from the Old Town. This controversial church, unfinished because of the untimely death of its architect, Antoni Gaudí, in 1926, has become the city\''s most visited monument. As Barcelona expanded further north, more new neighborhoods were built. Villages were absorbed within the city boundaries giving rise to districts like the charming Gràcia, Les Corts, Sarrià and Hortà-Guinardò, up in the hills. The working-class neighborhood of Sants marks the city\''s southern boundary and has excellent public transport to the center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Green Areas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Montjüic Hill, in the southwest of the city, offers many attractions including the Olympic Stadium and other facilities used for the 1992 Olympic Games, along with the impressive Fundació Miró. The best way to get to the hill is to take the cable car from the nearby harbor. Barcelona\''s other major green area is the 1800-foot (549-meter) Tibidabo Hill to the northwest, with its panoramic views of the city, amusement park on the summit and Torre de Comunicaciones de Collserola (Collserola Communications Tower).  Both Montjüic and Tibidabo offer good sports facilities as well, like tennis, jogging, and horseback riding. It\''s easiest to get there by car, though you could also take the cable car to Montjüic. The cable car also offers a great view of the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Seaside</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The mild Mediterranean climate and calm seas mean you can sail and windsurf all year round from Port Olímpic (Olympic Port). Little boats (<em>golondrinas</em>) leaving from the harbor will take you on a sightseeing tour of the city\''s waterfront and nearby coastline. The fishing district of Barceloneta offers excellent seafood restaurants. Ultra-modern Maremagnum has busy bars with outdoor terraces, discos, shops and cinemas. You\''ll also find trendy open-air music bars in Port Olímpic in the summer. Half an hour\''s journey to the south, Sitges\'' pretty beaches attract a cosmopolitan crowd. For more peaceful surroundings, head north to one of Costa Brava\''s deserted coves.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sant Adrià de Besòs - El Fòrum</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Constructed and remodeled to host the Fòrum de Les Cultures in 2004, this area located to the north of the city has bloomed as a cultural center.

It is characterized by long, wide boulevards and a labyrinthine network of overpasses and freeways that comprises six ring roads. Fortunately, there is order in the chaos. At the heart of Beijing lies the Forbidden City, the absolute center of the capital, from where the ring roads emanate in concentric circles. First Ring Road surrounds the former imperial complex and land that is now mostly parks and museums. More important to travelers is navigating the Second and Third Ring Roads. Second Ring Road was built where Beijing\''s ancient city walls once stood, and the old city is comprised within, including the districts of Dong Cheng, Xi Cheng, Chong Wen and Xuan Wu. The area within Third Ring Road is also considered the center of the town where the most concentrated portion of public transit exists, including Chao Yang and Hai Dian districts. The fourth, fifth and sixth rings are useful for commuting to the airport, university and technology districts, and outlying suburbs.  There are 16 urban districts and two rural counties in Beijing municipality proper, with each district containing distinctive neighborhoods. Most areas of interest are in the eastern Chao Yang and central Dong Cheng and Xi Cheng districts. Dong Cheng District With Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, and Mao\''s Mausoleum within its boundaries, this district is one of the most visited places in Beijing. Not surprisingly, major hotels such as the Grand Hotel Beijing are found here. Dong Cheng is the district where many of Beijing\''s distinctive neighborhoods are found, including Wang Fu Jing Shopping District, the area surrounding the Drum Tower and Yong He Gong Lama Temple.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Internationally recognized Ullens Center for Contemporary Art has regular exhibitions. Photography buffs should check out the Three Shadows Art Centre, the first gallery in China exclusively devoted to photography.

Dangdai International Art Festival is also held in the fall and features a new theme each year. Closer to the center of town are BANG Beijing Art Now Gallery and Red Gate Gallery. For a pleasant day trip visit the Song Zhuang Art Community\''s Artists Village Gallery.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Designed to expose foreigners to Chinese cinema, Cherry Lane Movies features Chinese films subtitled in English. Alternatively, why not join an eclectic audience at the Sculpting In Time Cafe and catch a subtitled foreign film on movie nights. If you are willing to stray from the city center, you can also visit the China National Film Museum. This enormous 63-acre (25-hectare) museum is truly a film buffs fantasy, featuring 20 permanent collections and 1,500 films.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dance</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city of Beijing has played host to various international dance troupes such as the Joffrey Ballet.

For the ultimate history lesson, though, venture over to the Forbidden City where the Palace Museum resides. Once the home of the emperors, this gigantic museum is the largest in China, featuring a collection so vast that it cannot all be seen in one day. The National Museum of Modern Chinese Literature houses folios, manuscripts and photographs in a variety of languages and holds regular exhibitions. The Beijing World Art Museum houses a fantastic old and new technology collection and some black and white Picasso prints.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Classical music concerts are held at various locations in Beijing. The most impressive auditorium is the Beijing Concert Hall which seats up to 1,000 people. The upscale Century Theater is another major venue for a classical music fix. Various hotels across the city, such as the Palace Hotel and Jianguo Hotel also host soothing musical performances. For a taste of local culture, try the San Wei Bookstore and enjoy traditional Chinese music played with such instruments as the <em>erhu</em> and <em>pipa</em>. Cultural complex Imperial Granary has transformed a district of ancient buildings into concert and theater space that is often used for small non-traditional music and performance art.

This is a loosely designated area of bars and pubs with San Li Tun North and South Streets at its heart. With the reconstruction efforts for the Olympics, the actual street and its many fabulous bars and restaurants have shifted, much to the confusion of return visitors to Beijing.

Central to Da Shan Zi is 798 Space where events, fashion shows, and exhibitions are often held. If you are in Beijing in October, they also host the most outstanding Halloween party in town. The former factory grounds are open to the public free of charge and offers a campus-like feeling of quiet tree lined paths, creative whimsy and plenty of galleries to see artistic history in the making.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Xicheng District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Xicheng covers a great deal of the old city. It is just west of the Forbidden City and epitomizes the blending of an old and new China. Once the home of wealthy merchants and people loosely associated with the court, it is now considered the cultural, historical, business, financial, and political district of Beijing. The financial and commercial districts, centered at Jinrong Jie, are located here. For the ultimate experience of Old Beijing visit Bei Hai, Beijing\''s oldest park, dating back to the 10th century.

For good drinks and music visit the East Shore Live Jazz Cafe or the Buddha Bar.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chong Wen District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Located in the south of the city, this is a long-established commercial area, selling everything from eyeglasses to sporting goods.

Mainly an industrial area, there are several cultural and historical sites worth visiting, such as the Beijing Air and Space Museum, Feng Tai Park and Marco Polo Bridge.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hai Dian District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This northwestern part of the city is also known as the university district. Along with Beijing University and Qinghua University, who compete to be China\''s top school, there are ten major national universities within a four mile (6.43 kilometer) radius here. Owing to the young student population, this area has a reputation for being hip and full of cheap eats and dive bars.

It\''s a lavish Victorian edifice and the signature building of the Golden Mile. The Opera House is a vibrant arts venue, attracting reputable companies from England touring with ex-West-end productions, musicals, ballet companies from around the world and our own opera companies. A pantomime every Christmas is a highlight of the season. The Opera House, however, is now outshone by the magnificent Waterfront Hall, Belfast\''s modern arts emporium. One of the first of several dazzling buildings to spring up around the area of the old Belfast docks, the Waterfront Hall is dazzling at night. Like the Opera House, the Waterfront\''s splendid auditorium and the smaller NTL Studio host a variety of performances, from classical concerts and Shakespearean drama to ballet, pantomime, art and photographic exhibitions, children\''s concerts and stand-up comedy. Belfast is a strong theatre city. The Lyric Theatre hosts our local professional theatre group. Classical, Irish and contemporary drama fills an exciting season. This was the company where Liam Neeson began his career in the late 1970s. The Lyric has consistently supported Irish dramatists and its particular strength is the staging of classic Irish drama. By contrast, the Group Theatre is a showcase for local amateur talent - often humorous. Free classical concerts are hosted by the BBC, normally held in the Waterfront Hall. Belfast\''s own favorite sons, James Galway and Van-the-Man Morrison, will always fill the Waterfront. Popular music, rock and folk are available every night of the week in the pubs of Belfast. If you\''re interested in catching some live music, of the pop or folk variety, pick up a free copy of the Big List - available at most coffee shops - an evening-by-evening guide to what\''s on around the city. Particular venues to note are the Empire and the Limelight, where it is possible to catch acts such as Nils Lofgren, Bert Jansch and other new groups just before they hit the big-time. Oasis were on stage at the Limelight on the night of their first UK number one and it is this venue in particular that continues to attract some of the best up and coming names on the British music scene. Clubs such as Thompson\''s Garage cater everything from 70s disco to house and hip-hop. In spite of Ian Paisley\''s \"Save Ulster from Sodomy\" campaign, there is a growing gay scene in Belfast centered around such clubs as the Kremlin. High-quality arts festivals are frequently in and around Belfast. Three notable ones are the West Belfast Festival in August, which celebrates Irish and nationalist culture; the Belfast Festival at Queen\''s, a truly international festival of the arts attracting performers from around the globe and ranking second only to Edinburgh as the largest festival in the United Kingdom; and its younger rival, the Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival, a celebration of all things avant-garde, going from strength to strength.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The biggest museum in the city is the Ulster Museum, situated inside the beautiful Botanic Gardens near Queen\''s University. The building itself is an enormous multi-floored granite structure crammed full of treasures. Exhibitions are put on for all age groups. Highlights are Irish history and a special collection of coins and artifacts salvaged from the wreck of a ship belonging to the Spanish Armada. The top floor consists of significant gallery space: the Ulster Museum has one of the greatest collections of Irish art in the country. If modern Irish art interests you, there are also plenty of small art galleries dotted around the university district, such as the Fenderesky Gallery and the Bell Gallery.Ten minutes out of the city center will bring you to the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, home to Ireland\''s largest transport collection and to a reconstructed rural Ulster townland from the 19th century.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Children</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\''ve traveled to Belfast with children and the museum trail is driving them crazy, there are plenty of activities around the city that will keep the kids smiling. The Odyssey Complex is Ireland\''s largest entertainment complex, and inside you\''ll find an enormous Imax cinema, one of the biggest in the world. Within the Odyssey, there\''s also an exciting interactive learning center for kids called W5 that will delight <em>them</em> and leave <em>you</em> completely exhausted!  Belfast Zoo is huge, entertaining and lots of fun. If the tigers, lions, elephants and giraffes are leaving your toddler cold, there\''s a mini-farmyard and an excellent playground, with plenty of ice-cream vendors to keep pace with the fun. Ice skating is a popular choice for children of all ages and the Dundonald International Ice Bowl in the east of the city is Ireland\''s largest covered skating rink. If you were thinking more in lines of a simple swim, there are many publicly funded, reasonably-priced leisure centers throughout the city, including the Valley Leisure Centre in the north and Avoniel Leisure Centre in the east. The Valley Leisure Centre has a water slide and a smaller pool for babies and toddlers, and hosts a vast range of activities for children of all ages, from its \"Tumble Tots\" club to judo.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Regional Attractions</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Continue your journey out of the city limits and there\''s plenty to see and do around Co. Down. A tour around Strangford, an inland slough home to an abundance of wildlife, will take you to Mount Stewart House, Castle Espie, the Exploris Aquarium and Castle Ward, as well as through some of the lushest countrysides in Northern Ireland. A drive around the island-dotted waters of the Ards Penninsula can be staggeringly lovely in summer. Co. Antrim is more rugged but also boasts a plethora of attractions and a wild coastline. Visit the best preserved Norman structure in Ireland, Carrickfergus Castle. There\''s an accessible cliff walk further round the coast at Whitehead; follow the coast road and it will take you to Glenariff Forest Park, the pretty National Trust village of Cushendun and eventually the Carrick-A-Rede Rope Bridge - Northern Ireland\''s scariest visitor attraction!</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (238,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Shopping District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In front of the City Hall lies the main shopping district. This part of the city centre is very compact and can easily be ranged on foot. Donegall Place and Royal Avenue run down from the City Hall, and the shopping area stretches out to Victoria Street in the east, King Street in the west and up to North Street in the north. The glass-roofed Castlecourt shopping centre on Royal Avenue, complete with fountains and cafes, is the largest covered shopping area in the city, and there are a number of other smaller arcades in the surrounding side streets. Best of these is Queen\''s Arcade, with its vast range of specialist shops.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Entries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The little alleyways that run between Ann Street and High Street are known as the Entries. Tucked away here you\''ll find many an old saloon, such as White\''s Tavern, which claims to be the oldest pub in Belfast. The Entries adjoin the Cathedral Quarter around St Anne\''s Cathedral. This district of the city has seen considerable refurbishment in recent years and is now home to many new apartments, cafes and bars. The Cathedral Quarter was designed as Belfast\''s equivalent to Temple Bar in Dublin, and the development of this arts and entertainment centre in Belfast is one of the most exciting phenomena the city has seen in recent years.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Golden Mile</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the south of the City Hall is Great Victoria Street, which runs up to the university area and is often referred to as the Golden Mile. This district is home to the city\''s largest concentration of restaurants, bars and cafes. Along the Golden Mile you\''ll find the Grand Opera House and the splendid Crown Liquor Saloon, which is owned by the National Trust. Both sumptuously Victorian, they offer significantly different forms of entertainment! Many restaurants and cafes line Great Victoria Street, together with the Europa Hotel, which had for many years the unenvied reputation of being the most bombed hotel in Europe. However it is now shaking off that dubious distinction and has currently expanded into Northern Ireland\''s largest hotel, a symbol of renewed confidence in the city itself.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The University District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Golden Mile leads to the neighbourhood of Queen\''s University, characterised by its plethora of pubs, clubs and places to stay. This is one of the most attractive districts in the city: take an hour to stroll around the well-tended grounds and pleasant red-brick quadrangle of the university. Next door are the Botanic Gardens, which provide a tranquil, peaceful spot for a picnic; the Palm House in the gardens is a relative of the great glasshouses at Kew and the Botanic Gardens in Dublin. The Botanic Gardens are also home to the impressive Ulster Museum (complete with dinosaur exhibits), which is certainly a fine place to while away an afternoon. The Stranmillis Village area is about ten minutes walk away: full of small shops, restaurants and cafes, it is a most pleasant spot for lunch and an excellent refuge from the city within the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The East</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the east of the City Hall is the mouth of the Lagan river. This area has seen lavish investment in recent years, and along the waterfront there are many places to enjoy the river. The Waterfront Hall is Belfast\''s new pride and joy. Even if you don\''t have time to take in a concert, stop for coffee and have a look at the splendid auditorium. Further along, the Lagan Lookout affords excellent views of the two great cranes - David and Goliath - of the Harland & Wolff shipyards. This is where you can get a feel for the industries upon which modern Belfast was founded. And let\''s not forget the most recent and biggest addition to the Belfast waterfront skyline, the Odyssey Arena, which was opened in 2000 and comprises one of the world\''s largest entertainment complexes.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The West</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">West Belfast is where the sectarian divisions of the city are most starkly displayed. The Protestant neighborhoods are clearly demarcated from the Catholic areas; the main route through the Protestant area is the Shankill Road and the Catholic equivalent is the Falls Road. With moves towards peace, West Belfast is by no means a no-go area, but tact and awareness should be at the forefront of any exploration. Visitors should also remember, however, that there are probably rougher areas in their own cities and that West Belfast, despite sectarianism, is just another inner-city area attempting to rejuvenate itself. Petty crime has been all but unknown in Belfast and throughout Northern Ireland through the long years of the \"Troubles\"—a statistic that says more about the culture of the Province than any newspaper headline.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The North</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Cave Hill dominates the northern backdrop of the city, looking down on it as P.J. O\''rourke described it, \"like some kind of Caledonian Sugar Loaf Mountain\". Look out for the feature known as Napoleon\''s Nose, resembling as it does a man lying down with his nose pointing upwards. It is believed that Jonathan Swift was inspired by this sight in his description of Gulliver lying on his back when he first arrives in Lilliput. Belfast Castle nestles on the slopes of the hill, but climb to the top for excellent views over Belfast, the surrounding countryside, the Irish Sea and (on a clear day) Scotland.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beyond the City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Co. Antrim</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">: North of the city, the impressive Norman citadel of Carrickfergus Castle guards the mouth of Belfast Lough. The Antrim coast road runs through some of Ireland\''s most spectacular scenery. The road leads to the pretty resort town of Ballycastle. Regular ferries ply the route between Ballycastle and Rathlin Island, the only inhabited island off the Northern Irish coast. West of Ballycastle, the rope bridge at Carrick-a-Rede attracts many lovers of vertigo! Co. Down : The southern coast of Belfast is gentler, more serene, and contains a wealth of attractions. The seaside resort of Bangor makes for a pleasant day trip when the sun is shining, and just south of Bangor lie the beaches and green landscapes of the Ards peninsula, home to many fishing villages and fine seafood restaurants. The peninsula shelters the island-studded waters of Strangford Lough, one of the most important wildlife refuges in Ireland. The great National Trust properties of Castle Ward and Mount Stewart can be reached from the peninsula. Also in the region is Downpatrick, the resting place of Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Once the historical capital of its country, the shift in power from Belize City to the neighboring Belmopan has hardly diluted its colorful character. This is evident from its bustling streets that demand attention, its flamboyant Caribbean culture, riveting seascapes and stunning colonial architecture. Despite being subject to nature\''s wrath in the form of Hurricane Hattie in 1961, the city has displayed incredible resilience by jumping back to its feet and resuming life the only way it knows - with full force and abandon.

 (248,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fort George</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Its proximity to the Caribbean Sea makes Fort George one of the most handsome and affluent neighborhoods in the city. This is where the city\''s most luxurious hotels and resorts are located, alongside privately owned colonial houses that manage to attract a second look each time you pass them. You will also find some hint of nightlife in this part of the city, with a number of hotel bars and lounges located steps away from each other. Fort George is home to the city\''s picturesque promenade overlooking the dreamy waters of the Caribbean, as also to the historic Baron Bliss Lighthouse located on the far eastern tip of the city. Other attractions in the Fort George neighborhood include Memorial Park and the Belize Tourism Village.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Old Town/Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Not to be confused with the Old Belize park that lies outside the city, Belize City\''s Old Town forms the heart of this frenzied city. The city\''s major museums - the Maritime Museum and the Museum of Belize are located here. The city center is also home to local vendors and small businesses.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">New Town Barracks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Also located on the north side of the city, this street runs parallel to the Caribbean Sea, providing calming vistas of the ocean. A few public parks are also located on the seaside promenade that comprises of a handful of restaurants and bars.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Financial District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The other side of the bridge lives in a more down-to-earth dimension compared to its affluent northern counterpart, mainly consisting of offices, banks, and a few budget accommodations for travelers on a shoestring budget. On the sightseeing front, there is quite a bit to explore around in this neighborhood, with the Supreme Court, the Battlefield Park, the Government House and St John\''s Cathedral, all situated in close proximity to one another.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outlying Areas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Providing a nice break from the chaotic pace of Belize City are the small islands of Caye Caulker and Ambergris Caye, located off the Caribbean coast. Day trips from Belize City are possible to these towns via the San Pedro Ferry. Here, visitors will find ample opportunity to kick back and relax with a cocktail. These islands also provide easy accessibility to the Belize Barrier Reefs, inviting snorkeling opportunities. Other activities include sailing, kayaking, scuba diving and manatee-spotting.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (261,'<div class=\"OverviewText\">Berlin is a city of history and energy, full of excitement and forever evolving. Perhaps the latter point is the most poignant. The old and new German capital is in a constant state of flux, always becoming something without having ever achieved a state of simply being. This phenomenon has accelerated since the fall of the Wall, and efforts are now concentrated on Berlin as an international metropolis. For the past several decades, Berlin has been undergoing major rebuilding and planning efforts, which are visible in the cityscape around Potsdamer Platz and the eastern city center. But there is also a rebuilding process taking place less visibly - in the hearts and minds of Berliners. The city is made up of 23 different districts, each with its own unique character. The following summary will help to give you an overview of this fascinating city and provide you with a guide to what you can do in each particular district and what you can expect to find there.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (267,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Berlin boasts over 100 cinemas, from ultra-modern multi-screen complexes to traditional film theaters. A particularly atmospheric establishment is the Soviet-style Kino International on Karl-Marx-Allee. For more obscure films try the Acud Kino, where you won\''t be disturbed by hundreds of popcorn-junkies. And don\''t worry if your German isn\''t up to par, as places like the Odeon and Babylon Kino feature the latest flicks for English speakers, whereas the Cinéma Paris features movies for the French crowd.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cabaret</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Berlin is world renowned for its cabaret, from the legendary Distel to the Chamäleon\''s late night shows. Charlottenburg also has plenty to offer, with its traditional Wühlmäuse, <em>Stachelschweine</em> and the more comedy-oriented Bar jeder Vernunft.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater in Berlin can mean a lot of different things, from as controversial contemporary Anglo-American drama to a light comedy with mass appeal on Ku\''damm at Komödie & Theater am Kurfürstendamm. While the director heckles the audience at the Volksbühne am Rosa Luxemburg Platz, the Berliner Ensemble reinterprets Brecht. International avant-garde dance troupes step it up at the Hebbel Theater, acrobats and magicians put a spell on the Wintergarten, while the Grips-Theater interacts with its young audience. Anglophiles should check out the English Theater Berlin.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Berlin is a great place for music lovers. Even though David Bowie and Iggy Pop are long gone, Marilyn Manson is still said to enjoy some absinth around the corner. Top addresses include Kreuzberg\''s Junction Bar for jazz, the Sage Club for Afro-beats and hip-hop and the SO 36 for alternative/punk/rock. Big gigs take place at the Arena and Columbiahalle. Classical aficionados have to make the painful choice between three opera houses - or simply head straight to the Philharmonie to listen to the world-famous Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Alternative Culture</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">All of the above too middle-of-the-road for you? Check out the innumerable centers of alternative culture that Berlin is famous for. The UFA-Fabrik, for example, is the place to be in summer, while the Kulturbrauerei is good for alternative theater, art and concerts. A kaleidoscope of modern Chinese art, salsa parties or readings by writers from developing countries are on the agenda at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Clubs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\''s getting late and you want to move your dancing feet? The clubs around Rosenthaler Platz have the remedy! Some are tucked away in backyards and have irregular opening hours, others are hard to find for lack of a name over the door, but all are open until dawn. For techno, head to Friedrichshain\''s exclusive Berghain or to Tresor on Köpenicker Straße. The split-level Watergate Club hosts internationally renowned DJs all year.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parks, Forests & Lakes</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Berlin is a city full of green oases, like Volkspark Friedrichshain and Volkspark Humboldthain, Hasenheide and Jungfernheide, Rehberge and Britzer Gardens. Berlin\''s many rivers and canals - such as the beautiful Landwehr Canal are flanked on both sides by broad, leafy parks and meander through the city like ribbons of green and blue. The icing on the cake is the wonderful variety of lakes and forests in the suburbs. Joggers and horseback-riders share places like the Grunewald Forest, Lake Schlachtensee, and the Krumme Lanke. Also very popular are Tegeler Forest, Tegeler See and the Müggelsee with wild boar, foxes and deer. Indeed, you would hardly ever need to leave the city limits - if it weren\''t for even more idyllic lakes and forests in the surrounding region of Brandenburg.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (268,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mitte</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Let\''s begin in Mitte, Berlin\''s most central district which literally means \"the center.\" The site of the first settlement in the Middle Ages, Mitte contains some of the city\''s oldest buildings such as Marienkirche and Nikolaikirche in the Nikolaiviertel, as well as many of Berlin\''s grandest buildings, strung out like pearls along the magnificent boulevard Unter den Linden. Stretching from Museum Island with the Alte Nationalgalerie and the Pergamon Museum past the imposing Berliner Dom and the lovely fountains and evergreens of the Lustgarten, past the splendid Kronprinzenpalais, Humboldt University and the State Opera House, the historic boulevard is crowned by the emblem of the old and new capital - the Brandenburg Gate.Although it contains many of Berlin\''s architectural showpieces, Mitte is also an urban mishmash full of holes, imperfections and blemishes. The site of the former Royal Palace (pulled down in the 1950s) is now a rather open space, dominated by one of Berlin\''s ubiquitous construction sites. The TV Tower on Alexanderplatz is one of the city center\''s few remaining symbols of the GDR era. Mitte was once scattered with drab socialist high-rises. Many of these have now been replaced by capitalist temples of consumerism, such as the futuristic glass department store Galeries Lafayette on Friedrichstraße. A stone\''s throw north of the River Spree, the face of Mitte changes once again. This is the Mitte of bars, restaurants, cafés and clubs - the heart of Berlin\''s buzzing nightlife scene. It is also the district of alternative galleries and artistic experimentation. In the years after the fall of the Wall, a unique subculture sprang up in the area around Hackescher Markt and Oranienburger Strasse. Art collectives and squatters moved into the empty, run-down buildings and brought new, alternative impulses to the area, symbolized today by places like the Acud Theater.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Prenzlauer Berg</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The district to the north-east of Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg, used to be the center of alternative culture and political resistance in the GDR. But it has since been flooded by wealthy West Germans, eager to settle in the charming turn-of-the-century houses around Kollwitzplatz. As in Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg is home to a thriving alternative culture, for example, in the Kulturbrauerei, which is now home to an arts and entertainment center and concert venue. Prenzlauer Berg is no longer an insider tip, but still has some of Berlin\''s best bars, restaurants and clubs.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Friedrichshain</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Friedrichshain, the district to the south of Prenzlauer Berg, has now taken over the mantle of the last outpost of indigenous, alternative Berlin culture. Architecturally speaking, Friedrichshain is an intriguing mixture of concrete socialist high-rises, monumental Stalin-era mammoths along Karl-Marx-Allee and stylish, late 19th-century town houses. The area around Simon-Dach-Strasse is heaving with alternative bars, cafés and clubs and is a popular spot with students.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kreuzberg</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Crossing the River Spree on the Oberbaumbrücke, we reach the legendary Kreuzberg district. Situated next to the Wall in former West Berlin, Kreuzberg became infamous during the 1960s and 1970s as the center of West Germany\''s anarchist scene - a haven for squatters, hippies, punks and left-wing intellectuals. Although any remaining anarchists have long since fled to neighboring Friedrichshain, Kreuzberg is still the venue for violent demonstrations every 1st of May - inevitably accompanied by pitched battles with the police. A safer bet is to visit the annual Carnival of Cultures, Germany\''s biggest multicultural street festival, which takes place here every summer. Kreuzberg is home to many immigrants, including some 200,000 Turks. Some of this Oriental flair can be experienced in the area around Kottbusser Tor and Oranienstraße, which also has numerous alternative bars and cafés.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Potsdamer Platz</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Heading up Friedrichstraße, past the ruins of Anhalter Bahnhof (an old train station) and the Martin Gropius Building, we leave Kreuzberg and enter the Tiergarten district at Potsdamer Platz. For many years a huge construction site, Potsdamer Platz is now complete. Boasting an enormous shopping center - the Arkaden - entertainment complexes such as the Cinemaxx and the Sony-Center, a casino and a musical theater venue, Potsdamer Platz is a magnet for tourists and locals alike.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Tiergarten</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The real highlight of this district is its sublime namesake Tiergarten park, a refuge for nature-lovers, joggers and sunbathers. Full of ponds, grottoes and dotted with sculptures, Tiergarten park is crowned in the middle by the golden Siegessäule victory monument. The world famous Berlin Zoo is also located inside the park.The north side of the park is the nerve center of political power. Lined up one after the other are the newly-constructed ministries, the monumental Reichstag parliamentary building and the equally monumental Chancellery, all in close range to the moving Holocaust Memorial consisting of numerous concrete blocks. Only the palatial Schloss Bellevue, seat of the German President, exudes some of the calm of the surrounding park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Schöneberg</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Schöneberg, a scenic 19th-century bourgeois quarter, is a popular place to go for an afternoon coffee, an evening cocktail or a bit of night-time partying. The cafés and bars around Winterfeldtplatz are always full, particularly after the market on Saturday afternoons. On the other hand, the streets around Nollendorfplatz and Motzstraße - home to Berlin\''s LGBTQ scene - are at their busiest (and most colorful) in the early morning hours.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Charlottenburg</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\''s high time to discover Berlin\''s second city center, the triangle between Ernst-Reuter-Platz, Wittenbergplatz and Adenauerplatz which makes up the center of western Berlin. Most of this area, which celebrated its heyday back in the Golden Twenties, lies in the Charlottenburg district. Its main artery is Kurfürstendamm, affectionately known by Berliners as \"Ku\''damm.\" This used to be one of Europe\''s finest and most elegant boulevards until World War II. It regained some of its flair in the 1970s and 1980s and is still a good place to see and be seen, but it is no longer quite as popular as Unter den Linden and Friedrichstraße in eastern Berlin, which attract more attention and more investment.The Memorial Church on Breitscheidplatz is always brimming with camera-wielding tourists. Ku\''damm\''s side-streets still bristle with theaters and hotels, such as the Kempinski and Savoy - with boutiques, sushi bars and art galleries. The area around Savignyplatz is a great place to go for a bite to eat or for a late-night cocktail, while the food hall on the top floor of KaDeWe department store is a feast for the senses.Charlottenburg\''s crowning glory is the magnificent Charlottenburg Palace, featuring dozens of opulently decorated rooms and chambers, as well as the lush Royal Gardens, the perfect place for a relaxing Sunday afternoon stroll. Several world-class museums - the Egyptian Museum, Bröhan Museum and the Berggruen Museum - are located close to the palace. Further south, the Funkturm, a smaller copy of the Eiffel Tower, towers over the Exhibition Center, offering great views over western Berlin. Well, we\''ve now covered the inner city, so what do the remaining districts have to offer?</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wilmersdorf</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The southwest of the city is the place where wealthy Berliners live. Largely spared during the war, there are hundreds of beautiful villas in Grunewald, part of the Wilmersdorf district and around Dahlem in Zehlendorf, which is also home to Berlin\''s Free University. The area around Lake Wannsee is a particularly popular spot with Berlin\''s high-society - perfect for mooring the yacht at the bottom of the garden!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Steglitz</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Steglitz is friendly, green and clean and has two major attractions: the spectacular Botanical Gardens and some wonderful shopping facilities around Schlossstrasse.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wedding & Neukölln</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">More down-to-earth are the working-class districts of Wedding in the north and Neukölln in the south, which is sometimes referred to as the Berlin Bronx. Although they both have a reputation of being not as nice as others, they are not as bad as they are made out to be. In fact, they are lively places with an earthy proletarian flair, a place to meet real Berliners.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Eastern Districts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The eastern districts, on the other hand, can\''t escape from the shadow of Communist East Germany, even though much has changed here since the fall of the Wall. Most of the gray concrete towers in places like Lichtenberg, Weißensee, Treptow, Hohenschönhausen or Marzahn have been repainted in friendly pastel colors and now boast the largest entertainment complexes and the most modern shopping malls in the region. There\''s plenty to discover here, such as the world\''s second biggest Jewish Cemetery in Weißensee or the monumental Soviet War Memorial in Treptower Park.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The magnificent architecture of the building and its constantly changing exhibitions give the tourist the perfect excuse to come to the banks of the Nervión. Nearby one can find the Museo de Bellas Artes, one of the most important art galleries in Spain, which has been able to avail itself of the success of the Guggenheim. The choice of museums is completed by the Museo Vasco (the Basque Museum) and the Museo de Reproducciones Artísticas, Museo de Arte Sacro and the Museo Taurino. The Bilbao Arts District, an art-powered initiative has backed the expansion of the arts scene in Bilbao. The Sala Rekalde Contemporary Art Gallery is part of this initiative, and promotes several emerging Spanish artists.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts and Concerts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bilbao hosts a wealth of local cultural venues that promote theater and arts, from the Palacio Euskalduna that features opera acts and classical concerts, to Teatro Campos Elíseo that stages everything from contemporary concerts to avant-garde plays. The La FuNdicIOn Bilbao also has an exciting program throughout the year. In the world of theater, the Teatro Arriaga is worth a mention, an architecturally impressive building situated in the Casco Viejo. The Bilbao Exhibition Centre, a sprawling congress venue on the city\''s outskirts hosts large-scale music concerts as well, as does Sala Santana 27.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Live Music Venues, Nightclubs and Bars</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bilbao has a large audience for dinner theaters as well as live music venues. Venues like Luz Gas, Kafe Antzokia and Azkena feed the city\''s appetite for both local and international touring bands who perform here regularly. Others like the Cotton Club double up as a Hollywood-themed nightclub and live-gig venue, and are keenly visited by indie loving youth in the city. La Ribera, an otherwise culinary-centric establishment serving <em>pinxtos</em> and delicious Basque cuisine transforms into the night to host an exciting repertoire of intimate music events and small concerts. Ambigú has a similar agenda, and hosts DJ nights to celebrate weekends. For intense partying scenes, visit Shake Bilbao, or join the raucous crowds at the LGBT-friendly La Lola. Past midnight, Bilbao\''s streets get taken over by a younger crowd who do their own hopping from bar to bar, normally along the streets like Barrenkale, Barrenkale Barrena, Somera and others. Some of the more popular bars in this part of town worth checking out include K2.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals and Events</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It is no surprise that Bilbao\''s colorful cultural landscape includes an impressive line-up of festivals and events that attract droves of crowds from across the nation and the globe. The Carnaval de Bilbao is a true-blue Basque celebration that commences the Saturday before Ash Wednesday, and continues for several days, finally culminating on Easter Sunday. A lengthy line-up of parades, music programs, competitions and more constitute this extravaganza.The Semana Santa is another cultural and religious festival celebrated in Bilbao. There are also a number of music and film festivals that take the streets of Bilbao by storm, including the Jazz Euskadi Festival, the Bilbao BBK Live which celebrates rock and pop music, the blues-festival Festival Internacional de Blues de Getxo, and the Bilbao International Film Festival.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Walk along the Ribera de Deusto to get a glimpse of how one part of the estuary flows through city life. While here, a must-see is the Universidad de Deusto. Established in the 19th Century and run by Jesuits, this university has been the alma mater of such luminaries as the banker Mario Conde, the politician Arzalluz or the former president (\"Lehendakari\") of the Basque government, Garaikoetxea. All in all, the neighborhood has a rather student-like feeling and is filled with bars, cafés, restaurants, etc. If you\''ve been out partying all evening, this is a great place to pass the very last hours of the night.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Uribarri & Begoña</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Still on the same side of the estuary, use either the Calatrava footbridge or the Puente del Ayuntamiento to get to District 2, called Uribarri.

From here you take the Funicular de Artxanda to the top of Archanda Hill, from where you can enjoy the fantastic views and the fresh air, or have a bite to eat in one of the many restaurants.  From here it\''s straight over to District 4, Begoña, where you will find the Santa María de Begoña, the \"Amatxo\" (mother) of Bilbao. Walk to the church along the Calzadas de Mallona, which begins in the Casco Viejo, you can also take the Ascensor de Begoña or the metro.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Casco Viejo</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is District 5, the Casco Viejo. It\''s clear how one can easily spend time in this lively neighborhood—eating and drinking in one of the numerous establishments, listening to the street musicians, and doing a bit of shopping. But before diving into the sensual delights of the Casco Viejo there\''s a few other things you could see, such as the Centro Cívico de La Bolsa o Palacio Yohn. Or look at  La Sociedad Bilbaína on Nafarroa Kalea, one of the old-established and most elegant cultural and recreational societies in Spain. For more high culture, cross the Puente del Arenal to visit the Teatro Arriaga and the San Nicolás de Bari church. Once there you can slowly make your way to Siete Calles by way of the Ribera, taking in the Puente de La Merced on the way to the Iglesia de San Antón (but don\''t forget to stop in the Mercado de La Ribera and admire the amazing selection of vegetables, fish and meat!). Once you are in the heart of Casco Viejo, just like a pilgrim tracing the route of the Camino de Santiago, make your final stop here at the Catedral de Santiago.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Abando</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Time to hop over to the other side of the estuary, to Abando, District 6. Beginning at the monument on the Plaza del Sagrado Corazón, stroll down the Gran Vía de Don Diego López de Haro. Measuring one-and-a-half kilometers (0.93 miles), this avenue is lined with houses with charming façades—keep an eye out especially for the Edificio Sota and the Edificio de la Diputación. A stroll down the Gran Vía will take you along the relaxing Parque de Doña Casilda Iturrizar with its Museo de Bellas Artes de Bilbao (Museum of Fine Arts). Halfway down the Gran Vía, there is the quaint Plaza Moyúa. At the far end of Gran Vía, you come to Plaza Circular where the monument in honor of the founder of the town sits. Other places worth checking out in this area are the Iglesia de San Vicente, a church in 12th-century Basque Gothic style, the Jardín de Albia and the Mercado del Ensanche. As well, you\''re not far from two streets that are very popular for bar hopping, Ledesma and Licenciado Poza. From here you can see the city\''s \"other\" cathedral, that is to say, the Estadio de Fútbol de San Mamés, which may not be quite as spiritual as the Catedral de Santiago, but you can be sure there are many citizens of this town that consider the city\''s soccer team, Athletic de Bilbao, to be sacred. For real soccer fun head all the way to Mazarredo street and visit the little palace that houses the headquarters of the Athlétic. The area around Mazarredo is another very popular night haunt. And for lovers of a bloodier sport, one is not far from the Plaza de Toros de Vista Alegre (whose name ironically means \"Happy View Bullfighting Ring\") and its bullfighting museum, the Museo Taurino. There\''s a lot of other places to visit in this district, such as the Museo Guggenheim Bilbao, the Estación de Abando (a.k.a. Estación del Norte) with it\''s magnificent stained-glass windows, the Santa Casa de Misericordia, and the Azkuna Zentroa.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rekalde</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The last district, District 7, called Rekalde, is reached by crossing the highway to Larrasquitu. This is a popular excursion for people wanting to scale the Pagasarri hill. At the top there is a little refuge from where one gets some splendid views of the south side of the \"botxo\" (the pit). If you don\''t already know why Bilbao is known affectionately by this name, you will once you see it from here!</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Bogotá was a typical colonial city in the beginning, but around the turn of the 20th Century, other European tendencies began to replace the dominant Spanish influence. France\''s influence is evident in many of the palaces built during this period. Residential areas show English influence in houses built during the mid-20th Century. And finally, one can feel the United States\'' influence in the new skyscrapers and huge shopping centers built toward the end of the 20th Century. The best way to experience this vast variety of architectures is by visiting Bogota\''s distinct districts, which retain their rich individual characters.

Teatro Colón, in the Candelaria area, was built to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. This wonderful building hosts the Orquesta Sinfónica de Bogotá and the opera, among a host of other programs throughout the year. Another good place to hear music is the modern Teatro Colsubsidio.

There are numerous other museums with pre-Colombian and colonial exhibitions, such as the Museo Arqueológico, which has murals on its walls and a collection of pre-Colombian ceramics. The Museo de Arte Colonial once belonged to the Jesuits, who were expelled in 1767.

The Neebex Galeria, a colonial house-turned-art gallery in the colorful neighborhood of La Candelaria displays art by upcoming Colombian artists, and is worth a tour. As for others like the Galeria Baobab and Galería Cero, art is showcased through a modern lens, and through more contemporary mediums like videos. For avante-garde art, head to El Parqueadero, and head to Galería MÜ for a riveting collection of fine art photography.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">An enigmatic nightlife awaits avid partygoers at Bogota.

The residential sector lies toward the eastern hills. It is famous for its colonial houses with their wooden balconies and clay tile roofs.

A few steps toward the south, you will come across Palacio Echeverry, and Palacio de Nariño, the presidential residence.  Nueva Santa Fe, part of a project to revive the city center, lies to the south of La Candelaria. The new neighborhood is a perfect example of late-20th-century architecture in Bogotá. Nearby, you will see the impressive Archivo General de la Nación. Toward the north end of La Candelaria, very near the intersection of Avenida Jiménez de Quesada and Carrera 7, you will find another collection of interesting sites, such as the Palacio de San Francisco and the churches of La Tercera, La Veracruz and San Francisco.

Further north you will come across the Colegio Gimnasio Moderno, a school famous for its beautiful installations and for having educated several important national politicians.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chapinero</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This area between Calles 60 and 70 and between Avenida Caracas and Carrera 7 was one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in Bogotá in the mid-20th Century. Although it has gradually lost its prestige over the years, it is now an important shopping area. You will also find interesting buildings here, including the Neo-Gothic church Nuestra Señora de Lourdes and the Teatro Libre.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">El Campín</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On Avenida Ciudad de Quito, between Calles 53 and 63, lies the important sports and entertainment area of El Campín. Football games are held regularly in the Estadio El Campín.

Along the length of the street you will find numerous cafés, restaurants and shops. Have a look at the Mercado de las Flores, a flower market in the Parque El Virrey, just off Calle 87. Carrera 15 is also one of the most popular places to go out at night in Bogotá.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">La Zona Rosa</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This area is particularly famous for its restaurants and discotheques. The nightlife here is perhaps the liveliest in Bogotá. During the day, people come to shop, and at night they come to eat, dance and have fun. Into its small area, La Zona Rosa packs bars, restaurants and clubs that cater to every taste and every rhythm.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">La Calera</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This route through the city\''s east hills has one of the widest assortments of restaurants and discotheques in Bogotá.

On the weekends, the Vía de La Calera attracts and challenges many cyclists, who ride up and down one of the steepest streets in the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parque de la 93</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Since its beautification, the area around this park has become one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in Bogotá.

Films and everything to do with films is BIG here. Cinema halls like Regal and Liberty still carry on with the tradition of single screen theaters while multiplexes like PVR, INOX and IMAX are forever booked for the latest in Hindi and English films.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art and Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mumbai also has a thriving art scene. On par with the cultural capital New Delhi, it is always buzzing with exhibitions, book readings, talks, seminars and cultural festivals. Kala Ghoda is a very popular annual art festival that brings together renowned artists from all over the country.

The Bhau Daji Lad Museum in Byculla, located by the Byculla Zoo, is great for those wanting to know more about the city\''s fascinating transition from fishing villages to booming metropolis. Smaller museums like the Monetary Museum and the Railway Museum are specialized museums that have small but interesting exhibitions.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Amusement Parks and Family-Friendly Fun</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There\''s plenty to explore with kids in Mumbai.

 (325,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Mumbai</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mumbai is divided into two major districts- North and South Mumbai. If South Mumbai, also known as Town, is considered an elite address by every Mumbaiite, then Nariman Point is the Manhattan of the city, overflowing with high-powered corporate offices. It also has Dalal Street, the volatile stock market area. South Mumbai comprises areas such as Marine Drive (with beautiful art deco buildings), Byculla, Churchgate, Parel, Elphinstone Road, Mahalaxmi, Worli, and Kemp\''s Corner/Cumballa Hill. It has places of historical importance, wide roads, hundreds of high-rises, the luxury hotels, trendy bars and restaurants, and an eclectic mix of residents. But this was until North Mumbai caught on.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Colaba/Fort</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Part of South Mumbai, much of the city\''s historic character is visible along the colonial-era buildings and wide boulevards of Fort, remnants of British rule. Home to the heritage Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station (popularly called V.T. Station) and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (formerly the Prince of Wales Museum) this area is packed with popular attractions. Colaba is famous for its Causeway, a bargain-hunter\''s haven great for street shopping. Just a few minutes away is the Gateway of India from where boats to Elephanta Caves depart and the heritage Taj Mahal Hotel is located.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Girgaum</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Away from the colonial areas, lie what was once the Native Town; another enclave of South Mumbai.

Lalbaug is where the famous Ganesh Festival is at its peak and the Lalbaugcha Raja draws millions of visitors every year.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Western Suburbs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mumbai is a sprawling metropolis connected by the railway line, the artery of the city. The Western suburbs extend past Bandra, Juhu, Andheri and beyond. Due to soaring real estate prices in the \''town\'' or South Mumbai, the younger, working populations have migrated north to these suburbs, which as a result have a lively, upbeat character. Among these, Bandra, a trendy neighborhood full of coffee shops, eateries, independent boutiques and celebrity homes along with a beautiful heritage church, Mount Mary, and one of the busiest shopping streets, Linking Road, is a favorite choice for the younger crowd. Juhu\''s upscale villas and beachfront homes, dotted with the abodes of famous Bollywood actors, and home to the Prithvi Theater, is another landmark. Even further, Borivali with its Sanjay Gandhi National Park and ancient caves is worth a visit.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Central/Eastern Suburbs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Beyond Dadar, neighborhoods like Matunga, Chembur and Ghatkopar each have their own independent character, while satellite suburbs like Thane and Panvel are cities in their own right. Matunga is famed for its South Indian lunch homes and often people make the trip just to enjoy a delicious fluffy set dosa at one of the many <em>udipi</em> restaurants.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Navi Mumbai</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Modern Navi Mumbai, or New Bombay, as it was earlier known, is home to a conglomeration of new offices, residential complexes and mega malls. Of these, Vashi is the most developed and well-known and is a major commercial center. It\''s quite natural for mumbaikars to commute long distances and the network of public transport which includes three local train lines, a monorail and a metro connect these diverse neighborhoods with each other. Much of the commercial and office spaces are concentrated in hubs like Nariman Point, Lower Parel, Goregaon and Navi Mumbai, and several people commute to South Mumbai from outlying areas for work.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

As galleries go, visitors can stop by the Queensland Art Gallery and Gallery of Modern Art for the best the city has to offer.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater & Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Searching for a satisfying stage or screen sensation in Brisbane is simple. The Lyric Theatre is a major component of Brisbane\''s theater scene. While they provide the curtain for many international acts, the musty, hip La Boite theater and royal Princess Theatre offer smaller stage exhibitions all year round. Expressions Dance Company and Ballet, among others, also offer seasonal shows. Brisbane is also host to a menagerie of cinema megaplexes, such as the Garden City Megaplex. However, there more than enough venues for those with more independent and artistic tastes, as well.<div></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music & Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many internationally recognized, annual events use Brisbane as their stage. The Brisbane International Film Festival is one of the city\''s more prestigious events. Youth and alternative culture is celebrated yearly at Big Day Out, where some of the world\''s most spectacular alternative musical acts converge for an intense day of raging music. Also, the Brisbane Entertainment Centre presents local and international musical acts in concert throughout the year. Brisbane is a city that slips easily from lazy days to nocturnal fun, offering a casual yet cosmopolitan nightlife adventure. Fortitude Valley has become the hub of the Brisbane music scene.

The city itself also boasts many live music venues with Friday\''s presenting great rock cover bands. Catering to other tastes are Paddington Tavern and the Transcontinental, which delivers the best retro pop-rock from the \''80s.</div></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Brisbane\''s club scene has undergone a remarkable facelift in recent years and now spreads from the classy Paddington district along Caxton Street, through the city and into the dance heart of the Valley. The Caxton Street strip exhibits a musical mosaic with Hotel LA\''s contagious pop-dance. Further down the street, the Caxton Hotel is never shy with its 20-something crowd supporting renditions of \''80s and \''90s pop classics. Irish theme bars are a Brisbane signature. It\''s difficult to find yourself too far from an Irish bar, like the raucous Irish Murphy\''s downtown. For those who enjoy the atmosphere of a beer garden, the Victory Hotel and Breakfast Creek Hotel are excellent places to vanquish a few cold ales and meet new people.

The spectacular Conrad Treasury Casino looms proudly over the river whilst the Queen Street Mall\''s garnished modern decor greets shoppers, diners, and people-watchers with open arms. Built in 1828, the Old Windmill and Observatory are some of Brisbane\''s oldest buildings. Elsewhere, the city\''s Parliament House, built to French Renaissance style in 1868, is a classic example of the city\''s historical prowess.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Bank Parklands</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you can\''t go to the beach, then the beach will come to you. The South Bank is a true wonder of ambitious modern design. With a large swimming area and sandy beach, escaping from the city is as easy as a 30-second ferry ride. The nearly 16 hectares (40 acres) of parkland include some of Brisbane\''s finest restaurants and cafes, not to mention its own rainforest boardwalk. The popular South Bank markets are held on Friday evenings, Saturdays, and Sundays. The atrium snakes its way through the parklands from the Queensland Cultural Centre, which houses the Performing Arts Complex, Queensland Museum, Queensland Art Gallery, and State Library.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Riverside District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mirroring the diversity of the South Bank, this cityside complex is dissected by a lazy walkway, which curves past the City Botanic Gardens and hugs the foreshore with its traditional timber jetties and visiting touring yachts. Eagle Street Pier is the wining and dining area, while the Riverside Centre hosts a huge Sunday craft market.

Kangaroo Point rivals South Bank in style as it strives to become the south side\''s new home for fine dining. Woolloongabba is the gateway to the Gold Coast and southeastern Queensland. Known locally simply as The Gabba, the area has earned an international reputation as the location of the Brisbane Cricket Ground, home of the Brisbane Lions Football Team.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Milton, Paddington & Rosalie</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">These west side suburbs offer a change of pace from the frantic energy of The Valley. In Milton, Park Road\''s mock Eiffel Tower calls the discerning visitor to the city\''s most fashionable pavement café precinct. Rosalie, nestled in the western hills, conjures up visions of a small European community, with fine dining or relaxed, inexpensive fare available <em>al fresco</em> throughout the year. For the eccentric or exotic, Paddington\''s Latrobe Street has a selection of hidden-gem restaurants, galleries, and boutiques encased in colorful <em>Queenslander</em> cottages.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Around the Bay</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Within an hour\''s drive of Brisbane\''s downtown, the wonders of Moreton Bay provide the day-tripper with unequaled delights. Before leaving the mainland, a visit to the charming Manly Harbour is a must. A blend of new and traditional, this is the East Coast\''s largest pleasure boat marina, not to mention home to good food and shopping.A short ferry trip to Moreton Island reveals a realm of sand dunes, the world\''s highest coastal dunes, as well as dolphins and four-wheel drive adventures. Whether you choose to stay at the plush Tangalooma Wild Dolphin Resort or just camp along the beach, Moreton Island is a kaleidoscope of natural wonder. North Stradbroke Island is also stone\''s throw from the mainland. A Queensland treasure, it provides an escape to paradise without a long trip to get there. Within the National Park, Tortoise Lagoon and Blue Lake are spectacular.With a bridge connecting Bribie Island with the mainland, this is the most accessible destination to see the fauna-rich waters of the bay without getting your feet wet. Diving, fishing, and relaxing are the order of the day on this lively, well-populated island. Otherwise, a visit to the wonderful Abbey Museum is essential.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

St. Peter\''s Church is filled with 15th-century artwork and a common place for classical music performances, while the St. Franciscuskerk te Groningen hosts smaller orchestral groups.Brussels boasts six opera houses, the grandest being the De Munt/La Monnaie. This opera house was fully renovated in 1986 and is now one of the most modern opera houses in Europe. The Grand Foyer upstairs, where you can enjoy a drink at intermission, has not really changed. The parquet flooring and rococo décor have been retained, and the original ceiling in the main dome has been restored.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Brussels European Film Festival is an annual event where filmgoers can check out the latest in film from around Belgium.

Alternatively, the Gellert Hotel and Baths has artificial waves in the large pool and the paddling pool is full of very warm water.Further afield, kids love the Cogwheel Railway to the top of the hills, then on to the Children\''s Railway, where all the signal-men and conductors are children.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Budapest has a huge variety of museums!

The city\''s administrative flank, the Lipotvaros section, extends between Bajcsy-Zsilinsky utca and the Danube. It includes the Parliament Building and the many ministries that make up the country\''s administration. &nbsp;</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">District VI</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">District VI is the city\''s mainstream cultural wedge and features Andrassy ut, Budapest\''s most beautiful boulevard, that has two ends: the traffic center Deák Square where all three metro lines meet and Heroes\'' Square, one of the city\''s most important monuments that stands before the City Park. A short walk will take you to one of Budapest\''s main luxury attractions and what is one of Europe\''s largest spas, the Szechenyi Thermal Baths. The Andrassy utca is also considered Budapest\''s very own \"Broadway\" when it crosses Nagymezo utca and the Opera House, both of which are comfortably ensconced here among the hundreds of eclectic buildings. Franz Liszt ter has become the city\''s social hot spot, particularly during the summer when the hip hold court at the outdoor restaurants, bars and cafes that spill out onto the pavement.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">District VII</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">District VII is Budapest\''s historic Old Jewish Quarter, containing several synagogues, Kosher bakeries, restaurants, hotels, and a happening nightlife. One recurring architectural theme is the presence of long, interconnected courtyards that link two parallel streets, out of practical and strategic necessity. The most incredible example of this is the Gozsdu udvar.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">District VIII</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The 8th could also be known as the \"District of Ill Repute.\" Rakoczi ter has long since entered the lexicon as more than just a place name, but the district has done its best to shake off this reputation. A revitalization in the district has seen the the advent of local art galleries, shops, cafes and restaurants. The 8th is the place to go to catch a glimpse of the city\''s real past while enjoying the modern boom of the 21st Century and an off the beaten path, local scene.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">District IX</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">District IX, Ferencvaros, is similar in origin to the working-class 8th, except that it is now an popular and in-demand area. Trendy bars and cafes line Raday utca, popular with groups and stag and hen parties, and in the section bounded by the Nagykorut. It is definitely worth a visit for tourists as the marvelous Museum of Applied Arts can be found here. Though technically in the 8th district, the beautiful Hungarian National Museum with its unique architecture is just a few steps from Raday utca, and is also worth the trip.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">District XI</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">District XI is where the bourgeois of Buda lived before they took to the hills, but the area remains quite affluent. It curves around Gellért Hill and extends to the border of Budapest itself. Most of the activity in this district centers around Moricz Zsigmond Korter and the Technical University, which fronts a huge stretch of the River Danube between Szabadsag and Rákóczi bridges. To experience some solace in this bustling neighborhood make sure to take a trip to the Lake Feneketlen.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">District XII</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">District XII is the gateway to the Buda Hills and serenity, a mere few minutes from Moszkva ter. Buda\''s tallest hill, Janos Hegy, presides over this area, and there are many spectacular views to check out here from the chair-lift, Children\''s Railway and the Cogwheel Railway. The latter two also service Szechenyi Hill.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (401,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">La Boca</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tourists favor this picturesque district for its rich history and vibrant colors, notably the greens, yellows, reds, and purples that highlight the urban scenery. Genoese immigrants chose these colors for their classic <em>conventillos, </em>or tenements. These colors also dominate the works of painter Benito Quinquela Martín who immortalized his beloved barrio. In La Boca, you can eat lunch in a picturesque cantina while enjoying a fine tango show. Other attractions include the exhibitions organized by the Proa Foundation and the Museo de Cera, or wax museum.

Today, luxurious restaurants, offices, and movie theaters have replaced ancient brick silos, making this the city\''s most exclusive district, preferred by tourists and business travelers. Every Saturday and Sunday, Calle Vera Peñaloza becomes a pedestrian-only zone where the public can skate, ride bicycles, or stroll.

Stop by and find everything from antique wedding dresses to 1900s table settings or simply enjoy the improvisations of the street performers. Also worth visiting in San Telmo are the Pasaje de la Defensa, an 1880 mansion that has been converted into a commercial gallery, and the picturesque Balcarce street with its concentration of bars, restaurants, and tango houses.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Monserrat</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Monserrat is another historic district where evidence of Buenos Aires\''s past surprises visitors at every turn. In colonial times, Monserrat was the political, economic, social, and cultural center of the city. It is where the <em>Porteños</em> defended themselves against English invasions, and you can still experience history in Monserrat just by visiting its venerable buildings, streets, and underground tunnels. Take a stroll through Manzana de las Luces, contemplate the architecture of the Iglesia de San Ignacio, pass by the Cabildo de Luján, then take a rest in the historic Plaza de Mayo.

As a National Historic landmark, Shea\''s Performing Arts Center (opened in 1926) is home to the Irish Classical Theatre Company, the Alleyway Theatre complex, and the state-of-the-art Studio Arena. Here you will find every type of theatrical performance from operetta to full Broadway productions, avant-garde drama to modern classics. Another performing arts hub is the State University of New York at Buffalo campus in Amherst. The Center for the Arts is home to four theater venues including the 1,750-seat Mainstage, the only one of this size operating year-round in western NY. The 400-seat Drama Theater is ideal for musicals, the 180-seat Black Box is an experimental space and the 370-seat Katharine Cornell Theater was named after one of Buffalo\''s leading ladies. Buffalo\''s musical tastes can best be described as eclectic, ranging from the Buffalo Philharmonic, considered one of the best in the country and playing out of the acoustically-perfect Kleinhans Music Hall, to blues and jazz, with native sons such as Grover Washington Jr., Bobby Millitello, and Spyro Gyra. In fact, Millitello gets to blow his own horn at the family-owned Tralfamadore Cafe, one of literally dozens of pubs and clubs where jazz is part of the menu.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For a town that has spent most of its existence doing heavy industrial work, Buffalo has more than its fair share of art facilities. Start with the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, world-renowned for its collection of impressionistic and abstract works including Picasso, Van Gogh and Warhol. Then on to the Burchfield-Penney Art Center at Buffalo State College with exhibits by watercolorist Charles E. Burchfield as well as regional artists. Other important Buffalo galleries and exhibit halls include the Anderson Gallery, CEPA, Hallwalls Contemporary Art Center and the African American Culture Center, which sponsors African-American visual and performing arts and is home to the Paul Robeson Theatre. For the true arts and crafts believer, no trip to Buffalo is complete without a visit to the Roycroft Campus in East Aurora. Site of the crafts colony founded by Elbert Hubbard in the late 1800s, the campus today carries forth the original spirit with the Elbert Hubbard Roycroft Museum, Roycroft Shops, Roycroft Inn and Roycroft Potters. Another great shopping stop is the Fashion Outlets of Niagara Falls.Through it all, Buffalo hasn\''t forgotten its railroad and steel past. The Iron Preservation Society of Lovejoy runs the Iron Island Museum in honor of the community named for the fact it was surrounded by railroad tracks. In the same vein, the Lackawanna Public Library plays host to the Steel Plant and Local History Museum with photos, exhibits and memorabilia from the days when steel was king.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If galleries, museums and architectural gems are the muscle and sinew of Buffalo culture, then the numerous festivals are most certainly its lifeblood. It starts with ringing in the new year followed by a number of winter carnivals so that Buffalonians can thumb their noses at the snow. The snow melts just in time for the June Allentown Art Festival, a street event that draws more than 600,000 to the downtown area. July brings the two-day Taste of Buffalo along the Buffalo Place strip with music, arts and crafts and the opportunity to sample food from the city\''s top restaurants.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you can\''t wait for the festivals, there are plenty of hot nightspots to keep you moving. Buffalo\''s nightlife used to center around the Elmwood Strip but the place to be these days is on Chippewa, which borders on the Theater District. Once the city\''s red light district, Chippewa now sizzles with live music and dance clubs to suit every taste. Other popular nightlife areas include Allen Street, University Heights and Hertel Avenue.Perhaps the wildest club of all is Club Marcella, described as the best techno/trance/trip-hop place in the city, not to mention the compelling Saturday night drag queen shows while classic Taverns like Ulrich\''s Tavern, one of the oldest in the city, have retained an old-school vintage vibe.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A visitor doesn\''t have to stay long to realize Buffalonians are passionate about their sports teams. It\''s your choice to root for football with the NFL Bills, hockey with the NHL Sabres, the triple-A baseball Bisons, soccer with the Blizzards or lacrosse with the Bandits. This is the land of the Sunday afternoon tailgate party to root the Bills towards yet another shot at the Super Bowl. As you can see, there\''s more to Niagara-area entertainment than the falls with their deafening roar. What you get is the complete recreational package with 75,000 gallons of water roaring over a 300-foot (91-meter) cliff each second as the icing on the cake!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Recreation and Family Fun</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\''re chafing at the bit for a good bit of exercise, then Buffalo has plenty of options.

Polonia features traditional Broadway Market food vendors and the New York Central Terminal.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It is here that the 1929 Art Deco masterpiece, Buffalo City Hall, rises high above the treetops. Also, note the French Renaissance-style Ellicott Square Building finished in 1896 as the largest office building in the world at that time. Within the compact downtown is where you\''ll find the hive of performing arts activity known as the Theater District. Shea\''s Performing Arts Center, with its classic Baroque interior, serves as an anchor for the 20-block Theater District. You\''ll find plenty of nightlife in the Chippewa Club Zone, which rose from the ashes of the former red light district. Buffalo Place has a pedestrian mall and a reputation for being festival central. If ice hockey\''s your thing, you\''ll be interested to find the HSBC Arena (formerly the Marine-Midland) where the NHL Buffalo Sabres skate. And it\''s true - Buffalo chicken wings actually were created here, thanks to a stray shipment of wings that made its way to the Anchor Bar in the mid-1960s. Buffalo is also home to the Beef on Weck sandwich and it is the Friday fish fry capital of the world.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Larkinville</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the southeast of downtown lies Larkinville, once an industrial zone that\''s undergone revitalization.

From Food Truck Tuesdays to delicious eats at The Filling Station, this is a great place to enjoy a local vibe.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Buffalo</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Not to be overlooked, Buffalo is a mere 25 miles (40 kilometers) from what has been called one of the seven natural wonders of the world.

 (419,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In a city with 7000 years of history, it is easy to overlook the modern aspects of its culture. Cairo has a vibrant modern art scene, and several galleries scattered throughout the city are good venues to check out local artists. The downtown area has a great concentration of galleries to view contemporary art, and all are within walking distance of each other. From the changing exhibitions of modern art at the Zamalek Art Gallery and the Al Masar Gallery that hosts Egyptian art and artists, to the Gezira Center for Modern Art which is a stunning repository of more than 10,000 artworks on the eponymous island, Cairo proves to be a wondrous delight for ardent art lovers. The Picasso Art Gallery and the Karim Francis Gallery, both showcasing contemporary art, are also worth exploring.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cairo has numerous museums for just about every interest. The Egyptian Museum, located on Tahrir Square, is the first stop for most people interested in Egypt\''s Pharaonic past. The collection is extensive and exhausting; it may be best to plan a few trips in order to absorb it all. The Museum of Islamic Art and the Coptic Museum both have comprehensive collections and are located near other sites of historical interest, making the museum stops a nice break and a good way to synthesize things. Several specialty museums are worth checking out if their particular topic is of interest to you including the Geological Museum and the Railway Museum. At the Citadel, you can visit the Police Museum, the Military Museum and the Carriage Museum. Those interested in the pre-revolution period should visit the Abdeen Palace Museum and the Manial Palace Museum.The Gezirah Art Center, located in Zamalek, has a lovely collection of ceramics. The Mahmoud Khalil Museum in Dokki displays a private collection of European art - including works by Monet, Gauguin, Pissarro and Van Gogh.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cairo has dozens of cinemas screening new foreign and Egyptian films. Most foreign films are subtitled and edited by Egyptian censors. Modern cinemas like the Point 90 Cinema and the Renaissance Cinema on Corniche El Nil are good places to catch mainstream Hollywood as well as Egyptian movies. Many cultural centers occasionally run foreign film series, occasionally subtitled in English, including the French Cultural Center, the Goethe Institute, and the Italian Cultural Institute among others. The Cairo Film Festival takes place around the end of the year. Several theaters participate in the festival, and it is very popular as it is the only chance to see uncensored films during the year.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The new Cairo Opera House is the premier performance space in Cairo. Throughout the year, it hosts musical performances ranging from classical and opera to jazz and Arabic music, performed by both local and international artists. The Cairo Opera Company and the Cairo Symphony put on regular performances during the season. The Gumhuriya Theatre, a smaller venue than the Opera House, often has music performances as well. The El Sawy Culture Wheel, one of Cairo\''s most talked-about and most-visited music venues, hosts a oud and jazz performances regularly, as well as a program featuring Egyptian singers and bands. The El Dammah Theater is another notable live music venue that also hosts the Cairo International World Music Festival, while the Darb 1718 has two live performance stages at its location in Fustat.   Many popular nightclubs have regular live music performances such as the Cairo Jazz Club, where you can hear just about any variety of Western-influenced tunes including classical music. Many of the city\''s five star hotels also have live lounge singers, performing either Arabic or Western popular music.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dance</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Again, the Cairo Opera House is the first place to check for dance performances. The Cairo Opera House Ballet has a respectable repertoire and performs roughly from September to May, and the Opera House hosts a variety of foreign dance companies throughout the year ranging from classical ballet to modern and ethnic dance. Locally-choreographed modern dance performances are sometimes staged at the Opera. The Gumhuriya Theatre sometimes hosts foreign dance troupes. A \"tourist version\" of the whirling dervishes, a form of spiritual dance practiced by Sufis, can be seen on Wednesday and Saturday at Al-Ghouri Mausoleum near Khan el Khalili. The performance is free and usually fills up quickly, but it is well worth the wait in line.Belly dancing is performed all over the city in venues ranging from five-star hotels to more local downtown establishments. Several nightclubs on Pyramids Road and Al Haram Street also feature belly dancers.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most of the live theater you will see in Cairo is performed in Arabic, of course, and good venues include El Genaina Theater, the El Gomhoureya Theater and the Cairo Opera House. During the spring term, a popular theater festival is held where local writers are invited to contribute 15 minute scripts, which are selected by jury and then performed over a few nights.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mystical as ever, Cairo\''s many alleyways and covert <em>souks</em> are marked by a gaggle of shops that peddle everything from butter-silk <em>pashminas</em>, intricate jewelry and trinkets, to ornate lamps, <em>sheesha</em> pipes and heady perfumes. Some markets where you might be able to whisk away a memorable souvenir or two include the Khan El-Khalili bazaar in the Islamic district and the Souq al Goma, a Friday market thronged by locals and tourists alike. Don\''t be afraid to haggle here. For more upscale and international brands and options, indulge at the city\''s top malls such as the First Mall, the Mall of Arabia, or the Cairo Festival City Mall. The city\''s Zamalek district is also a fantastic option for jewelry.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cairo\''s nightlife, although not as dazzling as other capital cities, is still worth experiencing. It boasts a versatile repertoire that transcends mere belly-dancing nights, and includes everything from jazz clubs and live music venues, to cocktail bars and DJ-spinning dance clubs. The Stage One bar promises good nights ahead for the swish set visiting Cairo, while others like The Tap and The Garden are fantastic party spots. But for those crazy about jazz tunes, the Cairo Jazz Club is their best bet. &nbsp;</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (420,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Central Cairo</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The current heart of Cairo, the downtown region roughly centered on Midan Tahrir or the Liberation Square, stretches east to Ramses Station and south to Garden City. It is relatively young, as only in the mid 1800s was this area west of Ezbekiya to the Nile drained and developed. The architecture of the downtown cacophony of shops, restaurants, theaters, offices, apartment buildings, and five-star hotels possesses an old-world elegance. The area boasts numerous museums and contemporary art galleries. The Egyptian Museum, with its monumental collection of antiquities, is located on Midan Tahrir and requires several hours to peruse the collection. The office of the President of Egypt, the Abdeen Palace Museum displays a collection from pre-independence times. An arsenal religious landmarks - mosques and churches - also dot the various streets that slice through the city, instantly indicative of the city\''s solid religious spirit.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Old Cairo (Masr el Qadima)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sometimes known as \"Coptic Cairo,\" this area provides a historical link between Cairo\''s Pharaonic and Islamic periods. It is likely that the area was settled during the 6th Century BCE. It was here in 130 CE that the Roman emperor Trajan erected Babylon Fort, the core of the old city. The area features several old Coptic churches as well as Ben Ezra Synagogue - the oldest in Egypt. The ruins of the old city of Fustat, and the Rhoda Island, home to some of the oldest Islamic structures in Egypt, are also nearby. The Nilometer, a prolific structure dating back to 861 CE, built to measure the extent of Nile\''s flooding each year, is a rich historical treasure which is also located on the island.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Islamic Cairo</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The name of this district is misleading, as this fascinating part of the city is no more \"Islamic\" than any other. It seems to be the conventional way to describe the area that became the city center during medieval times. This area is very rich in history and culture, and takes days to explore thoroughly. Highlights of this district include the Citadel; the vibrant Khan el Khalili bazaar, which is brimming with small shops, craftsmen\''s workshops, restaurants and coffee houses; Al Azhar Mosque, a thousand year old center of Islamic study; the Gayer-Anderson Museum; and the City of the Dead necropolis, cemeteries that are also home to hundreds of living residents. Throughout the district, there are dozens of beautiful mosques with many different architectural styles and that are open to non-Muslim visitors. There are also several old houses and secular buildings, which have been converted into museums or public spaces.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Giza</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The area to the west of the Nile is technically a separate municipality from Cairo, but inextricably linked to the city. It is difficult to imagine that only a hundred years ago, the road leading west to the pyramids of Giza was a simple dirt track through an agricultural area. Now it is a clamorous wall of concrete and confusion, with numerous hotels, restaurants, nightclubs and residences. The Pyramids of Giza have drawn visitors throughout the centuries to gaze in awe at the \"glory of the ancients\". Surrounding the Pyramids area are the obligatory papyrus and perfume shops catering to the needs of the tourist.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dokki & Agouza</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Primarily a residential district comprising the villas and private sporting clubs of Cairo\''s movers and shakers and more cramped \"<em>baladi</em>\" quarters and market areas, there are a few interesting sites to visit in the area. These include the Mamhoud Khalil Museum, a refurbished mansion displaying mostly European art and sculpture collected by Khalil, a pre-war politician. Moving north along the Corniche, a main landmark is the center of the British Council, which offers language training in both English and Arabic.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mohandissen</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of Cairo\''s newer districts, this is a sprawl of residential and office towers, dominated by Arab League Street. The strip is replete with upscale boutiques and just about every American fast food chain imaginable. It is a veritable parking lot on summer nights as cars cruise up and down the wide avenue. Several cozy restaurants and pubs can be found tucked away in the maze of backstreets. The Cairo Contemporary Dance Center is also located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Gezira & Roda Islands</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The two main islands in the Nile are both developed to the point where you might forget you are technically on an island. Gezira, the northern island, can be divided into two separate districts. The southern half, Gezira proper, contains the new Opera House, where cultural performances are presented throughout the year. The Cairo Tower sits to the north and provides a spectacular panoramic view of the city from the top; on a clear day you can count pyramids in the distance. The northern tip of the island is the district of Zamalek, once a British neighborhood that miraculously retains a residential feel despite the dense population. Zamalek\''s multitude of popular Western-style bars and nightclubs are a big attraction. Most of the island is dominated by the Gezirah Sporting Club, a private sporting club.Roda Island is more densely populated, but is worth visiting for the Manial Palace built in 1903 by King Farouk\''s uncle Prince Mohamed Ali Tewfik. Look out for the five buildings in the palace grounds that have an eclectic architectural style. The museum has a lovely collection of old manuscripts. It typically does not see a lot of tourist crowds, which can provide a peaceful afternoon.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Heliopolis, Nasr City & Beyond</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The area east of the city center started being developed at the end of the 19th Century by a Belgian entrepreneur, Baron Empain, whose residence, now unfortunately closed, can be seen on the way to the airport. This upscale district has numerous Western-style shops and restaurants. The elegant buildings in the area around Midan Roxy are architecturally appealing. Interesting sites in this area include the October War Panorama and Sadat\''s Tomb, erected on the site where the late President was assassinated in 1981. Northwest of Heliopolis, and easily reached by Cairo\''s Metro line, is Matariyya. This contains the site of ancient Heliopolis, the City of the Sun - the earliest settlement in the Cairo area. The granite Obelisk of Senusert I (dating from around 1900 BCE) stands at Midan al-Misallah, and 500 meters (about a third of a mile) south stands the Virgin\''s Tree, which supposedly shaded the Holy Family during their time in Egypt.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Maadi</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the south of Cairo, the suburb of Maadi is a popular residential area for foreigners, and though it has been subject to rampant development, the tree-lined streets camouflaging private villas in the older sections of the district are a peaceful change to the hustle and bustle of the rest of the city. Felucca rides on the Nile departing from the docks along the Corniche in Maadi are a relaxing way to spend an afternoon.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Folk music like <em>baul </em><span style=\"font-style: normal\">and </span><em>Kabigaan, </em><span style=\"font-style: normal\">classical music and the popular </span><em>Rabindra Sangeet </em><span style=\"font-style: normal\">form the traditional structure of Bengali music. Apart from Bengali cinema tunes, a number of rock bands like Mohiner Ghoraguli, Chandra Bindoo, Bhumi and Fossils are popular; these bands sing in Bengali, and successfully blend Bengali folk music into the rock format.</span> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal\">The Dover Lane Music Festival, held every January, explores Indian classical music and features big names as well as new talent. The festival\''s venue, Najrul Mancha is also known to host a number of rock concerts throughout the year. Cultural clubs like Tollygunge Club and CCFC, shopping hubs like South City Mall, establishments like Dalhousie Institute and Weavers Studio Centre for the Arts, and pubs like Someplace Else, Roxy, Trincas and Soho organize a number of rock, jazz and classical music events throughout the year.While Bengal does not have a classical form of dance, folk dances, especially <em>Chhau</em>, have been around for a long time. Also, a number of traditional forms from other parts of India, like Bharatnatyam, Kathak, Odissi and Manipuri, are enjoyed by the people of Kolkata. Dance festivals and events, classical and otherwise, take place throughout the year. Multi-faceted venues like Nandan, Rabindra Sadan, Kala Mandir and Madhusudan Mancha host both, music and dance events throughout the year and are considered the most important in the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater & Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pioneered by acclaimed director Satyajit Ray, the Bengali film industry or Tollywood (a moniker inspired from the popular \''Bollywood\'' in Mumbai) is extremely popular in Kolkata. The love for cinema, however, extends to Bollywood, Hollywood and foreign cinema as well. The Kolkata International Film Festival, the largest of its kind in India, is held every November. The Tri-Continental Film Festival, and Kalpanirjhar International Short Fiction Film Festival are some of the other important film events. Goethe-Institut and Satyajit Ray Film & Television Institute are actively involved in bringing international cinema to the city. For the regular movie-watching experience, a number of old, single-screen cinemas like Priya Cinema still exist; however, modern establishments like INOX can be found all over the city.With abundant talent in acting, direction and script-writing, Kolkata is one of the most active theater-loving cities in the country. In fact, the biggest Indian theater event, Nandikar\''s National Theater Festival, is held here every December at the Academy of Fine Arts. The Kolkata theater calendar is filled with other festivals like National Children\''s Theatre Festival and a host of events and independent plays, leading some to dub the city as the \''theater capital of India\''. Important theater venues include Rabindra Sadan and Madhusudan Mancha.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art & Literature</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With the <em>patachitra </em>being the most important type, folk art from Kolkata is typical of Eastern India. During the British Raj, a specific style known as the Bengal School of Art was created. The movement was spearheaded by British art teacher Ernest Binfield Havel and supported by Rabindranath Tagore\''s nephew Abanindranath Tagore. While it was associated with Indian nationalism, the basic theory was to create a form of art based on Indian spirituality. The movement faded by the early 20th Century; however, Kolkata has produced many eminent Indian contemporary artists ever since. Art exhibitions are regularly featured in local papers, and the most prominent venues include Academy of Fine Arts, Birla Academy of Art and Culture, Weaver\''s Studio Centre of the Arts and Taj Bengal. Kolkata\''s contribution to the world of literature has been tremendous; authors and poets like Rabindranath Tagore, Vikram Seth and the contemporary novelist Amitav Ghosh hail from the city. The love for books is apparent at the Kolkata Book Fair (earlier Calcutta Book Fair and locally, Kolkata Boimela), which happens to be the world\''s largest non-trade book fair and Asia\''s biggest book fair. Regular exhibitions, book readings and launches take place at important venues like Rabindranath Tagore Centre, Asiatic Society, British Council Library, Goethe Institute</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">and bookstores like Oxford, Crossword and Starmark.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kolkata has a lively nightlife and covers the gamut from laid-back live music venues to swanky cocktail lounges. Park Street is an important nightlife hub: Tantra, Someplace Else, and Roxy are all known to be hot spots among the younger crowd. Venom, HHI Underground and Soho are popular nightclubs as well. International events, DJ nights and live music are a part of the Kolkata nightlife.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cricket and Football are the two major sports enjoyed by the people of Kolkata. Sourav Ganguly, former Indian Cricket Team captain, was a resident of Behala in the southern fringes of Kolkata. Eden Gardens Stadium in Esplanade has played host to a number of important tournaments in the past. Among the many football clubs in the city, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are some of the most popular. Football tournaments are played at the Salt Lake Stadium.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Religious Events</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">No other city in India celebrates religious festivals with as much pomp as Kolkata. Commemorating the Hindu goddess <span style=\"text-decoration: none\"><em>Durga</em></span>\''s triumph over <em>Mahishasura</em>, <em>Durga Puja</em> is held every fall and is considered the beginning of the festive season in Kolkata. The main festival of the city sees <em>pandals </em>(temporary temple-like constructions) set up all over the city, and the streets are crowded with people for the six-day long festival. Another festival, considered to be the equivalent of the Indian festival Diwali, is <em>Kali Puja</em> later in the year. Ratha Yatra organized by ISKCON is a street procession where the <em>Jagannath</em> chariot is carried to venues like Maidan.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Family-Friendly</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nicco Park, Nicco Super Bowl, Nalban Boating Complex, Science City and Millennium Park are best visited at leisure and are a great day out with the kids. There\''s no shortage of family-friendly fun in this vibrant city. From historical sights to museums and theme parks, there\''s lots to explore for visitors of all ages!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kolkata is a shopping destination for all budgets. From street markets like New Market, Gariahat and Kumortuli for bargain shopping and heritage complexes like Dakshinapan and Swabhumi for handicrafts and textiles to upscale malls and shopping centers like South City Mall and the ultra-luxe Quest Mall for international brands, there is something for everyone in this bustling city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A magnificent marble structure, the Victoria Memorial Hall, built to commemorate Queen Victoria is today a landmark and museum with several galleries housing historic memorabilia, artifacts, sculptures and art. The repository of  a myriad treasures, the Indian Museum is a behemoth filled with everything from rare fossils, Mughal fine art and even an Egyptian mummy! For science buffs, the Science City and Birla Industrial & Technological Museum are fun, educative experiences no matter your age. An insight into the illustrious Rabindranath Tagore awaits at Tagore House Museum.

 (430,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Central Kolkata</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Central Kolkata was the first developed area of the city; marshy wetlands were cleared and the area was converted into the political and commercial hub of the British East India Company in the late 18th and early-19th Centuries. While on one hand it houses the State Government\''s offices, on the other, beautiful colonial monuments and busy markets thrive. Central Kolkata can be said to fall between the Vidyasagar Setu</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">(Second Hooghly Bridge) and Howrah Bridge (Rabindra Setu), with neighborhoods like B.B.D. Bagh, Maidan and Hastings along the Hooghly, and extending eastwards up to Taltala, Park Street and Park Circus. In between, other neighborhoods include the Esplanade (Chowringhee and New Market), Chandni Chowk, Barabazar (and Posta Market) and Bowbazar. The larger neighborhood of Dharmatala includes parts of Bowbazar, Entally and Moulali but its exact boundaries stretch further. The relatively smaller areas of Outram Ghat and Janbazar also lie within. The area is bound by Strand Road along the Hooghly, AJC Bose Road on the south and east, and Mahatma Gandhi Road on the north. Since the roads here tend to be extremely congested, metros are the fastest mode of transport when in Central Kolkata; it is also well connected by trams and buses. BBD Bagh: Once known as Dalhousie Square, B.B.D. Bagh</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">is a historic area around Lal Dighi and is marked by important political buildings like Writers\'' Building</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">and Raj Bhavan. In the same vicinity, Town Hall, Calcutta High Court, Kolkata GPO</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">and St. John\''s Church</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">with Job Charnock\''s Mausoleum are constructions from the British Raj era and display neo-Renaissance architecture. Along the Hooghly (on Strand Road), you will find a number of government offices like Kolkata Port Trust Headquarters, Central Excise and Customs House. With numerous banks, commercial offices, foreign embassies, the Eastern Railway Headquarters and the Calcutta Stock Exchange, this is the commercial and political hub of the city. Esplanade: Kolkata\''s most beloved neighborhood, Esplanade is colloquially pronounced \''splan-edd\''. However, defying the traditional definition, Esplanade does not run along the Hooghly, but somewhat parallel to it and includes the area earlier known as Chowringhee and the adjoining New Market</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">area. Shaheed Minar and its surrounding street food stalls are just behind the Esplanade Bus Terminus on Dufferin Road, Indian Museum is on the Jawaharlal Nehru Road (formerly Chowringhee Road) and the Tipu Sultan Mosque is on Lenin Sarani. This is one of the most crowded areas of the city and with a number of souvenir shops along New Market, it is a strong tourist magnet. Historic eateries like Ralli\''s and Aminia are also here. On the Hooghly end, near Babughat and Outram Ghat, is the famous Eden Gardens Stadium.Maidan: Marked by large green patches, Maidan is considered to be \''the lungs of Kolkata\''. The area is mainly made up of three large compounds, namely Fort William, Kolkata Race Course and Victoria Memorial. Major attractions like St. Paul\''s Cathedral and Birla Planetarium also fall in this neighborhood. Along the Hooghly (on Strand Road), on the southern end of Fort William is the Prinsep Ghat monument with the Vidyasagar Setu in the background. Smaller areas like Hastings and Kidderpore are to the south. With wide roads and ample greenery, this area is a pleasure to navigate.  Park Street: Lined with restaurants, both old and new, Park Street was once an icon of glamor and grandeur. During the British Raj era, cabaret performances and musical soirées were the order of the day and the area resounded with celebration and laughter on most nights. Today while many of the old restaurants like Mocambo, Moulin Rouge and Trincas still exist, newer additions like Flurys have also been made to the restaurant row. An important landmark near the Park Street Metro Station, is The Asiatic Society. Today, the street is still a popular destination among locals and tourists alike. Park Circus: Park Circus, marked by the Park Circus Maidan is the point where many central streets meet. The famous 7-point Crossing is here. The area has a predominantly Muslim population and is dotted with a number of Masjids and Dargahs. Don Bosco School and Lady Brabourne College are also situated here. The Park Circus Connector to EM Bypass is one of the most important roads of the city.  Taltala: The area gets its name from its Palmyra trees that are locally known as <em>Tal Gachh.</em> The locality is home to a large Muslim community, with the earliest settlements dating back to the early-19th Century. An old locality of Kolkata, Taltala is an important assembly constituency and has a police station within. This area is not especially popular with tourists, as it is mostly a residential area.  Bowbazar & College Street: In the early-19th century, while the central area was known as \''White Town\'' and other smaller areas became \''Native Town\'', the adjoining Baitakkhana, Dharmatala and Janbazar areas fell in the in between zone. At the time Bowbazar came to include a multi-ethnic community of Armenians, Portuguese, Chinese. Today the <em>bazar</em> or market area is famous for its variety of jewelry and music shops marked by narrow lanes and large crowds.A few minutes to the north is the famous College Street area, where visitors can find the Presidency College, Hindu School and the Indian Coffee House. Burrabazar & Posta Market: Burrabazar literally translates to \''Big Market\'' and consists of a large wholesale market. The area had always been reserved as a market; however, its current status is in sharp contrast to the wealthy merchants that dominated the area during the British era. Posta Market, although spread over a smaller area, has more or less the same story and is now considered a part of Burrabazar. This market stocks a wide variety of goods from textiles to tea.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Kolkata</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">South Kolkata is a well planned area, with somewhat clearer divisions of neighborhoods within. While a major part consists of residential spaces, a number of attractions, shopping options and restaurants can be found here as well. Bound by AJC Bose Road on the north, neighborhoods like Alipore, Bhowanipore and Ballygunge are a stone\''s throw away from Central Kolkata. Further down south are the major areas of Kalighat, Lake Gardens and Tollygunge. Jodhpur Park and Jadavpur are predominantly residential areas. Jadavpur is famous for the Jadavpur University. Alipore: Just south of Maidan, continuing the pattern of clean roads and greenery is the Alipore area. A few kilometers away from Victoria Memorial and Fort William, Alipore is where the infamous Alipore Jail stands. With major landmarks like National Library, Agri Horticultural Gardens and Zoological Gardens, the area ensures easy navigation. Taj Bengal, a luxury offering, is also found here. The New Alipore area is an extension of this neighborhood, mostly housing government and commercial offices. Bhowanipore: Situated between Alipore and Ballygunge and just north of the Kalighat & Lake Gardens area, Bhowanipore has a balanced mix of residential areas and commercial streets. Netaji Bhavan on Elgin Road is an important landmark. Considering its proximity to Central Kolkata, Bhowanipore has a number of strategically located budget stay options on Sarart Bose Road. Ballygunge: Ballygunge is a posh locality with many modern residential areas. As you enter via the Syed Amir Ali Avenue, Birla Mandir and Calcutta Ice Skating Rink are prominent landmarks. Restaurants like 6 Ballygunge Place, Red Hot Chilli Pepper and Mainland China are popular haunts. The Goethe Institut, Birla Industrial & Technological Museum (BITM) and ISKCON are also in this area.  Gariahat: Although Gariahat is considered to be part of Ballygunge, the busy market place is a far cry from the relatively modern Ballygunge surroundings. Situated at Rash Behari Avenue, the popular Gariahat Market is just off the Gariahat Crossing.  Kalighat & Lake Gardens: Kalighat is a densely populated neighborhood with the main attraction being the Kalighat Kali Temple. Other important landmarks include Lake Kalibari, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Golpark and Birla Academy of Art & Culture. Major Durga Puja venues like Deshapriya Park and Triangular Park are also situated here. In the same vicinity, Lake Gardens is the area around the Dhakuria Lake or Rabindra Sarobar and includes important event venues like Najrul Mancha and Rabindra Sarobar Stadium. Lake Gardens has a peaceful atmosphere, surrounded by greenery, and as a result dotted with young couples.  Tollygunge: Named after William Tolly who was involved in the early development of the area, Tollygunge is home to the Bengali film industry or \''tollywood\''. The rapidly developing residential area is also known for its concentration of schools, colleges and institutes. Tollygunge Club, Royal Calcutta Golf Club and South City Mall are major landmarks in this area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Kolkata</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">North Kolkata has a typical environment: wide main roads with a constant flow of traffic, narrow by lanes and buildings that date back to the 19th Century are some of the main features of this area. Most of the neighborhoods within are historically important, although may not have as many touristic attractions. The area tends to be crowded with people all the time. Using the tram service is one of the best ways to tour some of these neighborhoods; trams take you through the areas at a leisurely pace. Dubbed as the \''cradle of Bengal Renaissance\'', the northern neighborhood of Jorasanko is the site of Jorasanko Thakur Bari - Rabindranath Tagore\''s ancestral home - and includes the important institution of Adi Brahmo Samaj.  Large market areas like Shyambazar, Shobhabazar, Kumortuli and Bagbazar are a display of the bygone grandeur. However, the forlorn buildings somehow create a sense of strange nostalgia.  Another northern neighborhood, Jorabagan, is said to be the place where East India Company employee Job Charnock first landed. It also includes the Hindu cremation ground known as Nimtala Ghat; a memorial stands on the site where Rabindranath Tagore was cremated. Chitpur and Cossipore are neighborhoods that lie further up north and are largely industrial areas with a number of factories and <em>godowns</em>. The Gun and Shell Factory in Cossipore holds the distinction of being the oldest functional factory in the Indian subcontinent.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">East Kolkata</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">East Kolkata is distinctly different from any other part of the city: with the planned township of Salt Lake City and the upcoming Rajarhat area, this part of the city is truly metropolitan. Tangra, Kolkata\''s Chinatown, is also included in East Kolkata. Tangra: Kolkata\''s Chinatown had more than 350 tanneries at one point of time and the residing Chinese made the leather industry in Kolkata a profitable one, providing employment to many. Since the Chinese also bought their cuisine to the area, a new kind of fusion cuisine, made to suit the Indian and specifically, Bengali palette was created and this came to be known as \''Indian Chinese\''. Salt Lake City: Built between 1958 and 1965, Salt Lake City, like the name suggests is a city planned around salt water bodies. The intelligent design seamlessly blends the natural beauty of the area with modern infrastructure. The saucer shaped area is divided into five sectors and is defined by wide roads and ample space. Around the Central Park, attractions like Nalban Boating Complex, Nicco Park and Salt Lake Stadium, shopping complexes like Swabhumi and Mani Square Mall and a number of restaurant complexes and entertainment venues are scattered across the sectors. This is the IT hub of the city and also has a number of residential areas and facilities like schools and colleges.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dum Dum</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Dum Dum houses the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport and is about 12 kilometers away from Salt Lake City and 18 kilometers away from the city center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Howrah</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although a different city on the western banks of the Hooghy, Howrah is often considered a part of Kolkata. The Grand Trunk Road is an extremely important trade route and connects Kolkata to important national highways. The Howrah Station is one of the most important landmarks, with a busy bus stand and a jetty stop around it. The Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Botanical Garden is in the Shalimar area of Howrah.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Northern Fringes</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pilgrimage spots like Dakshineswar Kali Temple and Baranagar (Kancher Mandir and Path Bari) are situated in the northern fringes of Kolkata.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Southern Fringes</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Areas like Barisha, Garia and Joka are at the extreme south of the city. These are mostly residential surroundings that do not include many touristic attractions. However, a number of prestigious <em>Durga Puja </em>venues fall in this part of the city</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

They contrast sharply with the dry, flat prairie stretching off to the east and south, and are dwarfed by the jagged ramparts of the Rocky Mountains looming to the west. Pinched between the slopes of one of the world\''s most rugged mountain ranges and the soft, fertile waves of the grasslands, Calgary is a city constantly on the move, rarely pausing to catch its collective breath before the next boom sweeps it off its feet. The city sprawls from the foothills of the Rockies in the northwest to the rolling hills and farm country of the southeast. It is divided into four quadrants intersecting at the confluence of the Bow and Elbow Rivers, which meet at right angles in the city center. Center Street runs north to south, and Center Avenue east to west, with all streets laid out in a grid expanding outwards from the center.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

For a unique football experience, drop by McMahon Stadium on any chilly autumn Sunday to see rabid fans, wearing nothing but bathing suits and body paint, as they cheer on the Calgary Stampeders amidst driving sleet and hail. Impervious to cold, such hardcore cheering squads often brave -10 degrees Celsius weather; fueled by a healthy supply of beer, will remain outside for the duration of the game. After hosting the 1988 Olympic Winter Games, the city gained attention for its excellent athletic facilities and became a destination for world-class athletes. At 4,000 feet (1,219 meters) above sea level, the high altitude and thin mountain air enhance training and attract athletes from all over the planet. The Olympic Oval speed skating track is a famous spot for the setting of world records. Spruce Meadows is one of the world\''s most famous equestrian facilities, and the site of several prestigious show jumping competitions. The Calgary Exhibition and Stampede is undoubtedly Calgary\''s biggest event, and claims to be the largest festival in Western Canada. Over a million people pour into the city to watch the bull and bronco riding, chuckwagon races, and receive a heaping dose of cowboy culture.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you want to get some skiing done but don\''t have time to drive to Banff and the Rocky Mountain ski resorts, Canada Olympic Park, site of many of the events in the 1988 Olympics, is located about five minutes from downtown and features several lifts and lots of artificial snow. For a real adrenaline rush, watch the Nordic ski jumpers as they launch themselves off the 90-meter ski jump and soar hundreds of feet through the air. For a more relaxed skiing experience, Wintergreen Ski Area lies just outside the rustic hamlet of Bragg Creek, a 40-minute drive from downtown. With several small lifts and cross-country ski trails, it is ideal for beginning skiers. In the summer, horseback riding and cycling are the best ways to explore the forests and mountains of the parks surrounding the city. Guided tours are available in Kananaskis Country to the west of the city, as well as in and around the city itself. For those looking for a more leisurely adventure, canoes and drift boats can be rented for a pleasant float down the Bow River.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater and Comedy</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater groups include the Loose Moose Theatre, which is renowned for its hilarious improvisational sessions. For large theatrical productions, the Arts Commons is a multi-venue complex, including the 1,800-seat Jack Singer Concert Hall and the 180-seat Big Secret Theatre.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping in Calgary is easy. There are about a dozen shopping areas in the city, each unique in character and merchandise. 17th Avenue is lined with trendy clothing and jewelry shops, Kensington Village caters to the artistic and international crowd, downtown is home to both Bankers Hall and Stephen Avenue Walk, and Eau Claire Market is a showpiece of independent small business. Inglewood and Marda Loop areas cater to the more eclectic shoppers with vintage galleries and unusual import shops, and Macleod Trail boasts a selection of hundreds of discount warehouses and huge shopping malls like the Chinook Centre.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Calgary has a plethora of mainstream and alternative cinema choices for the discriminating moviegoer. Cineplex Odeon theaters are scattered throughout the city, and every major shopping center has a cinema hidden in it somewhere. The Plaza is a pillar of the local independent film community, while the Westhills 10 Calgary has all the newest, big-budget flicks.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Concerts and Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Calgary plays host to most North American rock and pop tours with a steady stream of concert dates throughout the year. Jazz and blues fans will be delighted by the Calgary Jazz Festival, held every year in July. Aficionados of classical music will enjoy the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, which performs on a regular basis at events throughout the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Interpretive Sites</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For explorers young and old, Calgary has a wealth of museums and exhibitions, including the Glenbow Museum and Heritage Park Historical Village. The Calgary Zoo, Botanical Garden and Prehistoric Park showcases flora and fauna from every corner of the globe, while an hour\''s drive from Calgary in the town of Drumheller, the Royal Tyrrell Museum will astound and fascinate dinosaur lovers and naturalists with one of North America\''s largest dinosaur skeleton collections.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightclubs are party atmosphere may not be things Calgary is readily associated with, but few can deny the city\''s wealth of nighttime distractions. Fans of stand-up comedy will be found huddled around the modest stage at the Broken Bar for their weekly comedy nights, while the young and restless head to nightclubs like Jimmy\''s, Eden and Habitat Living Sound for DJ-spun sounds. The Commonwealth is another popular nightlife venue, established by local DJs to offer a curated selection of music from varying genres. Gay bars like the Twisted Element and the Hifi Club boast a distinctive verve, while Cowboys Dance Hall is a haven for die-hard fans of country music. There are plenty of laid-back bays with inviting patios, sports bars bursting with energy and neighborhood pubs as well, making for a colorful, enthusiastic and ever-changing nightime landscape in Calgary.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (440,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown/Eau Claire</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Less than a century old, the city hasn\''t had time to develop a rich heritage, but instead has built a rough and ready character full of youth that thrives on spectacle and excess. Calgary\''s downtown area is bustling and always on the move. From the noise and bravado of the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede, billed as the \"Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth,\" to the more subdued opulence of the Fairmont Palliser Hotel\''s famous galas, the city vibrates with a barely-controlled energy straining to rush after the next trend.  Calgary Tower remains downtown\''s most recognizable landmark, and is a must for those looking to get a bird\''s eye view. Devonian Gardens is a welcome refuge for nature lovers, while Olympic Plaza offers ice-skating in the winter and a wading pool in the summer.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Southwest</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Southwest extends from the forests of Kananaskis Country to the office towers of downtown, and is a mix of residential and business districts. It includes the natural beauty of North Glenmore Park, and the haute couture and fashion of the 17th Avenue shopping section. The Southwest is also home to the Fourth Street Restaurant district and the Elbow River, which winds its way from South Glenmore Park down through the city center until its rendezvous with the Bow River near Inglewood. The Eau Claire Market and riverfront trails around Prince\''s Island Park provide a clean and refreshing break from downtown, and are popular lunch spots with downtown office workers.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Southeast</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Southeast is home to vast oil refineries, fabrication plants, and heavy industry, as well as trendy new housing developments and the world famous Spruce Meadows equestrian facilities. Its western boundary is defined by the Macleod Trail Strip - 10 miles of flashing neon, huge nightclubs, malls, hotels, and luxury car dealerships. In the north end is the Saddledome and Stampede Grounds, as well as the historic district of Inglewood and the old town-site of Fort Calgary.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Northeast</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Northeast is separated from the rest of the city by the Deerfoot Trail, a freeway which carries most of Calgary\''s commuter traffic and is one of the most dangerous roads in Canada. Comprised mostly of older working-class neighborhoods interspersed with industrial areas, the Northeast is the place to find factory-outlet shopping, as well as the Calgary Zoo Botanical Garden and Prehistoric Park and Calgary International Airport.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Northwest</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the Northwest you can find many of the city\''s academic institutions and athletic facilities, as well as its upscale residential districts. Both the University of Calgary and the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology are located here, as well as the Canada Olympic Park and McMahon Stadium. On the banks of the Bow River and close to downtown is Kensington Village, a collection of shops, galleries and restaurants catering to the more artistic crowd. Kensington\''s famous eateries represent almost every ethnic cuisine, from Thai to Ethiopian to Irish, and are popular lunch spots for downtown executives.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

A city steeped in history, Cambridge is also at the forefront of 21st-century technology. It remains a magnet for those who desire both the experience of the old and the excitement of the new. Cambridge\''s main attractions are all within easy walking distance, best enjoyed with a lazy stroll around its famous streets.

For student-led performances (for example at the ADC Theatre, as well as in the many colleges), see the Listings sections of the two student newspapers <em>The Cambridge Student</em> and <em>Varsity</em>; these list the details of the plays and events showing during university term-time. As at Oxford, many a famous thespian has honed his or her craft at the university. All year round drama is, of course, available at various locations throughout the city. The Cambridge Arts Theatre (and The Playroom) in St Edward\''s Passage, offers mainstream theatre and the very best family orientated shows in town as well as more eclectic productions. The ADC Theatre on Park Street plays host to numerous productions — and also has at least 20 student shows a year, including themed productions at key times in the year (for example, Christmas), as well as comedy shows. A little way outside the city proper, the Cambridge Junction hosts an eclectic line up of comedy and dance performances while regular dance performances and musicals are staged at The Corn Exchange. For those looking to catch up-and-coming talent alongside touring companies and student productions, the Mumford Theatre is a great choice.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are two multiplex-style cinemas in Cambridge: the Vue Cinemas at The Grafton Centre and The Light Cinema at the  Cambridge Leisure Park which offer all the latest blockbusters. The Cambridge Arts Picture House on St Andrew\''s Street shows a huge variety of less mainstream and foreign language films each week. Themed weeks are a specialty of this cinema, and its cafe and bar are particularly popular. Every September the Cambridge Arts Picture House hosts the Cambridge Film Festival, which is a favorite with cinephiles for its exciting lineup and open-air cinema events by the river.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Thanks to its student population, Cambridge has a great after-dark scene. From nightclubs and lounges to laid-back pubs and bars, there\''s something for everyone here. The city\''s largest nightclub, Bellare combines cocktails with DJ-spun tracks for a fun night out while those looking for an upscale clubbing experience should head to Kuda, where you\''ll get VIP treatment alongside the hottest House, Pop and R&B tunes. Dress smart at the weekend and expect to queue. Life, just off Sidney Street is popular with both town and gown. Again, there is a range of music on offer, depending on the night — EDM, pop, retro, rock and dance. If you\''re looking for mellow late night vibes, or just a change from large disco style clubs, then there\''s The Fez in Market Passage. There\''s plenty of seating for when you want a break and a good variety of music including salsa and hip-hop. Of course, if you want even more choice you can always catch a fast train to the big city!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music and Dance</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you want to hear some great live music then explore the world outside the city center. The Portland Arms on Chesterton Road has live bands, including funk, indie, traditional folk and pop, several days a week. Various other venues include the following pubs which cater for a wide variety of musical tastes: Seven Stars on Newmarket Road and the Clarendon Arms in Clarendon Street, which has modern jazz every Wednesday night. For more jazz and blues, check out the Cricketers\'' Arms in Claredon Street and the Elm Tree in Orchard Street as well as the Claredon Arms near Parker\''s Piece. For live folk music at the weekend there\''s Live and Let Live in Mawson Road. Two excellent large venues stage a variety of music and comedy. The centrally located Corn Exchange on Wheeler Street, a former market hall, puts on regular opera, ballet, musicals, orchestral gigs and the majority of the city\''s major music band concerts. Further afield is The Cambridge Junction on Clifton Road which is much more rock, indie, jazz and soul focused, though it also hosts a number of famous comedy and dance acts throughout the year. King\''s College in King\''s Parade is a favorite for choral and classical music, and is popular with many visiting artists. Lunchtime concerts, in everything from classical music to medieval Spanish singing, take place at Kettle\''s Yard.For classical and orchestra symphonies, the West Road Concert Hall and the Saffron Hall welcome international and nationally renowned artists as well as the lauded London Philharmonic Orchestra.Those on a budget can head to the Mumford Theatre during term time for their free Lunchtime Concert Series from the <span>Anglia Ruskin University\''s Department of Music and Performing Arts.</span></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art and Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kettle\''s Yard on Castle Street is a wonderfully preserved home linked with the Bloomsbury set and which now hosts a wide variety of artistic endeavors. The Fitzwilliam Museum has a marvelous collection of ceramics, art (Rubens, Monet, and Picasso), Egyptian galleries, illuminated manuscripts and classical statues. There\''s also the Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre to explore on Bridge Street (the Round Church). And don\''t forget the many historical colleges of the university, which are dotted around the city center!</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (450,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cambridge City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">First-time visitors will wander anxiously, asking themselves, \"Where\''s the university?\" But Cambridge University has no campus. Instead, its colleges are scattered around the center, from the tight courtyards of Gonville and Caius College to the confident expanse of Trinity College; while its gardens are awash with floral color; and its faculties tucked way down alleyways. Be spellbound by the majesty of the King\''s College Chapel or explore fine wines at the Cambridgeshire Wine School. The Cambridge University Botanic Garden promises a picturesque afternoon admiring the gorgeous landscaped lawns and the exotic flora from around the world! Many of the museums are also owned by the university, such as the Fitzwilliam Museum with its vast, rich galleries. Contrast this to Kettle\''s Yard\''s modern art displayed in a narrow cottage. Abandon the car as soon as you can to explore the daily market, high street shops, pubs and cafes. Look harder and you\''ll find second-hand bookshops, antique stores and historic churches. Ride a punt along the river, or tour by foot or open-topped bus. Nearby parks are ideal for picnicking, so pack the Frisbee.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The City Edge</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The village of Grantchester, immortalized in Rupert Brooke\''s poem, is a 45-minute walk south along the River Cam. It can also be reached by punt (or road). If the quiet charm isn\''t attraction enough, the village is well served by pubs and the famous Orchard tearooms. Go from the Great War of Brooke\''s poetry to the Second World War; a 15-minute bicycle ride west of the city leads to the American Military Cemetery in Madingley. Row upon row of white crosses against the peaceful green countryside have a tragic beauty. The more energetic can follow the 25.7-kilometer (16-mile) riverside footpath from Cambridge to Ely. You\''re barely out of the city before you reach a pub serving meals, and it is here that many curtail their route.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Southern Cambridgeshire</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Expect few surprises from the local geography: hills are few and far between, and much of the land is given over to farming. However, the peaceful villages are attractive and welcoming, as is the picturesque Essex town of Saffron Walden (with nearby Audley End House). Wimpole Hall is set in rolling parkland and has a rare breeds farm. Those aged two to 92 will also enjoy the delights of Shepreth Wildlife Park, Linton Zoo and in Duxford the Imperial War Museum, the country\''s largest civil and military aircraft collection.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Newmarket</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just 21 kilometers (13 miles) to the east of Cambridge lies Newmarket, the home of British horseracing. Visit the National Stud and the National Horseracing Museum or — better still — have a flutter at one of the regular race meetings.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ely and the Fens</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For centuries, the region north of Cambridge was untamed by man — treacherous marshes separated isles of higher ground. Drainage has changed this, leaving a flat landscape crisscrossed by rivers and canals, and the dark peat testifies to the fertility of the soil. Wicken Fen shows the marshes as they were, with nature trails leading through reed beds. For centuries, humans struggled to conquer the fenland; now they fight to stop it from disappearing.  Anglesey Abbey became a private home and Denny Abbey became a nunnery. Both are now open to the public. Beside Denny Abbey, a farmland museum recalls the lost rural lifestyle of the last century.  Ely Cathedral — the ship of the Fens — stands proud of its flat surroundings, one of England\''s great Norman cathedrals. The town at its feet has a bustling Thursday market.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Huntingdon and St Ives</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Oliver Cromwell, who led the Roundheads against the Cavaliers of Charles II and become Lord Protector of England following the Civil War, was born in Huntingdon in 1599.

Large hotels began to flourish, offering complete services and amenities, abounding in luxury and exclusivity. This also applied to shopping centers, which started incorporating some of the finest boutiques, jewelers and restaurants. These factors boosted the area\''s status. Already considered a paradise of sun and sea for the color of its waters, the delicate beauty of its powdered sand beaches and the exuberant vegetation of its ecological reserves, Cancún was still improving its reputation.  Cancún can be divided into three main areas: The Hotel District, the Town, and the Ecological Reserve, blessed with incredible lakes and mangrove swamps.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

If you are creature of the night, enjoy partying, live music and staying up all night having fun, Cancún offers a wide variety of choices as to what you can do until the early hours of the morning. If you\''re into club atmospheres, the best options in Cancún are Cocobongo, The City and Daddy\''O.  If what you are really after is good live music venues, the Hard Rock Café is an obvious option, offering the best rock and roll in town. You are bound to take back memories of Mexico\''s music, people and relentless mood for partying. Admission prices vary, but most of the discos and clubs include drinks in the price. What to wear? Generally, people dress quite casually in bars, although they do tend to dress up a little more in discos. With all of the color and variety that exists in this paradise, the possibility of a boring night is impossible. Enjoy your stay, and get dancing! ¡<em>Buen provecho</em>!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Historical Sights</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many points of interest are around Cancún for those that want to adventure outside of the main district. Excursions are easy to reach from the majority of hotels. The archaeological ruins of the lost Mayan civilization at Chichen Itzá are located 200 kilometers (124 miles) away from the island (three hours by bus). The renowned Tulum Archeological Zone is nearby and well worth a visit, as is the Mayan site of Cobá. Isla Mujeres is a natural and exotic sanctuary with great opportunities to snorkel and only five miles from the island. A visit to the ecological and archaeological park of Xcaret is a must, offering underground rivers and caves, a dip with the dolphins or an evening multimedia show recounting Mayan history. A few hours from Cancún by car, you will be at Playa del Carmen, Puerto Aventuras and also Xel-Ha, a natural aquarium where snorkeling and swimming are the main activities. For the intrepid spirit and jungle explorer, excursions are available to the Sian Ka\''an Biosphere Reserve to discover native wildlife or mangrove swamps in this semi-virgin place.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Arts & Culture</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you are a rodeo enthusiast or would like to battle a bull without the fear of being trampled upon, go on to the Plaza de Toros, where events are offered every Wednesday at 3p from December through April. For the adventurous, travel out to the Centro Ceremonial Kohunlich, an area of immense beauty and a place to see Mayan ruins underground. On the other hand, stay indoors and visit the Interactive Aquarium Cancún, where you can feed some sharks and swim with the dolphins. You can also visit INAH Museum which is a Anthropology and History museum that changes its exhibits often. The Museo Maya de Cancun offers insight into the region\''s rich Mayan legacy while at the Museo Sensorial del Tequila you get to learn all about Mexico\''s favorite drink.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals & Celebrations</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you happen to be in Cancún during September, you should definitely not miss the Autumn Equinox at Chichén Itzá, one of the greatest architectural achievements from the Maya and a chance to witness one of their religious and cosmological ideas. The Day of the Dead in the beginning of November is another festival that celebrates the dead, in which they return from the afterlife in order to celebrate and re-join the living. A holiday tradition that has been held for over a thousand years with decorations, parades and mariachis throughout the streets. Another day that honors the origin of the Mexican people is the Día de la Raza, where they celebrate the arrival of Columbus and the recognition of the <em>mestizo</em>, that is, the descendants from mixed European and indigenous indians. There are workshops, folkloric dance, concerts, dining, among many other events, needless to say, September may be the best month to visit Cancún.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports & Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The whole family can enjoy some great activities and attractions that are perfect for every age. For a real lift, let go and fly a kite from the vantage point of Dolphin Beach Viewpoint. You can also have an emotional and memorable experience by swimming with dolphins at the Xcaret Ecological Park, which will leave any traveler with something to write home about. Also try kayaking, skating or cycling along the Ciclopista. Aquatic sports for the entire family are offered at Aquaworld. Another option for adults include the Club de Golf Cancún located on Kukulcán Boulevard.  You can also go horseback riding on the coast for those that love horses, wind sailing, or go snorkeling into the coral reefs (specialized instructors are available for inexperienced divers), go fishing, or ride a jet-ski at high speed, these are just some of the activities that are within reach of those that would like to enhance their stay in Cancun. In the outskirts of Punta Cancún there is the natural aquarium Xel-Ha, where you can snorkel with an amazing variety of species. Towards the south is the Sian Ka\''an Biosphere Reserve, where you can explore forests and a mangrove swamp. Pay attention and listen to the sound of the birds and enjoy watching the small mammals coming out to have a good look at what\''s going on.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In Cancun, there are around 200 restaurants and more than 400 stores in exclusive shopping centers nearby the hotel zone. La Isla Shopping Village and Plaza Las Americas are ideal for international and high street labels, while the Luxury Avenue Cancun caters to those with designer fashion on their mind. For bargain hunters the Las Plazas Outlet Cancun is a great choice and if you\''re looking for an authentic Mexican market experience, Mercado 28 is hard to beat. Besides, there are a number of smaller boutiques selling local crafts and specialty goods that cater to tourists.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Movie lovers will be pleased to find the latest releases offered at the 10 fully equipped theaters in the plush cinema complex Cinemark, located in La Isla Shopping Center. Most of the large commercial complexes have a cinema showing Hollywood films alongside local releases.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (469,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hotel District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Hotel District is comprised of the so-called <em>gran turismo</em> hotels (four-and five-star luxury hotels). Hotels and shopping centers are distributed along the main Boulevard Kuculkán, which runs the length of the 21-kilometer (13-mile) island. This district undoubtedly generates the greatest revenue and has the greatest economic impact on the nation, as compared to the rest of the state. This area is where the trendiest, most popular discos, the finest international restaurants and the largest entertainment venues are situated. Among the top sights in this zone, the Playa Delfines, La Isla Shopping Village, Dolphinaris Cancun, and Museo Maya de Cancun stand out.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Town of Cancún</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Town of Cancún changes the scenery, albeit not too drastically. Peaceful provincial life here is more picturesque, folkloric and the simplicity of some of the shops provides a stark contrast to the million-dollar hotel chains. Restaurants in this district serve typical local food and snacks, providing a real opportunity to taste some genuine homemade Mexican dishes. There are also a lot of shopping opportunities in town. For additional entertainment, theaters and cinemas are located on the main streets. El Parque de las Palapas is a great place to observe a slice-of-life snapshot of the city while Market 28 is the best place to soak in the sights and sounds of an authentic Mexican market first hand. If you\''re in the mood to shop, the Plaza Las Americas with its brand-name stores and plethora of restaurants is a great pick.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sian Ka\''an Biosphere Reserve</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Last, but certainly not least, the third district is in the Sian Ka\''an Biosphere Reserve where nature still reigns supreme in the history of this area. Occupying hundreds of kilometers, it constitutes Mexico\''s largest genuine ecosystem, home to a diverse number of plant and animal species. The government and non-profit organizations do their best to preserve this area as a wildlife refuge containing many species in danger of extinction.  Archaeological sites can be found in the vicinity, extending towards the four cardinal points. Structures tell the history of the settlements of the Mayan people on this peninsula, and just about every rock reveals traces of the historical and cultural legacy which these inhabitants left behind.  Cancún combines the elegance and gamut of entertainment choices in its Hotel District, the traditions and serenity of its <em>pueblo</em>, and the natural beauty of its ecological reserve, coral reef and history of its peoples.

The city center is composed of three very different landscapes — the prestigious seaside promenade, La Croisette, the lively town center overflowing with boutiques, and the picturesque old port and Suquet hill which make up the old town. In the same style as Le Suquet, but 2 miles (4 kilometers) or so north of the town, Le Cannet is a delightful little village of narrow, winding streets and old houses belonging to the town\''s suburbs. Bordering the town to the east is La Californie-Super Cannes, a lush, green haven sheltering luxury villas. On the western side, the suburbs engulf Cannes La Bocca and heading south, you\''ll reach two green gems afloat in the sea — less than a mile from Cannes\'' shores, Iles Sainte-Marguerite and Saint-Honorat attract thousands of visitors every year.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (477,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Galleries, Museums & Monuments</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cannes boasts a number of art galleries that rival any in France, such as the fine contemporary displays at Galerie de Cannes. The Galerie du Carlton is also a splendid avenue to peruse the works of both local and international artists, especially sculpture and intricate glassware. On Rue Grande, the Galerie Gantois is known for its collection of post-impressionist paintings, while the Villa Domergue showcases the outstanding legacy of art left behind by French painter Jean-Gabriel Domergue.  The handful of museums in the town, while few in number, are of uniformly high quality. On Boulevard de la Croisette, you\''ll love to linger around Malmaison, a former private mansion dating back to the belle époque, featuring some excellent temporary art exhibitions. At the summit of Le Suquet — the old town on the hill — stands Musée de la Castre, a museum which boasts a panoramic view of the city and its surroundings, as well as collections focusing on Mediterranean archeology and musical instruments from all over the world. Just next door is the church of Notre-Dame de l\''Espérance with its intriguing commemorative plaques made by locals giving thanks to the Virgin Mary for prayers answered.  Make sure you cross the shores to the island of Sainte-Marguerite, where you can visit the actual prison where the well-known <em>Man in the Iron Mask</em> was held. Incarcerated without trial by order of King Louis XIV, the true identity of this prisoner is still a mystery which continues to puzzle historians. Also on the island is a significant collection of nautical pieces at the Musée de la Mer.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoors</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To begin with the white, sandy beaches, they may not be the biggest in the world, but they certainly have their advantages. Many of them, like Plage du Martinez and Plage du Carlton, are private, which means they offer every imaginable service, from sun beds, umbrellas and refreshments to water skiing, parasailing, and jetskis for hire. And the water is of course blissfully warm, at least in the summer. There is a smattering of public beaches that provide traveling families an atmospheric experience along the Côte d\''Azur, the most popular among them being the Plage de la Bocca and the Plage du Midi in Cannes\'' western stretch.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After a long day of sunbathing and relaxation, it\''s time to dance the night away in one of Cannes\''s nightclubs or unwind in relaxed bliss at one of its many bars. From the cocktail-soaked allure of Chrystie on Rue Macé, and the lavish elegance of Le Bar L\''Amiral at Boulevard de la Croisette, to the glitzy celeb culture at the Gotha Club, Cannes features a host of glamorous picks. The Cotton Club, nestled within the Auberge Provençale da Bouttau, is a beautifully vintage jazz lounge that hosts live music on Fridays and Saturdays. A few wine bars like Le Bar à Vin and L\''Enoteca go a long way in sating oenophiles\'' fantasies.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cannes is retail heaven for shopaholics who will never tire of the countless boutiques on Rue d\''Antibes and Boulevard de la Croisette. These uber-chic shopping zones, with luxury French labels like Chanel, Dior, Trabaud and Dolce & Gabbana never fail to enrapture. If you\''re looking for some chic but affordable new clothes, then Zara and Façonnable are good places to start. It is also definitely worth exploring the vibe and atmosphere at the Marché Forville, a morning market in Le Suquet, where everything from local delicacies, to flowers, cheese and organic culinary items are on offer. Rue Meynadier, near the same neighborhood, is a historic gem and a pedestrianized avenue brimming with vibrant food shops, relatively affordable boutiques and local gift shops.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Given that you\''re in a film buff\''s paradise — the International Film Festival has been running in Cannes for over 50 years — you might just want to catch a movie. Cannes hasn\''t yet been kitted out with enormous multiplexes, but the main local cinemas — Les Arcades and Olympia — are all fantastically placed in the center of town. Studio 13 is also well worth a visit; it shows classics, writer/director films and other movies that fall outside the commercial sphere.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Don\''t forget that Cannes hosts festivals all year round: the world-renowned International Film Festival and the MIDEM (Marché International du Disque, de l\''Edition Musicale) music festival are just a few of the events held here annually. If you\''re in town in September don\''t miss the Festival de la Plaisance (Pleasure Boat Festival).</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (478,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">La Croisette and La Pointe-Croisette</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A visit to Cannes is not complete without a stroll along La Croisette, a splendid promenade that stretches the whole length of Cannes\'' coastline. The atmosphere of this fabulous walkway changes with each passing hour. One minute you\''ll be surrounded by crowds of tourists, the next you\''ll meet a local walking his or her dog, while other times you\''ll pass wealthy, elegantly-dressed residents, or even eccentrics and street artists vying for the attention of passers-by; but before 10a, when the town is still quiet, the atmosphere will take you back to the belle époque. Beneath the promenade, many sandy beaches stretch out to sea. Most of them are private, which means you have to pay to gain access, but your money will buy you the comfort of a sun bed, parasol, and drinks at the bar. The commercial side of La Croisette is largely devoted to illustrious fashion boutiques where the big names in haute couture and jewelery (such as Dior, Hermès, Chanel) rub shoulders with the countless sun-drenched café terraces. Also in this area is the Musée de la Malmaison, a former lavish casino and now a museum showing temporary exhibitions of modern art, looking out over the sea. This is also the site of Cannes\'' most prestigious and palatial hotels, including the famous: Hôtel Intercontinental Carlton and the Grand Hyatt Cannes Hôtel Martinez, home to many film stars during the International Film Festival. During the festival, fans of the silver screen can see the stars and directors making their mark on the famous steps of the Palais des Festivals at the end of La Croisette.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Le Centre-ville (Town Center)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The long shopping street known as Rue d\''Antibes, running parallel to the shore-hugging Boulevard de la Croisette, marks the very heart of the town center as Cannes\'' commercial hub. Fashion boutiques abound, and there\''s something to suit all tastes and budgets, although most of the big-name labels are located on La Croisette. You\''ll find almost all the essentials here: food, the train station, libraries, not to mention it\''s a great place to shop.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Le Vieux Port & Le Suquet (The Old Port & The Hill)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Far from the opulence and modernity of Cannes, the old port and adjoining Suquet district are the most picturesque parts of town, taking you back in time. It\''s easy to lose your way among the elaborate labyrinth of back streets, quaint passageways and pretty little squares, but they are refreshingly cool retreats in the summer heat. Climb the streets to reach the top of the Suquet hill, from where you can take in an unrivaled panorama of Cannes and the surrounding area. It makes for an especially romantic view as dusk falls and the town begins to light up beneath you. Just behind this point is one of Cannes\'' few museums, the Musée de la Castre, sheltered in a 12th-century castle which once belonged to the monks of the Lérins islands just offshore. It houses a beautiful collection of objects of Mediterranean origin, with an emphasis on ethnography and archeology, as well as many musical instruments from all over the world. Also on Le Suquet is the Eglise Notre-Dame d\''Espérance, a Gothic-style church dating back to the 17th Century. The church is especially renowned for its naïve-style thanksgiving plaques created by locals as a tribute to the Virgin Mary, who answered their prayers. As for the old port, its moorings are only occupied by yachts and small fishing boats. But Cannes is a master at harmonizing contrasts: old lives beside new, luxury mingles with rustic, and the town and countryside happily complement one another here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Le Cannet-Rocheville</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Let the long, wide Boulevard Carnot leads you to the peaceful and pleasant suburb of Cannet with its picturesque architecture, where the tiny old town resembles a little inland village. The district boasts many art and crafts galleries, a chapel decorated by Tobiasse—a celebrated painter from Israel who lives on the Côte d\''Azur, as well as a bunch of great little restaurants.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">California & Super-Cannes</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Situated on a small hill, the California district is blessed with many beautiful green areas. The Mediterranean flora is in bloom all year long, featuring aloes, mimosas, pine and cork-oak trees, and the area actually owes its name, California, to this vegetation which evokes western America. The town\''s most beautiful houses and hotels were built here during the belle époque, and although little of them remain today, this is still a high-class area. The villas are sumptuously luxurious, lavishly brimming with wealth and finery, although it\''s often difficult to catch a glimpse of them as they are usually hidden amongst extensive grounds.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">La Bocca</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Situated just to the west of Cannes, close to the motorway and the Cannes-Mandelieu airport, the Cannes-La Bocca district doesn\''t have much to offer the tourist. That said, it does have a large number of superstores selling sports gear, furniture and the like.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Îles de Lérins (The Lérins Islands)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">These two sparkling emeralds set off the coast of Cannes go by the names of Sainte-Marguerite and Saint-Honorat. Far from the hustle and bustle of the town, the islands seem to look on Cannes with an assured and peaceful air. Adventuring into the natural beauty of the islands is a very popular pursuit during the summer months. To get there, take one of the boats which depart near the Palais des Festivals. It was on the island of Sainte-Marguerite that the \"Man in the Iron Mask\", made famous by Alexandre Dumas, was kept for eleven years, (although the mask was in fact made of velvet). In addition to the vegetation, the monastery on Saint-Honorat is well worth a visit.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

These streams of history flow together in the city but, particularly because of the legacy of the apartheid system, visitors to Cape Town are often amazed by the dramatic contrasts that remain between different areas. Nature, too, creates very different sub-climates around the mountain so the vegetation varies a great deal, as of course do the vistas. The city, however, is connected by fast freeways. Thus, twenty minutes from the wine farms of the leafy Constantia valley you could be on a beach, in the bustling city center or in a shanty township. It is truly fascinating to discover the different areas and experience the diversity of culture in the city.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The historical Bo-Kaap Museum steals the limelight with its colorful legacy, and features quaint streets, a row of vibrant houses and a unique air of nostalgia. The Aquarium (in the Waterfront) is superb and highly recommended. The Castle is the oldest building in South Africa and has the excellent William Fehr art collection. The impressive Groot Constantia estate has a grand Manor House that is well worth a visit. Robben Island is now a heritage site; it was formerly a prison for political activists including Nelson Mandela. Other notable museums include the South African Jewish Museum in the City Centre, the District Six Museum, and the Chavonnes Cannon Battery Museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the best places to admire art is the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa, a dazzling repository of modern art located on the V&A Waterfront. The South African National Gallery in Company\''s Garden and the Irma Stern Museum also house exceptional collections of regional artwork. Small galleries are also found in most shopping malls. In-Fin-Art on Wolfe Street is a good place to start.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinemas screening mainstream flicks are located in the shopping malls such as Cavendish Square in Claremont and the Waterfront. One exception is the Labia, an old cinema and landmark in Gardens, which showcases independent art films in its four-screen complex.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater & Concerts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are two main theater complexes: the Baxter in Rondebosch and the Artscape on the foreshore. They feature the full range of theater, dance and music. The standard and appeal are variable. During the summer there are excellent concerts at the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden on Sundays (take a picnic) and the Spier Estate in the Winelands. The Theatre on the Bay in Camps Bay is home to light comedy and thrillers. A couple of dinner theaters are located along the Green Point area, such as the Rockwell Dinner Theatre, the Kalk Bay Theatre, and the Stardust Theatrical Dining in Woodstock.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Jazz</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cape Town has a strong passion for jazz, but there are remarkably few regular venues that are easy to get to. The The Crypt Jazz Restaurant in City Centre, the Kloof Street House and the Kaleidoscope Cafe hold regular jazz sessions.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To find hip night venues try the Shimmy Beach Club on the waterfront, or head to ThirtyOne, an upscale club located on the 31st floor of the Absa Centre. Others like the Jade Lounge & Champagne Bar, the Chez Ntemba Nightclub and Fiction Music Bar are also worth exploring.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (496,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Atlantic Seaboard</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Camps Bay, Bantry Bay, Llandudno and Clifton are the suburbs of foreign house prices. The impressive apartment blocks built into the mountain sides and the old cottages above the fabulous Clifton Beaches have been snapped up by overseas buyers. Expect to see jet skis on the roof garages. Clifton is very sheltered and the perfect place for a picnic at sunset. Camps Bay is picturesque and there are some excellent restaurants and cafés. This is the place to hang out and be cool, but you will be very cool indeed if you try to swim in the sea; the arctic currents don\''t know they\''ve reached Africa.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Waterfront</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The old docks have been excellently converted into the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, a very large complex of hotels, restaurants and bars, shops (galore), cinemas, two craft markets and the Two Oceans Aquarium. Here you will also find numerous companies offering boat trips, including the Robben Island Ferry, and fun things such as jet skis and helicopter trips. It is a very easy and secure place with lots to do; although you can find most things cheaper elsewhere, especially jewelery.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">City Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">All the diversity of Cape Town is meshed into the city center. It is a surprisingly small area and is best covered on foot - but be prepared to fend off hawkers and some street children. Keep your wits and your wallet about you and don\''t stay out after dark. St. George\''s Mall and Greenmarket Square are the undisputed heart of Cape Town; abuzz with vibes, sounds and crafts of Africa, all mixed up with European heritage. In contrast, The Company Gardens are beautifully peaceful and historically very interesting: Take a walk along Government Avenue, past Parliament, and spend some time in the South African Museum; it is great fun. The Mount Nelson Hotel is at the top—the perfect place for high tea.  It is worth driving around the Grand Parade: The Castle of Good Hope and the City Hall are important buildings, and Adderley Street also has many of the grandest buildings in Cape Town. Just above the city center is the Bo-Kaap—see the brightly colored homes and notice the Malay influences.  At night, the center empties out of all but street people; it is best seen by day. The exception is the top of Long Street which is abuzz with nightlife, and the cafés and restaurants of upper Kloof Street nearby in Gardens.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Southern Suburbs, Constantia & Hout Bay</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you love rugby or cricket head for Newlands. There is a large, up-market shopping center nearby in Claremont, Cavendish Square for those looking to shop. On the mountain slopes you will find the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, a definite \"must see.\" Around the corner is Constantia; here are some historic and wonderful wine farms (such as Groot Constantia and Klein Constantia), a very impressive shopping mall and some of the best restaurants in the country. There is an extensive walking trail across the Constantia valley.  On the other side of the mountain explore Hout Bay. The fishermen in the harbor are a highly spirited bunch. You can take sea trips from here (see the seals on Duiker Island). If the Chapman\''s Peak drive is open, it is a must-do.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The South Peninsula</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The south peninsula is mountainous and largely a National Park plus some very charming seaside towns, notably the very British Simon\''s Town, the fishing village at Kalk Bay, gorgeous Noordhoek and Kommetijie and rustic Scarborough. The beaches are fabulous (and the penguins think so, too); check out the little guys at Boulders Beach near Simon\''s Town. The water is much warmer on the eastern side of the peninsula. Cape Point and its massive Nature Reserve are within easy reach and it is worth taking some time to explore the reserve. For a famous picture stop go to the colorful beach huts at St James and Muizenberg.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Winelands</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The winelands are an extensive area of wine and fruit farms in a mountain setting less than an hour from Cape Town. There is a certain charm and dignity to the area and some very pretty towns. There are many wine farms, in all styles and sizes, but the taste and price are bound to please. Check out a variety of big and small wine farms in different areas, but beware of weekend closing. Don\''t miss the restaurants of Franschhoek and spending time exploring the great beauty of Stellenbosch.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Townships</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To get some valuable insight into South Africa\''s political history and cultural diversity take a township tour (specialist companies include African Dawn and Grassroutes). For many people this turns out to be the unexpected high point of their visit to Cape Town; the resilience, enterprise and hope of these communities is very inspiring and the stories of the past are a sobering insight into social planning gone awry. It is not recommended that you try to tour the townships on your own; take an organized tour with a specialist company.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Northern Suburbs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Predominantly Afrikaans, modern and suburban, these areas lie along the N1 freeway. The classic view of Table Mountain is best viewed from Blouberg. Century City is set to rival the Waterfront as Cape Town\''s major leisure complex. The Durbanville Hills may of interest to wine enthusiasts and the Tygervalley Center for those who love to shop.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Every day you can find some sort of cultural activity and, particularly at the weekend, Caracas\'' talented artists show off their creativity, to the many <em>Caraqueños</em> and travelers who are out and about. There are always a number of cultural centers with something on. Some of the places where you can get a good idea of what Venezuelan art has to offer are the Museum of Contemporary Art and the National Art Gallery. The Ateneo de Caracas and the Quinta Anauco are some of the places that display a tremendous amount of Venezuelan art as well.  The museums of Caracas are distinguished by their beauty and magnificence, not only in architecture, but also the artifacts exhibited inside.  The Children\''s Museum, a family-friendly museum that encourages learning through active science and technological displays is a popular spot to visit in the city. The Museum of Natural Sciences also follows a similar pattern. The Museo Bolíviariano, a venerated spot dedicated to the importance of the Latin American independence at the heart of which was Simón Bolívar, is one of the best museums in the city. Other smaller museums include the Carlos Cruz Díez Museum, a stunning repository of more than 2500 printing and design-related objects, the 17th Century Casa Natal del Libertador Simón Bolívar that housed the great revolutionary, the Transport Museum and the Arturo Michelena Museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When it comes to theaters there also is a great variety to choose from. One of the most famous theater groups is Sala Rajatabla, which stages its plays at the Ateneo de Caracas. Other theaters well worth a visit are the National Theater, a favored spot for traditional <em>zarzuelas, </em>or theatrical, opera-like performances that alternate between music and drama, and the Foundación Celarg that hosts an excellent performing arts program. The El Teatro Municipal is one of the city\''s oldest opera houses, although it is no longer the home of the national opera. This honor now belongs to the Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex, that houses two concert halls - José Félix Ribas and the Ríos Reyna - and is also home to the Venezuela Symphony Orchestra. The Teatro Municipal however, does host the Municipal Symphony Orchestra of Caracas.   The two best places to enjoy classical, lyric chants, chamber music, latin, jazz and Venezuelan music are the Complejo Cultural Teresa Carreño, the Centro de Cultura Corp Banca and the Aula Magna located within the Central University of Venezuela. Every month each presents a recital from symphonic orchestras and guests from abroad.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightclubs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While nightlife in Caracas may not be what it used to be, Caracas has found methods to entertain its denizens. Find local bars like Juan Sebastián that serenade visiting crowds with jazz performances, or Le Club, one of the city\''s oldest and most premier clubs that operates between Thursday and Saturday. The Buddha Bar Caracas, located in the city\''s prime neighborhood for nightlife, Las Mercedes, is also wildly popular among the city\''s well-heeled lot. If you love a good dose of quirkiness, the Hog Heaven will serve you well. A funky motorcycle bar, this atmospheric spot is great for mingling with locals, listening to live music, or unwinding with a beer on its patio. The 360º Roof Bar is also a good option.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

El Silencio proudly showcases Venezuela\''s rich history, with architectural gems from the 17th and 18th Centuries. This part of Caracas is well worth a visit. Places such as Plaza Bolívar and the Catedral Metropolitana de Caracas, a 1665 structure, form some of its main landmarks. Other notable structures, longstanding vestiges of the city and country\''s treasured heritage include the Casa Natal El Libertador, the house where Simón Bolívar, the Liberator, was born and the 17th century La Casa Amarilla, once a prison, but now used by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The El Capitolio Nacional, seat of the legislative council, the Teatro Nacional, and the El Panteón Nacional, the resting place for prominent Venezuelans are also located here. While enjoying a sightseeing tour in the downtown area, prized architectural landmarks such as the Basílica de Santa Teresa, the El Palacio de Miraflores, which is the presidential palace, and the Museo Arturo Michelena, should not be forgotten.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parque Central Complex</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Home to innovation, architecture, art and culture, and the country\''s two highest towers - if there is any place that shows how modern Caracas is, it is El Parque Central. Located less than a few kilometers to the southeast of La Plaza Bolívar, the park contains a concrete structure with two 53-floor octagonal towers and residential buildings. However, if it is not architecture and structural designs, but rather culture that takes your interest, you will be pleasantly surprised to find a great number of art centers here. In the Complejo Cultural Teresa Carreño, the arts reach their utmost expression, through theater, dance, concerts and ballet performances among others.  You will find a large concentration of museums in this area, all located within walking distance of one another. The The Museum of Contemporary Art in Caracas, a contemporary art museum, and the Museo de los Niños where adults as well as children will find enjoyment surround the Parque Los Cabos. Museo de Ciencias Naturales, the Museum of Fine Arts, and the Galería de Arte Nacional, a landmark art institution which possesses a permanent collection of more than 3,500 works of art are also located in the vicinity. Nearby is the immense Botanical Garden, and the Ateneo de Caracas, where you will find a cinema, theaters, an art gallery, a cafeteria and a bookstore. To the south of the Botanical Gardens, you will find the largest university in Caracas, the Universidad Central de Venezuela.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sabana Grande & Las Mercedes</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Even though this is not quite a tourist mecca, here we will find the famous Sabana Grande Boulevard, more than three-quarters of a mile and surrounded by shops, hotels and restaurants. The neighborhood of Las Mercedes is one of the most busy and popular areas in the city. It is characterized as being the center of fashion and Caracas\'' nightlife. Here you will be able to enjoy yourself, go to a good restaurant or to a classy nightclub, all in the same area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Altamira, Chacao & El Hatillo</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Altamira is one of the most pleasant neighborhoods in the city, which normally includes some smaller districts such as La Castellana, Los Palos Grandes, Bello Campo and La Floresta. It is an important business area and is the location of the Plaza Francia which has a large obelisk, a monumental trademark of Caracas. Chacao is a district teeming with corporate towers and skyscrapers, strewn amid which are various shopping centers such as the Centro Comercial Sambil Chacao. El Hatillo is ideal for those that may want to escape the hustle and bustle from the city.

 (536,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Uptown / City Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Known for its fine dining and great nightlife, skyscrapers line the streets and provide a \"big city\" feel to this charming Southern metropolis. If you\''re visiting Charlotte during football or basketball season, be sure to grab tickets for a Carolina Panthers game at Bank of America Stadium or a Charlotte Hornets game at Spectrum Center.

Concord is considered the center of NASCAR with 90 percent of the official NASCAR racing teams located within just 50 miles (80 kilometers) of the Oval.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Myers Park</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The 1920s construction boom brought the commuter neighborhood of Myers Park, which is home to some of Charlotte\''s oldest houses. Lacking the usual grid design, the oak tree-lined avenues of Myers Park are curved to match the landscape, giving it a unique, relaxed feel. Myers Park was originally a \"streetcar suburb\" because of the electric trolley that brought commuters to and from work. This same trolley still provides quick and efficient travel, making this highly desirable Charlotte neighborhood easily accessible.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">NoDa</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">NoDa, named for a section of North Davidson Street, is Charlotte\''s equivalent to NYC\''s SoHo neighborhood.

Today those buildings have either been revamped or replaced by a number of restaurants, offices, shops and condominiums. These attractions are easily accessible via the Charlotte Trolley, whose origins can be traced back to this particular section of Charlotte.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dilworth</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The true-blue neighborhood feel of this Charlotte district makes it one of the more desirable areas in which to live. As with most sections of Charlotte, Dilworth is historically and architecturally significant. Just outside of the city limits, Dilworth was a \"streetcar suburb\" as well. Houses here date back to the early 1900s, and their architecture goes well with the tree-lined streets of the neighborhood. Businesses here fit right into the history-laden scheme of things as well.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Elizabeth</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Elizabeth is yet another Charlotte neighborhood steeped in history. Originally named after Elizabeth College, an all-girls\'' Lutheran university, Elizabeth began to rapidly evolve around the turn of the 20th Century. During that period, the completion of a trolley line transformed this particular part of Charlotte into a readily accessible section of the city. When one thinks of Elizabeth, they also tend to think of Independence Park. This was the first public park in the city of Charlotte. On most sunny days, and maybe some not-so-sunny days, this is where you\''ll find Elizabeth residents enjoying the fresh North Carolina air. Like it was back in its heyday, Elizabeth remains a very fashionable part of Charlotte. This is reflected in the businesses and restaurants located within the district. Some of the more notable establishments include such restaurants like Carpe Diem and the Cajun Queen.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ballantyne</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Located on the south side of Charlotte is the area known as Ballantyne. In recent decades, this part of the city has been blessed with some heavy growth. Ballantyne homes are beautifully structured and historically significant to the city as a whole. This is yet another neighborhood in Charlotte that has done well by mixing the old and the new. Amidst the age-old residential parts of Ballantyne are new restaurants like the Cajun Yard Dog, bars like Arooji\''s, and businesses like the Dana Rader Golf School. Indeed, if golf is your thing, this is the neighborhood for you, what with the Golf Club at Ballantyne Resort and Olde Sycamore Golf Plantation right around the way.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Nowadays, most <em>muay</em> Thai matches are held in Western-style boxing arenas, watched by people from all walks of life rooting for (and betting on) their favorite fighters. A dance-like ritual initiates each fight, with musical accompaniment from a small orchestra. This symbolizes the fighters\'' gratitude to the spirits and their prayer for strength and courage. The fighting itself looks codified but brutal, involving free-for-all kicks and elbow blows to the body and face. You can watch <em>muay</em> Thai at Gawila Boxing Stadium, where boxers from all over Thailand compete, usually at 7.30p on weekend nights. You can also see less compelling exhibitions of <em>muay</em> Thai at a small stadium on Loi Kroh, near the Night Bazaar.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Khantoke / Dinner / Dance</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A traditional <em>khantoke</em> dinner is a sumptuous occasion. Diners sit on cushions while elegantly attired attendants serve them a variety of appetizers, salads, curries and rice dishes. During the meal, traditional Thai dancers entertain the guests with fluid, graceful performances using enormous fans and other props.

Drunken Flower is a popular hang-out for local university students. Just about any bar in Chiang Mai has karaoke. There are numerous karaoke clubs across the street from Kad Suan Kaew.

Chiang Mai is much smaller than Bangkok and, even if you are unfamiliar with maps, it is fairly easy to find your way around. Perhaps the best place to start is the old city. This central part of Chiang Mai is contained within four walls and a moat, originally built for defense purposes. The walls date back to the city\''s founding in the 13th Century but were rebuilt in the 19th Century. Several of the original gates in the wall have also been restored and serve as useful reference points to help you find your way around. Particularly interesting is the busy Tha Pae Gate. Around this area there are a plethora of restaurants and cafes. Several small hotels also dot the vicinity (for example Lai-Thai Guesthouse, Roong Ruang Hotel and Gap\''s House. Within the old city runs a maze of roads. Taking a walk around some of these quiet lanes can be a pleasure in itself. You will come across Chiang Mai\''s most interesting temples, starting with Wat Pan On, which stands close to Tha Pae Gate. Farther into the old city you will find others, including Wat Chedi Luang, Wat Phra Singh and Wat Chiang Man.  To the east, between Tha Pae Gate and the Mae Ping River, lie the main business and shopping areas. Perhaps the most popular of these is Chang Klan Road, home to the increasingly popular Night Bazaar. Here you can find a variety of crafts and other local products. If shopping makes you weary, take a respite in one of the restaurants that line the streets here. There are some good hotels in the area, too. East of Chang Klan Road, at the corner of Nawarat Bridge along the Mae Ping River, is the Municipal Tourist Information Center. A little further up river are a major post office and Warorot Market, a bustling market selling a diversity of northern food as well as cheap clothing. As you cross Narawat Bridge, Tha Pae Road becomes Charoen Muang Road. From here you can catch a bus south to the historic old city of Lamphun.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">West</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Side</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The western side of the old city reaches out toward Doi Suthep Mountain and the beautiful white <em>chedis</em> (spires) of Wat Suan Dok. Further on is another beautiful temple, Wat Umong. From the northwest of the city, Huay Keaw Road leads to the top of Doi Suthep mountain. Along this road are Kad Suan Keaw, a popular shopping mall and the sprawling Chiang Mai Zoo. If you come here, be prepared to do a lot of walking, or hire a driver to take you round, as the grounds are very large. Further out is Huay Keaw Waterfall and, at the end of the road, proudly sitting on top of the mountain, is the revered Wat Phra Tat Doi Suthep, an elegant temple looking down over the city of Chiang Mai.  A few kilometers further up Doi Suthep lies Phu Phing Palace, a popular retreat for the royal family. Several quality hotels, such as Chiang Mai Orchid and Holiday Garden Hotel, are also located on the west side of town.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">San</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kampaeng</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Along the road to San Kampaeng (Route 101), handicraft stores line the road. Bor Sang Umbrella Village provides a great place to buy locally produced souvenirs, particularly umbrellas. Beyond Bor Sang lies San Kampaeng, a small market town, and San Kampaeng Hot Springs, a great place for a soak. The countryside around here is beautiful and unspoiled. Northward from the city (along Route 107), you can find Mae Sa Elephant Training Center and Chiang Dao Cave, a place of great natural beauty. If you prefer to stay in this area rather than journey out from Chiang Mai, there are many beautiful resorts to choose from.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outside the City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Other attractions beyond the city limits include hiking and white water rafting as well as incredible natural scenery, such as the awesome Doi Inthanon, the highest peak in Thailand. Many trips outside Chiang Mai can be arranged independently as plenty of buses serve the provinces. Alternatively, book yourself an organized tour. These range from one-day trips around the city to longer excursions incorporating activities such as rafting, hiking or exploring hill tribe villages. An exciting way to get an alternative perspective is from the air. This expensive yet unforgettable option can be arranged by several helicopter tour outfits that operate here.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (563,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art & Architecture</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You cannot talk about art in Chicago without mentioning its architecture, from the modern behemoth that is the Willis Tower to the old Water Tower. Several buildings showcase the Modernist genius of Ludwig Miesvan der Rohe, including the IBM building, the Ralph Metcalf Federal Building, numerous structures on the Illinois Institute of Technology campus, and twin \"glass house\" apartment buildings on Lake Shore Drive. World-renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright designed many of the beautiful buildings that make the city and surrounding suburbs unique; learn more about him with a visit to his Home and Studio in Oak Park. While in the suburb, be sure to see Unity Temple, the Unitarian Church that Wright designed. To gain a thorough understanding of the buildings that surround you, visit the Chicago Architecture Foundation, which offers an array of tours by foot, bus and even water. The River Cruise is highly recommended. Another great place to visit is the Chicago Athenaeum: Museum of Architecture and Design, which offers tours, unique exhibits and a wonderful book and gift store. Art lovers will find plenty of options in this city. An obvious choice is the world-class Art Institute of Chicago, which houses a renowned Impressionist collection. The Museum of Contemporary Art and the Terra Museum of American Art are other good bets. For a more hands-on arts experience, you will not want to miss the summer\''s 57th Street Art Fair in Hyde Park on the South Side. It is a delightful way to view and purchase original works by local artists. Finally, don\''t miss dipping in and out of Chicago\''s myriad galleries. River North is a good place to start. You\''ll find Carl Hammer Gallery, Fassbender Gallery, and the Illinois Institute of Art all within a few short blocks of each other.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chicago is a city that\''s high on sports-fueled adrenaline rush. The city is one of the very few to be home to teams that represent all five major American professional team sports i.e. basketball, baseball, hockey, soccer and football. Wrigley Field is the home of the Chicago Cubs while the White Sox play at the Guaranteed Rate Field. Other professional teams include the  Chicago Bulls basketball team, the Chicago Bears football team at the Soldier Field, the Chicago Blackhawks ice hockey team, and the Chicago Fire and Red Stars soccer teams. There are a few minor league teams as well.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Film</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Chicago International Film Festival is one of the country\''s oldest competitive film festivals—a must-see if you happen to be here in the fall. The Navy Pier Imax Theatre is a nice alternative to the standard movie house fare, offering an exciting, panoramic 3-D viewing experience. The Gene Siskel Film Center at the Art Institute of Chicago presents world cinema in a non-commercial context, and hosts a monthly film series. For classic movies in a classic theater, visit the distinctive Music Box Theatre, which shows old films at weekend matinees and foreign and art films in the evening.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chicago is a blues town, with many great blues houses to choose from. Buddy Guy\''s Legends, owned by the legendary bluesman himself, is sure to please. Kingston Mines is one of the oldest venues in the city, but still holds its own with low admission prices. For great jazz, try the Green Mill, a former Al Capone-owned speakeasy where the best and hottest still play. Another good bet is the Jazz Showcase, which brings big-name acts into town. Grant Park offers Blues and Jazz festivals each year. Alternatives to the blues and jazz are provided by the Cubby Bear, which features rock-n-roll acts. For more live rock, don\''t miss the Metro, the Riviera or the Aragon Ballroom. If you\''ve ever wanted to be the performer on stage, then head to the Old Town School of Folk Music, which holds classes as well as public performances. For the more classical side of Chicago, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Lyric Opera are world renowned.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While Chicago\''s nightlife scene is dominated by its many fantastic live music venues and jazz clubs, this city offers a wide array of alternative nighttime venues that are no less enticing. Smart Bar tops the city\''s ist of top-notch dance clubs, hosting live performances by some of the best DJs sourced from the clubs of Europe alongside local legends. The Underground Chicago, Studio Paris, The Mid, Berlin, Primary and Sound-Bar are other acclaimed venues revered as destinations for the hottest DJs, dance parties and trendy confines. The Beauty Bar represents Chicago\''s more eccentric side. Equal parts salon and nightclub, this bar offers manicures, martinis, and dancing. Open until 4a, the East Room is a low-key alternative for after parties and pre-game drinks, while the Apartment is another quirky nightspot that mimics loft parties.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums & Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chicago has a diverse offering of museums. Depending on your length of stay, you will want to take in several of these gems. The Art Institute of Chicago features French Impressionists, an Oriental Collection and great special exhibits. The Adler Planetarium offers a wide array of hands-on exhibits and information about the universe. The Field Museum of Natural History features Sue, the world\''s most complete remains of a T-Rex. The Shedd Aquarium, the world\''s largest indoor aquarium and oceanarium, showcases beluga whales. The mammoth Museum of Science and Industry includes a coal mine, a German U-Boat and a Zephyr, and an old-style steam train, all under one roof.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Increasingly, the Loop has become the place to be for large-scale theater. The Cadillac Palace Theatre joins the ranks of the Ford Center for the Performing Arts-Oriental Theatre, the Auditorium Theatre and the Chicago Theatre for Broadway-style shows. The Goodman Theatre has relocated from the Art Institute to a North Loop site. Some good off-Loop theater options include the Steppenwolf Theater, the Victory Gardens Theater and the Royal George Theatre Center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Comedy</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Second City has launched many a comedian\''s career, especially those of <em>Saturday Night Live</em> fame. Seating is cabaret-style, the drinks are good, and the improv ensemble shows are top-notch hilarious. Zanies is a Chicago standout for stand-up comedy, with occasional appearances by established stars. For unique, off-the-wall productions, try the Neo-Futurarium.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping in Chicago spans the spectrum from small, locally owned boutiques to big-name brand and luxury designer wares. The Magnificent Mile and Streeterville are anchored by department stores like Bloomingdales, Sacs Fifth Avenue and Macy\''s while big-name brand stores are scattered in between. Head to Wicker Park and Bucktown for a wholesome mix of designer boutiques and thrift stores that together make for a veritable haven for the fashion-forward shopper. For high-end brands at bargain prices, the Fashion Outlets of Chicago boast a varied selection of outlet stores. Oak Street is another popular locale for high-end brands while the Water Tower Place, State Street and Woodfield mall other fine alternatives. For original artwork and one-of-a-kind jewelry, check out the art galleries that throng River North and shop at Andersonville\''s flea markets, locally-owned boutiques and the Andersonville Galleria for arts, crafts and other nifty merchandise. For sporting goods and merchandise, Wrigleyville is your best bet.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Those who enjoy the outdoors should spend some time soaking up the sunshine at Chicago\''s beaches. There are also several hiking trails to explore such as the Lakefront Trail, Des Plaines River Trail, and the Great Western Trail.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (564,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Loop<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Loop takes its name from the elevated \"El\" train that<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> circles</span> around the city\''s central core. While the downtown area stretches beyond these boundaries, the real pulse of the city is found in this historic district. The<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower), the United States\'' second-tallest building, is here, as is the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Chicago Board of Trade, one of the biggest options and futures trading centers in the world. City government offices are also located in the area, as well as the home offices of several global corporations.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>When it\''s time for the city that works to relax, the Loop does not disappoint. The city\''s magnificent<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Harold Washington Library, the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago Architecture Foundation<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>and the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Chicago Cultural Center<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>are all here.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Thanks to a thriving theater district, the Loop is growing more and more popular with nearby office workers. The restored<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Ford Center for the Performing Arts-Oriental Theatre<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>hosts lavish Broadway productions while the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> iconic </span>Chicago Theatre<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>has several musical concerts. The landmark<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Auditorium Theatre, considered by some the most beautiful theater in America, hosts musicals, concerts and other performances in the South Loop area. The renowned Goodman Theatre<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>also offers several performances throughout the year. While technically just outside the Loop\''s borders,<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Grant Park<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>is still closely tied to the neighborhood. Hugging Lake Michigan, this park is often referred to as \"Chicago\''s Front Yard.\" The majestic<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Buckingham Fountain<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>is here, as is a plush rose garden and the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Chicago Symphony Orchestra\''s outdoor home -the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Petrillo Music Shell. The park is immense, with the capacity to hold up to three million people, tested annually by the Taste of Chicago festival. Grant Park also plays host to many free music and arts festivals during the summer, including Jazz Fest, Blues Fest and Gospel Fest.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Near North Side<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just to the north of the Loop is Chicago\''s Near North Side neighborhood, a collection of several other smaller districts.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>The city\''s<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>\"Magnificent Mile\"<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>(\"Mag Mile\" to locals) is one of the Near North\''s most famous boulevards. Stretching along Michigan Avenue from the Chicago River to Oak Street, this shopper\''s paradise is home to high-end chains like<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Neiman Marcus<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>and Bloomingdale\''s<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>at the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>900 North Michigan Avenue Shops, as well as lavish boutiques scattered throughout the area along with many fine hotels and restaurants.The<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>John Hancock Center is just down the block from the links to the city\''s past such as the Water Tower and the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Chicago Water Works, two of the few buildings that survived the Great Chicago Fire of 1871.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Water Tower Place, an upscale indoor shopping mall, offers a wide variety of shopping, dining and entertainment options. You can enjoy<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>RL Restaurant, Ralph Lauren\''s hip eatery next to one of the brand\''s largest retail locations.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Nordstrom, Crate & Barrel and Saks Fifth Avenue can be found a few blocks south on Michigan Avenue.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Of course, all these upscale shops need equally upscale shoppers, most of whom live in Streeterville or the adjoining Gold Coast neighborhood. Originally named after John Jacob Aster, the area\''s present moniker describes the area\''s opulence. The neighborhood is the nation\''s second wealthiest, surpassed only by New York City\''s Central Park East.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Just north of the Chicago River and a few blocks west of the Magnificent Mile is River North, home to an eclectic mix of swanky galleries, trendy cafes and theme restaurants like the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Hard Rock Café. The area has the second densest concentration of art galleries in the US, only surpassed by Manhattan.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Loop<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In stark contrast to the opulent skyscrapers and contemporary nightlife, the South Loop offers a quaint, Old World charm, neighborhood bars and small restaurants. Once home to one of the largest publishing centers in the Midwest, the warehouses left behind have been renovated and taken over by young, affluent professionals in walking distance to their jobs in the Loop. The area\''s focal point,<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Dearborn Station, is a stylistic beacon for the neighborhood, the former rail transportation hub\''s façade lavishly restored to its former glory.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beyond Downtown<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lake Shore Drive, one of the city\''s major north-south arteries, runs along the picturesque lakefront. While the Drive will take you to many of the city\''s attractions, this boulevard is a destination in itself. The lake view, the bold skyline, and even the street\''s own tree-lined medians offer some of the most breathtaking views of the city.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lincoln Park<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once you pass North Avenue, you enter Lincoln Park, home to some of the city\''s most beloved attractions. Tree-lined Fullerton Avenue, with its brownstones converted into condos, gives you a feel for the neighborhood\''s character. Lincoln Park also surrounds the DePaul University neighborhood. A variety of bars, dance spots and inexpensive restaurants cater to the college and just-out-of-college crowd.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>The park from which the neighborhood takes its name is one of the city\''s largest and most pastoral. Designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, who also drew up the blueprints for New York\''s Central Park,<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Lincoln Park encompasses more than 1,000 acres. It includes the famous Lincoln Park Zoo, the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Lincoln Park Conservatory, the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, a driving range, dozens of recreational fields, and several biking and running paths linked to lakefront beaches. You\''ll find many pickup games of soccer and ultimate Frisbee here on warm summer days.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lakeview</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Heading further north brings you to Lakeview, a neighborhood that serves as a popular nightlife center for both the straight and gay communities. These groups tend to party separately, with the standout exception being<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Berlin, a late-night dance club where hipsters of every orientation party together.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Halsted Street between Belmont Avenue and Irving Park Road serves as the headquarters for gay nightlife. The area is not hard to find; just look for the gigantic rainbow-colored pylons that line the streets. For dancing, head to<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Roscoe\''s Tavern. Don\''t miss the Center on Halsted, the city\''s premier destination for LGBT cultural and recreational activities, and a wide array of social events throughout the year.If partying is not your thing, don\''t despair. The area also contains its fair share of restaurants, including<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Angelina Ristorante<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>and<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Yoshi\''s Cafe.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>For nightlife without a specific LGBT focus, head a few blocks west to Wrigleyville, a bar neighborhood that gets its name from the nearby<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs. The district\''s numerous taverns here make for excellent bar-hopping, so stop in the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Cubby Bear<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>or<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>The Metro, a bar that features live music and up-and-coming rock bands like the Smashing Pumpkins, who played here before they made it big and returned for their final two shows.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Diners can select from a variety of tastes in Wrigleyville, including Asian, Cajun, Italian and Mexican. Those who prefer to stick with the bar scene can eat well at<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Sluggers.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Uptown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>For more live music, head farther north, where you\''ll find the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Aragon Ballroom, the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Riviera<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>and the prohibition-era jazz bar,<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Green Mill. Some of the best music in the city, be it jazz, rock, and everything in between can be found here.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wicker Park/Bucktown<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A hot spot for artists and partiers is the Wicker Park/Bucktown area. Hang out at bars like the Blue Note<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>and<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Holiday Club<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>or restaurants like Northside Bar & Grill<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>and<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Beat Kitchen<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>to catch up with the hip crowd and find out about what\''s new in the city\''s underground scene.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The South Side<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While Chicago\''s South Side has traditionally been a bit rougher and tumble than the rest of the city, there are tons of attractions that North Siders often forget about.As you cruise south on Lake Shore Drive, admire the Museum Campus where the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Shedd Aquarium,<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Adler Planetarium<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>and the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Field Museum<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>converge. If you have the time, you could easily spend a full day in each museum, but it\''s also well worth a stop just to enjoy the lake views and watch sailboats go by.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Just south, you pass<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Soldier Field, home of the Chicago Bears. After driving past this monumental stadium, you come to sprawling<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>McCormick Place, one of the largest convention centers in North America and home to numerous annual trade shows, like the Chicago Boat, RV & Outdoors Show, and the Chicago Auto Show. The space includes more than 2.2 million square feet of exhibition space, Chicago\''s largest ballroom and the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Arie Crown Theater.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>US Celluar Field, formally known as Comiskey Park (though not the same location as the previous Comiskey Park), home of the<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Chicago White Sox, lies just west of Lake Shore Drive. This modern stadium features an exploding scoreboard that sets off fireworks along with a Sony Jumbo Screen.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Further south, the charming Hyde Park neighborhood has retained its quaint, old-world charm. Home to the world-famous<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>University of Chicago, the area boasts interesting restaurants like Salonica and<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Medici, great used book stores like<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>O\''Gara & Wilson\''s<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>(the oldest used bookstore in the country), and the quaint<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>57th Street Art Fair. Hyde Park is also home to the gigantic 350,000 square-foot<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Museum of Science and Industry. This monument to 20th-century technology houses a replica coal mine, a German U-Boat and a Zephyr train and the Smart House: Green & Wired, a futuristic homemade with eco-friendly materials.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>After visiting the museum, enjoy a counterpoint to the world\''s industrial history with a leisurely stroll through<span class=\"apple-converted-space\"> </span>Jackson Park. Like its sister to the North, Lincoln Park, Jackson Park was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead. It features a Japanese garden, a bird sanctuary, a reflection pond and a golf course.Chicago is a destination that has so much to offer visitors.

It must have been a discouraging sight after such an arduous journey. Those early settlers would be amazed if they were to stand at the same vantage point today. The swamps have been drained and the water now runs to the sea through two orderly rivers, the Avon and the Heathcote, while houses have filled vast flat areas and are steadily climbing the hills.Nowadays few people arrive on sailing ships, most fly into Christchurch International Airport. On a fine day they enjoy a panoramic view of the city, lying on the edge of the Canterbury Plains; bound to the east by the Pacific coastline, to the south by the hills of Banks Peninsula, and to the west by the mountains of the Southern Alps. As the plane circles lower, newcomers can see the expansive Hagley Park, and the reason why Christchurch is lauded as the \''Garden City\'' is evident with a view of trees, parks and gardens, and some high-rises.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Start the exploration with the Canterbury Museum that chronicles the city\''s abundant natural wealth and historical heritage, and traces its journey from early days to a successful city. The Air Force Museum in Riccarton is yet another fascinating reveal, and features exhibits that include wartime artifacts, aircraft displays and other aviation-related memorabilia. The International Antarctic Centre is a definite must-visit, while the Quake City Museum offers a heart-wrenching accounts of the devastating February 2011 earthquake, its aftermath, and life of the locals in the wake of the traumatic event.

Christiania is an institution and a sanctuary as well, even if it seems to be the very contradiction of Tivoli. It is decidedly anti-establishment and was long considered rebel territory, having numerous clashes with the police. It is also walled in, surprisingly peaceful and with no apparent connection to the city (nor, indeed, to the country, EU or NATO, as is stated at the entrance). The area was squatted by hippies in the early 1970s and has remained untouched by the government ever since. Further out on Christianshavn is Holmen, another sanctuary, this one for film students, architects and like-minded people who work and study in the former naval base. A very unusual sanctuary, Assistens Kirkegård is a cemetery that hosts such local celebrities as Hans Christian Andersen and Søren Kierkegaard, as well as many others—and simultaneously serves as a public park offering picnic opportunities among the gravestones.Of the city\''s many parks, the most enchanting is Frederiksberg Have with Frederiksberg Palace, which offers the opportunity to rent little boats in the summer. Others are Kongens Have, where Inner City trendies meet for picnics, spontaneous games of football, or the Botanical Gardens with their overwhelming number of exotic flowers, trees and plants.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Patrons of modern art will find the two most important museums located outside of town in spectacular natural settings. To the north, in Humlebæk, Louisiana offers brilliant exhibitions as does its smaller southern counterpart, Arken in Ishøj. In the city itself, large exhibition spaces for contemporary art include Charlottenborg, the refurbished church Nikolaj, Kunstforeningen (Danish Society of Arts) and Den Frie (Independent Artists\'' Exhibitions). Also, The National Museum of Art has a strong permanent collection in its impressive new wing. For gallery-hopping in Copenhagen, the most rewarding area is traditionally Frederiksstaden, especially Bredgade and the area behind Hotel D\''Angleterre by Kongens Nytorv. Some of the more daring galleries such as Nikolai Wallner and Nils Stærk offer though-provoking exhibitions of contemporary art.The National Museum of Arts collection and enormous building are not just state-of-the-art, but also the state\''s museum of art. In English it is either called the National Museum of Art or the Danish National Gallery. While it has no real obligation to lead in the avant-garde, it has one of the world\''s best and most extensive collections of Scandinavian painters from all ages. For European masterpieces, New Carlsberg Glyptotek holds a varied and rich private collection that also includes an excellent Egyptian department. It also has had a recent extension built that is an architectural masterpiece—as have The National Museum of Art, the Royal Library on Slotsholmen, and Louisiana.Den Hirschprungske Samling, right across from The National Museum of Art in Østre Anlæg, is another beautiful private collection specializing in what is often referred to as the Golden Age of Danish painting including the famous Skagen—painters such as Krøyer and Hammershøj.Thorvaldsen\''s Museum is the country\''s first public art museum, a monument to sculptor Thorvaldsen. It opened in 1848 and is still an impressive sanctuary.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The entire Inner City of Copenhagen is in itself of historical interest, as it seems to have remained relatively untouched by the last couple of centuries. The history of the city can further be studied at the picturesque Copenhagen City Museum on Vesterbrogade. The history of the nation is told at The National Museum, Denmark\''s main museum of cultural history with unrivaled exhibitions of ancient art and handcrafts covering all of the nation\''s history and geography, including Greenland, the Faroe Islands and most of Scandinavia. Anyone with interest in Norse mythology, Vikings and early Nordic history should also visit the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, the working village of Lejre, and the Brede Works museum - each within an hour of the city. Back in Copenhagen, the Royal Danish Chronological Collection at Rosenborg Castle and Amalienborg show the history of the world\''s oldest royal family through their sometimes very amusing belongings and extravagant furniture. To contrast with this, the Workers\'' Museum has, as a permanent display, a depiction of working-class life in the 1930s and 1950s. The Carlsberg Museum has everything you need to know and taste about brewing beer. The Resistance Museum sheds light on the underground liberation movement during the German occupation in WWII. The Geological Museum captures other underground movements. Important castles outside the city include Frederiksborg Castle in Hillerød and Kronborg in Elsinore as the largest and most impressive. The amazing twin-towered church of Roskilde, Denmark\''s capital before the founding of Copenhagen, is among the finest and oldest in the world and duly listed under UNESCO\''s World Heritage Program.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Royal Theatre is home to one of the world\''s leading ballet companies, the Royal Danish Ballet, with regular shows on the Old Stage. The national Opera and Theatre companies also call the Royal Theatre their home while also performing elsewhere in the city. The New Theatre, Nørrebro Theatre, and Østre Gasværk often show big-budget musicals. A majority of popular theaters are located on Frederiksberg Allee.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Performances of classical music of the highest quality can be attended at Danish National Radio Concert Hall, Tivoli Concert Hall, and the Royal Theatre Helligåndskirken, Holmens Kirke, and Trinitatis Kirke. Many other city churches regularly also have organ concerts on weekdays. The best jazz venue in Copenhagen is Copenhagen Jazzhouse. Most important venues for contemporary rock and electronic music are Pumpehuset, Vega, Rust, Loppen, and Amager Bio.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Copenhagen is a city of movie-lovers, and for the connoisseur, Cinemateket in Filmhuset, Gloria, Posthusteatret, Grand, Husets Biograf and Vester Vov Vov all offer rare and high-quality screenings. Mainstream cinemas have for a long time been centered around the Town Hall Square and Vesterport Station, with the giant complexes Dagmar, Palads and Imperial showing Hollywood productions and the like. However, competition has come from the German CinemaxX Fisketorvet chain at the Fisketorvet Shopping Center, with its opening of 10 THX theaters and Northern Europe\''s largest silver screen. The Tycho Brahe Planetariet shows you breathtaking images of space as well as IMAX-screenings and a 3D IMAX movie. Østerbro\''s Park shows belated premieres and classics at discount prices.

 (612,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Indre By</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">All Denmark\''s roads, trains, and bicycle paths lead to the heart of the capital. Indre By (The Inner City) is the unrivaled commercial and cultural center of the entire city. Always buzzing with activity and crammed with people, this district is only completely empty on Sundays, as very few people actually live here. The Inner City is a picturesque area with many buildings dating back to the early 18th Century. The street plan dates back to the Middle Ages, which may explain the many seemingly irrational twists and turns that are characteristic of the area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pisserenden & Nørrevold</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cornered by Vor Frue Plads and Rådhuspladsen, Pisserenden is a lovely district.  Stretching along Søerne, on the city side, Nørrevold looks like the outer boroughs but is a city in itself. Stroll down Nansensgade, an intellectual hang-out, for great alternative shopping opportunities in an intimate setting. Don\''t miss the unique decor at Bankeråt. H.C. Ørstedsparken is a great place to take a stroll during the day.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Slotsholmen</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The monstrous Christiansborg, the seat of the Danish Parliament, resides on Slotsholmen, the very core of the Danish state. The semi-artificial island holds the Parliament as well as the offices of everything from the Supreme Court to the royal horses, the offices of the Prime Minister, the Danish Stock Exchange, the Thorvaldsens Museum, the Royal Court Theatre with the adjoining Theatre Museum, the Royal Brewery of Christian IV as well as the Royal Library, including its recent addition, Det Kongelige Bibliotek (Diamanten), arguably the most astonishing new piece of architecture north of Bilbao.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Christianshavn</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Looking like a supremely idyllic little piece of Amsterdam, Christianshavn is comprised of a cluster of artificial islands between Copenhagen and Amager. Guided canal tours via Kanalrundfarten will take you floating past the beautiful old houses, and you\''ll be able to see Copenhageners preparing their vessels for the sea or just taking it easy on the deck of a homemade house-boat. Christiania, a \"free town\" that was founded by squatters, is unlike anything you have ever seen, and further characterizes the area\''s unique atmosphere. The three northern islands of Christianshavn constitute Holmen, a former naval base. The area is now a unique colony for the arts.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Frederiksstaden</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the jolly beer-swingers in Nyhavn to the sanctuary of Kongens Have/Rosenborg Slotshave, Frederiksstaden is the royal district, laid out in a regular grid with the royal castle Amalienborg at the center and Marmorkirken towering above the lawyers, antique stores and galleries of Bredgade and Store Kongensgade. Designmuseum Danmark shows various exhibitions on modern design and design history, while Rosenborg Slot is a fancy country house now open to the public.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Østerbro</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The largest of the Copenhagen neighborhoods, Østerbro is bigger than most Danish cities and is full of famous attractions. The broad streets cut like canyons through endless uniform tenement buildings in red brick. Exceptions to this are Øster Farimagsgade, Nordre Frihavnsgade and Østerbrogade, all offering shops to the many inhabitants. On the western edge of Østerbro just north of Frederiksstaden, you\''ll find Kastellet, a historically significant defense fortification that is now open to the public. Langelinie pier, where you can personally greet none other than the Little Mermaid, is located north of the marina. Østerbro is also home to the national stadium, Parken, the largest park in the city, Fælledparken, as well as many embassies.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nørrebro</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nørrebro may not have the best reputation, but it remains one of the most colorful and ethnically diverse areas of Copenhagen (and very safe, generally speaking). A stroll up Nørrebrogade is a sightseeing tour in itself, and the Assistens Kirkegård, one of the city\''s oldest cemeteries, is the final resting place of people like Hans Christian Andersen and Søren Kierkegaard. The cemetery also functions as a park, with locals often seen having picnics among the gravestones. Sankt Hans Torv features popular cafes like Sebastopol, while clubs like Rust make for a bright night out.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Vesterbro</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This area is the old queen of the Copenhagen boroughs. Gentrification always had a hard time here, despite the city\''s ongoing attempts to clean up the area and polish the buildings. Istedgade still has plenty to offer, with big hotels and an ever-increasing number of students and artists. Vega is the center of its nightlife, and cafes Høeg\''s and Bang & Jensen are where all of Vesterbro meets.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Frederiksberg</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A city in its own right, Frederiksberg Slot is surrounded by Copenhagen on all sides, but still maintains its formal independence. While not exactly Broadway, this area boasts quite a number of small theaters. There is a certain Parisian quirkiness to Frederiksberg which many people find charming. It is mainly residential, belonging to a mostly conservative, well-to-do, over-40 crowd. There are plenty of good restaurants, wineries and tailors in the area. Deeper into the city, you\''ll find Frederiksberg Have, a beautiful park that contains Københavns Zoo.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Strandvejen</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Going all the way from Østerbro to Elsinore, Strandvejen spells money, tennis courts and long drinks by the marinas. An extraordinary cab ride will lead you past very beautiful and impressive estates and villas. Dyrehaven, with its tame deer, controlled wildlife and exclusive restaurants, is the favorite outing of all Copenhageners at any time of the year.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Catering for the needs of Cork\''s massive student population are pubs like An Brog and Hi-B, while Rearden\''s is a favorite hangout for sports fans and live music lovers. For the seasoned bar-goer, the legendary Sin é, a longstanding fixture in Shandon since 1889 needs no introduction. Alternatively, Fionbarra, the Abbot Ale House and The Bierhaus are exceptionally famous Irish pubs for their beer varieties, while the Crane Lane Theatre and the Welcome Inn might just be Cork\''s most definitive live music venues. The Half Moon Club, situated to the rear of Cork Opera House, is one of Cork\''s finest night spots. Featuring a wide variety of live acts from all over the globe, as well as home grown talent, this is a mecca for clubbers young and old, and comes highly recommended. If you crave a little laughter in your life, then City Limits Comedy Club is the place to go. It features some of the most successful comedians on tour. Others like the Mutton Lane Inn, Dan Lowrey\''s Tavern and the Franciscan Well Brewery are other heritage pubs that constitute Cork\''s pub-loving paradise.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If movies are your thing, you might like to check out Cork\''s modern multiplex cinema, The Gate, which is located on North Main Street. Equipped with the latest cutting-edge technology and exceptionally comfortable seating, The Gate has already proved hugely popular with the local denizens. For the film buff, there is The Triskel Arts Centre, which (among other things) features a wide selection of international films. The Movie Junction Drive-In cinema in Carrigtwohill also offers a different experience to movie-goers.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cork has a fine repertoire of local history museums that provide insight into the heritage and unique culture of this captivating city. The Cork Butter Museum, housed in the former butter market, chronicles the past of butter manufacturing in the city, while the Cork Gaol Museum recounts the history of this 19th Century prison. In Fitzgerald Park, the Cork Public Museum is worth a visit for anyone who would like to acquaint themselves about the city\''s early history and heritage.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cork is home to an ever expanding art scene. For both contemporary and historical art exhibitions, Crawford Art Gallery is well worth a visit: its permanent collection includes work by Jack B. Yeats and Louis Le Brocquy. Also on display are pieces from Cork\''s finest upcoming talent as well as regular touring exhibitions by international artists. A more comprehensive range of art forms are featured at The Triskel Arts Centre. The program includes drama, film, visual art, and literature. The Tig Fili Gallery, on MacCurtain Street, is an excellent venue for independent artists, exhibitions here rarely fail to thrill and provoke. Poetry readings and workshops also feature regularly. The Vanguard Gallery holds 13 shows a year featuring established artists and also an \''emerging artist show\'' once a year. The Lavitt Gallery on the quays is also a well established venue exhibiting modern art by local and international artists. The Lewis Glucksman Gallery, an award-winning gallery housed within the University College hosts brilliant art exhibitions in its extraordinary concrete-and-glass structure.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cork has an exciting and growing drama scene. From traditional Irish plays to experimental drama one can usually find something to suit their theatrical tastes. The Cork Opera House is the largest venue with a capacity of around 1,000. The program can feature anything from the Netherlands Dance Theatre to Sean O\''Casey. At the Everyman, one can also enjoy the best in mainstream drama, notable recent visitors have included the carnivalesque Macnas. The intimate Cork Arts Theatre is also worth a visit as is The Granary. If you are interested in modern dance, head down to the Firkin Crane, Ireland\''s premier dance venue situated in the heart of historic Shandon.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (622,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">City Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">St Patrick\''s Street runs through the heart of the city. It offers a host of shopping opportunities and boasts some of Europe\''s largest retail chains. Oliver Plunkett Street, which runs partly parallel to Patrick\''s Street, bustles with smaller shops, life and color. Shops selling second-hand books, hand-made chocolates, an infinite array of surprises can be found in the alleyways and lanes around this central shopping district. Heading west, one comes to the English Market, the culinary heart of Cork, boasting a huge array of fresh local produce, and tantalizing international delicacies. Following St Patrick\''s Street eastwards leads to the statue of Father Mathew, much respected founding father of the Irish Temperance Movement. Tucked off to the left, one finds the Cork Opera House, venue for national and international theater, opera, and concerts. The Crawford Art Gallery with its impressive collection to suit modern and traditional tastes is also to be found here. At the other end of St. Patrick\''s Street lies another one of the city\''s arterial streetways, Grand Parade. A visitor might wish to turn left here, past the cheerful greenery of Bishop Lucey Park, and view the impressive Nationalist Monument, or turn right to ramble along the Coal Quay, with its bustling Saturday open-air market. One block further west lies North Main Street, and the Cork Vision Centre. Situated in the historic St Peter\''s Church, it offers the visitor the opportunity to really get a feel for the city with a magnificent 1:500 scale model of the whole city.Further south is the Triskel Arts Centre, a vibrant cluster of gallery, theater, and drinking spaces. Venturing west, one leaves the inner center of the city, past corner-shops, and pubs, and toward the Mardyke Walk. This delightful stretch, which has been an institution amongst locals for over a century, leads directly to Fitzgerald Park. The Cork Public Museum is situated within the park and offers a wealth of information for those interested in local and national history. Defined by the two channels of the Lee, the city center of Cork has a beauty of its own, easily and best experienced on foot. A stroll along any of the waterways can be surprising and rewarding, while the island itself invites the visitor to lose their way, yet easily to find it again.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North of the City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The \"North Side\" is defined by hills rising up from the river, and toward the city\''s more hidden charms. Dominating the landscape is St Anne\''s Church, the lime and sandstone (two walls built of each) clock tower can be seen from all over the city. One can climb the tower to ring the famous Shandon Bells, and savor the spectacular view from the top. Directly below \"the bells\" is the old Cork Butter Exchange, now home to the intriguing Cork Butter Museum, and the Shandon Craft Centre. Perched on a more western point of the hill, lies the Cork City Gaol; this gloomy nineteenth-century prison welcomes the modern visitor with interesting exhibits and audio-visual displays. On the eastern end, St Patrick\''s Bridge links the city center with the charming MacCurtain Street, a busy stretch of road offering everything from antiques to ice cream. Worth noting on this street is the majestic Everyman Palace, venue for local and touring theater productions, and the historic Metropole Hotel, head-quarters for the annual Cork Jazz Festival.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South of the City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Gothic grandeur of St Finbarr\''s Cathedral dominates the horizon of Cork\''s \"South Side\". This 19th-century Anglican cathedral is as impressive on the inside as its gargoyle clustered exterior. Legend has it that the golden angel, perched on the cathedral\''s eastern extreme, will blow her horn to announce the ending of the world. In 1999, her two horns were stolen during construction work; they were returned some days later, to the great relief of locals. Nearby, one finds the ruins of the seventeenth-century Elizabeth Fort, a somber reminder of the Cromwell\''s era, and the rambling character of Barrack Street, as featured in the film <em>Angela\''s Ashes</em>. The street also offers a number drinking and live-music venues, popular with students of the nearby University College Cork (UCC). The stately college quadrangle is itself worth a visit, while the fascinating collection of Ogham stones (on public display), and the stained-glass windows of the Honan Chapel, make a visit to the campus an enlightening experience. The eastern end of the South Side is dominated by the City Hall, from the steps of which President John F Kennedy gave a public address in 1963. To the other side of the City Hall is the bustling docks area, while further out of town parks and walkways follow the river as far as the quaint and curious Blackrock Castle. Currachs (Irish traditional rowing boats), schoolboy eights, and mammoth container ships share this stretch of the Lee, reflecting the tradition and the industry that so define the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beyond the City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cork also makes an ideal base from which to explore the surrounding area. Buses leave frequently to the famous Blarney Castle. Traditionally, a kissing of the Blarney Stone invests the visitor with the \"gift of the gab\", though the more reticent guest might prefer a silent stroll in the beautiful surrounding gardens. Cobh (pronounced Cove), is connected by an hourly train to Cork. The Cobh Heritage Centre documents the town\''s place in history as the departure point for generations of emigrant, commercial and leisure vessels, as well as the last port visited by the ill-fated Titanic. Picturesque, and boasting some of Ireland\''s finest restaurants, Kinsale is only a short bus-ride from Cork, as is the Jameson Heritage Centre Whiskey Distillery in Midleton. Further afield, the beauties of West County Cork lay just waiting to be discovered.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

There is no nightlife on the east coast since the few restaurants there close at dusk. Downtown bars open until the wee hours include the Hard Rock Cafe with its great music and bar along with Carlos \''n Charlie\''s and Fat Tuesdays. Both open-air bars are known for their loud, party atmosphere. Smoke Cuban cigars while listening to hot jazz at The Havana Club. Enjoy the Sunday Fiesta at Plaza Central, a live open-air concert with Mexican or Caribbean song and dance. If sipping margarita\''s on an oceanfront deck is your idea of a good time, then Margaritaville Cozumel is the place for you. Longstanding favorite, Coconuts Bar and Grill offers spectacular views along with tropical drinks from its cliff-top perch. The Casa de la Cultura offers local programs of music, dance, theatre and art. If you are lucky enough to be on the island during Carnaval(mid-February to March), you are in for an explosion of music, dance, parades and parties that fill the streets.  The largest movie theatre on the island is now the Cinepolis Complex, just minutes away from downtown San Miguel. It shows the latest Hollywood blockbusters with Spanish subtitles. Besides this location, Cinepolis also has other cinemas on the island, all with great facilities and a line-up of blockbuster films.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals and Celebrations</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Annual festivals celebrate Mexican traditions in this sunny isle. Held every February, the Cozumel Carnival, their version of Mardis Gras is brings the island to its feet. Other festivals celebrating Mexican heritage and culture include the Festival of El Cedral, Cinco de Mayo, Feast of San Miguel and El Día de los Muertos or Day of the Dead.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shoppers can get easily get their fix at a variety of stores selling Mexican handicraft art, souvenirs, clothing, diamonds and gold or silver jewelry. There are plenty of bargains to be found at the open-air markets just off the square. <font color=\"#000000\">Los Cinco Soles</font> is a popular souvenir stop, especially with the cruise ship crowd. Cozumel is famous for its jewelry stores. Among the most visited are <font color=\"#000000\">Diamonds International</font> which offers choices in diamonds, gold and silver jewelry. Because Cozumel is a duty-free shopping zone there are some great bargains to be found on luxury items. Head to Pama Cozumel in San Miguel for your duty-free shopping afternoon.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Fun</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With 285 days of sunshine a year, Cozumel offers endless hours of fun in the sun. There is something for everyone to enjoy on the island.  The Atlantis Submarines adventure is an amazing exploration of the reef, but is very expensive. Rancho Buenavista and Mr Sanchos Beach Club Cozumel offer horseback riding through the jungle. Tours that explore the island\''s northern end on ATVs (all-terrain vehicles) can be arranged with Wild Tours or Dune Buggy Tours.  Deep-sea fishing is also a popular activity. Scuba divers will find plenty of underwater sites to explore. The most popular reefs are on the southwestern side of the island. Paradise Reef, Chan Kanaab Reef, Villa Blanca Wall, Santa Rosa Wall, Palancar Reef and Plane Wreck are just a sampling of what you can expect to find beneath the turquoise waters. There is no shortage of scuba diving companies and tours. There are also none that could be considered inexpensive. Aqua Safari, Caballito del Caribe and Eagle Ray Dive School are some of the more experienced companies on the island.  On the mainland, popular tourist attractions include the famous Mayan ruins of Tulum and Chichen Itza, the natural aquarium Xel-Ha and the 250 acre, eco-archaeological park Xcaret.  Two inexpensive attractions are the San Gervasio ruins and Parque Punta Sur. You will find the most expensive part is the transportation out there. Chankanaab Park is an excellent bargain since your entry fee includes an archaeological park, botanical garden, a museum, a free dolphin show and great snorkeling. A fun family evening can be had at Discover Mexico Cozumel Park, a cultural theme park offering a variety of interactive experiences. For a more educational family experience visit Museo de la Isla de Cozumel, which has historical and natural exhibits about the island. For those on a budget, there is still plenty to do in Cozumel, provided you bring your own snorkel gear. You don\''t have to pay any entry fee to get onto the beaches since all beachfront is Federal Property with free access to everyone. Plaza las Glorias allows visitors to snorkel as long as they buy something at the bar. Corona Beach has few crowds but good snorkeling. For lots of action you can visit San Francisco Beach or Playa del Sol. You won\''t find as many swimmers along the eastern beaches due to much heavier surf and a strong undertow. Surfers like to gather at Punta Morena, where the waves are high and burgers are cheap. (Families should take their children to the west coast beaches where the surf is much calmer.) You can also hike along the northern road that starts where the Costera Este Highway ends. The beaches there are wild and beautiful and camping is permitted.  Windsurfing, kayaks and jet skis are available on most of the beaches. However, renting them turns free fun into expensive fun.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Meadows Museum, located on the campus of Southern Methodist University, has one of the world\''s finest collections of Spanish art outside of Madrid. The Perot Museum of Nature and Science, a premier repository of scientific artifacts and exhibits is so huge that it consists of two campuses located in Victory Park and Fair Park.

Also of great interest is the Dallas Holocaust Museum/Center for Education & Tolerance, a landmark on Record Street that offers a deeply sobering experience with its moving artifacts and exhibits, wall-to-wall plaques inscribed with relatives of Dallas\'' residents lost to the Holocaust, and a memorial room.

The Detroit River is a resource that the city has never fully exploited, although a system of parks and greenways is now gradually taking shape.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The magnificent, restored Fox Theatre is at the center of the action, and it\''s worth visiting just to see the building, no matter what\''s on stage. The smaller, exquisitely decorated Gem Theatre is also a must-see. The nearby Fillmore Detroit is operating again after years of being shut down. The Cass Corridor and Wayne State University have spawned a vital and varied nightlife scene, so choices are plentiful. Wayne State\''s Hilberry and Bonstelle theaters are first-class venues with uniformly good productions of student-staffed plays. The Detroit Film Theatre attracts big crowds every weekend for non-mainstream movies in its auditorium at the rear of the Detroit Institute of Arts. In the New Center Area, the sedate, elegant Fisher Theatre hosts touring Broadway shows. It is worth the trip just to see the building\''s spectacular golden lobby and the ornate theater. Other venerable venues are the Virgil H Carr Cultural Arts Center.Nearby, the Detroit Opera House boasts a huge orchestra pit and excellent acoustics, while The Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts is one of the nation\''s premier venues for dance, drama and jazz. Parking can get tricky around Greektown, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. There are a good number of small venues for jazz, rock and other nightlife. The grungy St. Andrew\''s Hall features alternative rock, while other small clubs abound. For fans of jazz, Baker\''s Keyboard Lounge is a must-see for good eats and great live music.

 (669,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The old downtown of grand movie houses and department stores is all but vanished, but lively areas have sprung up around the perimeter of the aging banking-and-commerce center. The north end of downtown is the latest hot spot. Comerica Park, a new baseball stadium for the Detroit Tigers, opened in 2000. The National Football League Detroit Lions, who abandoned downtown in the 1970s for suburban Pontiac, have since returned to Ford Field, which was built adjacent to Comerica Park.

The Grosse Pointe area boasts mansions of auto executives and scenic Lakeshore Drive. The nondescript suburbs of Macomb County include some items of interest: The Macomb Center for the Performing Arts, the General Motors Tech Center in Warren, and Metropolitan Beach on Lake St. Clair.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Windsor</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the few places in the United States where one can travel south into Canada is from downtown Detroit. By way of the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel or by bridge, it\''s easy to reach Windsor, Ontario, whose clubs and restaurants are an integral part of the metro Detroit entertainment scene. The popular Windsor Casino served as the impetus for Detroit to start building its own.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The first stop on any literary related excursion to Dublin would have to be Trinity College. First established in 1592, the university is home to the famed medieval manuscript, the Book of Kells, and also has associations with Samuel Beckett, Bram Stoker, Edmund Burke and Oscar Wilde. The nearby Merrion Square is also steeped in literary heritage. The former home of both Oscar Wilde and W.B. Yeats, the square boasts an impressive central garden and a beautifully camp memorial to Wilde himself. The spectacular St. Patrick\''s Cathedral and adjacent Marsh\''s Library are associated with satirist Jonathan Swift, while devotees of the playwright George Bernard Shaw can visit his birthplace in a restored Victorian house at 33 Synge Street.Dublin\''s north-side is also rich in literary attractions. Still a focal point for much of Ireland\''s new dramatic writing, the Abbey Theatre was originally founded in 1904 by W.B. Yeats and played host to plays by Sean O\''casey and J.M. Synge\''s infamous <em>Playboy of the Western World</em>. More contemporary dramatists such as Brian Friel, Frank McGuinness and Marina Carr have all had premieres staged here, and the Abbey\''s sister theater, the Peacock, continues to promote new writing. Theater buffs may also be interested in the Gate Theatre, which was first founded by Hilton Edwards and Edward MacLiammoir in 1928.For those less familiar with Dublin\''s literary contributions, a visit to the Dublin Writers Museum may be in order. Located on Parnell Square, the museum\''s collection includes an impressive array of photographs, paintings, first editions and memorabilia, all of which offer an excellent introduction to Irish writing in general. The popular Chapter One restaurant is located in the basement of the museum. While there is a plethora of writers and dramatists associated with the city, Dublin was undoubtedly best captured by its supreme chronicler James Joyce. Despite popular conjecture, Joyce wasn\''t awarded a Nobel Prize, but his influence on both world literature and culture has been staggering. <em>Ulysses</em> still remains the novel by which most others are measured, and its labyrinthine structure name-checks countless city landmarks, the most immediately obvious of which is the Martello Tower in Sandymount. While the majority of Dubliners would probably admit to having not actually read the novel, the city celebrates its Joycean heritage on June 16th. Increasingly becoming a high-profile event, Bloomsday recreates the events that take place over the novel\''s 24-hour time span, and plays host to festivities all over the capital. The James Joyce Centre on the elegantly restored North Great Georges Street organizes the event, and remains a focal point of activity all year round.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Given the fact that Dublin is still a relatively small city, there is an impressively wide range of galleries and museums within walking distance of the city center. For those interested in the history of Ireland, a visit to the National Museum is certainly advised. Based on two sites, the Museum houses artifacts which date from 7000 BC to the present day. The original Kildare Street site was first opened in 1890, and features examples of Celtic and medieval art such as the famous Ardagh Chalice, Tara Brooch and the Derrynaflan Hoard. The museum also houses a fascinating exhibition dealing with the turbulent 1916-1921 period of Irish history, which led to independence. The impressive Collins Barracks site, meanwhile, is based in the oldest continuously occupied barracks in the world and is Ireland\''s museum of the decorative arts and of economic, social, political and military history. Those seeking a more contemporary image of Ireland should check out the Gallery of Photography in Temple Bar.The Chester Beatty Library , originally owned by the American engineer Sir Alfred Chester Beatty, houses a fine collection of Early Christian, Islamic and East Asian manuscripts, paintings, prints, icons and books. Those conducting genealogical information should pay a visit to the National Library, which offers research facilities that are second to none.The Natural History Museum on Merrion Square was first opened in 1857. Particularly popular with children, the gallery has a Victorian, almost Gothic feel to it, and appears to have remained wholly unchanged since the 19th century. In an age of computer-aided exhibits and technology, it provides a marvelous glimpse at the mausoleum-museums of days gone by; and poking through its range of grotesque stuffed animals, bottled insects and bizarre flora and fauna is a surprisingly fascinating way to spend an afternoon.While not having the fine art legacy of other European cities, there are also several excellent galleries in Dublin, where Ireland\''s relatively little known artists can be appreciated. The National Gallery is an essential stop-off in an exploration of the history of Irish art. A Jack B. Yeats room displays the paintings, notebooks and other artifacts from this important and compulsively creative Irish family. A five minute walk from the National Gallery is the RHA Gallery on Ely Place. The RHA displays exhibitions from the more successful of living Irish artists, as well as significant retrospectives and the annual National College of Art and Design degree showcase. The development of the Temple Bar Gallery and Studios has been a prime example of the maturing of the Irish arts scene. In the 1980s and \''90s, artists took over a dilapidated building in the then run-down Temple Bar area and set up studios and a gallery. With the design of the area as a cultural quarter, the gallery enjoyed a major refurbishment and is now one of the more important contemporary galleries in the city. The Taylor, Kavanagh, Kerlin galleries are all also worth a visit. Adjacent to the Garden of Remembrance, a stone\''s throw away from historic O\''connell Street, the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art is probably the most significant gallery on Dublin\''s northside. The Hugh Lane houses an impressive permanent collection and a series of ongoing contemporary art exhibitions. A short walk from the city center, the Irish Museum of Modern Art is well worth a visit. Located in the stylishly refurbished Kilmainham hospital, IMMA always has something interesting on show, with ongoing exhibitions of both Irish and international art. The museum has hosted successful retrospectives of Andy Warhol and Joseph Beuys, amongst others, and the permanent collection of modern art is also essential viewing. A children\''s response room and artists in residence add to the modern art experience in this fine 18th century building.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Live Music and Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Dublin\''s live music scene is as vibrant and as happening as ever. Sporting slickly designed interiors and accompanying nightclubs, music venues draw a variety of established Irish and international acts, the more popular of which generally play at larger capacity venues like the Olympia Theatre.For atmosphere, quality and character, however, Dublin\''s smaller pub venues are still where it\''s at. Whelan\''s on Wexford Street is probably one of the best music venues in the city: with great acoustics, a friendly and loyal crowd and a spectacular balcony view of its tiny but perfectly adequate stage. Whelan\''s is a great place to catch up-and coming Dublin bands and emerging international acts, usually of a rock, folk or alternative variety, and the cover charge is always reasonable.If traditional Irish music is your thing, you\''re not exactly spoilt for choice. Some of Dublin\''s more authentic pubs like the Cobblestone, the Harcourt Hotel, O\''shea\''s and O\''donoghues feature trad sessions, but the quality varies considerably from night to night.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sport is hugely popular in Ireland and for many it is more than a matter of national pride, but a way of life. The Gaelic Athletic Association, which was first founded in 1884, drew up rules and regulations for native, indigenous sports, and was just as much a political movement as a recreational one. Golf is also extremely popular in Ireland and Dublin boasts approximately 55 different links, most of which are located in suburban areas, including the internationally renowned Portmarnock Golf Course, which has hosted many major championships including the Irish Open. Many of these clubs are privately owned, however, and require membership of a golf union. A number of smaller clubs such as Hollystown, Elm Green and the Swords Open Golf Club, operate a green fees policy and are within easy reach of the city center. More information, including a list of private courses, can be obtained from the Golfing Union of Ireland. The Murphy\''s Irish Open is one of the highlights of the professional golf calendar and is held every July. Other marvelous courses are located within an hour\''s drive of the city.Ireland also boasts some of the finest fishing locations in the world, although Dublin is not exactly spoilt for choice. Coarse fishing options can be found along the river Liffey, the Royal Canal, the Dodder and the Grand Canal, while Dublin\''s coastline offers excellent sea fishing opportunities. Dun Laoghaire, Howth, Skerries, Dalkey and Killiney beach are all good locations. Permits can be obtained from most fishing tackle shops. A state license is required for river fishing for salmon or sea trout from the Fishery Board. Sea, rock, beach or canal fishing does not require a permit, however.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Family-friendly Entertainment</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although not always apparent from first glance, Dublin offers a wealth of attractions for both the young and young at heart. The Dublin Zoo is a popular haunt, making for an enjoyable and often educational afternoon. The Ark in Temple Bar is Ireland\''s only cultural center for children, regularly hosting exhibitions, theater performances and workshops. Cinemas, of course, remain always reliable, particularly on rainy days, and with several well-situated theaters like the Savoy and the Cineworld Dublin on offer, you should be spoilt for choice.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

In the 1980s, the district was scheduled to be demolished to make way for a vast bus station, but was saved by some last-minute planning decisions and became instead the focus of Dublin\''s urban regeneration scheme throughout the 1990s. Every turn uncovers more distinctive shops and another trendy arts center. With music and television recording studios, the excellent Irish Film Institute and other media magnets, this is where Dublin\''s cultural heart is to be found. By night, visitors (and some Dubliners) gravitate towards Temple Bar and its environs to socialize. Here, above a former Viking settlement, they come to soak up the cafe culture or have a drink in one of the ever-growing number of bars and pubs. The Porterhouse Temple Bar, the 160-year old Temple Bar Pub, and the Auld Dubliner, among several others, constitute the area\''s heritage pub sphere. A number of social and local events take place around two of its main squares - the Meetinghouse Square and the Temple Bar Square. Of these, the Temple Bar Book Market and the Cow\''s Lane Market, a trendy market for fashion and design merchandise, are equally famous.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Medieval Dublin</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The area around Temple Bar flows seamlessly into the historic heart of the city. Dublin Castle is the former seat of British power and home to the Viceroys of Ireland. With its ornate dining hall, crystal chandeliers and prestigious state rooms, the Castle still constitutes a powerful symbol of the British colonial presence—even though today the Castle witnesses the inaugurations of the Presidents of Ireland. Also contained in the large Castle complex is the marvelous Chester Beatty Library, one of the world\''s great treasure houses of Islamic and Oriental art. On the edge of the Castle lies the refurbished City Hall. The great domed atrium of the building—originally founded in the 18th century to house the Royal Exchange—is one the city\''s most beautiful and impressive spaces. Dublin Castle and the twin medieval cathedrals of St Patrick and Christchurch, are some of the oldest and most significant buildings in Dublin. Tucked behind St Patrick\''s is the exquisite Marsh\''s Library, set amid formal gardens and housed in a beautiful Queen Anne mansion. The interior is no less marvelous: the library still features a cage in which scholars were locked whilst consulting the Library\''s most treasured possessions. Marsh\''s is one of Dublin\''s hidden jewels and holds a wide array of manuscripts and first editions, as well as a considerable collection of Turkish, Hebrew and Arabic printings. Trinity College, a famous seat of learning and one of the great universities of Europe is also located here. The long list of famous alumni includes Samuel Beckett, Edmund Burke and Oscar Wilde. The College unfolds from Front Gate in a series of elegant quadrangles, which in turn give way to College Park, home to cricket matches on languorous summer afternoons. You should make a point of visiting the Berkeley Library in Fellows Square, which is the best example of modernist architecture in the city and the College Chapel in Front Square. Trinity\''s greatest treasure, however, is the beautiful illuminated medieval manuscript called the Book of Kells, housed in the great vaulted Long Room—perhaps the finest interior in Dublin.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Georgian Dublin</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The elegant charm of southeast Dublin stands as a testament to Georgian urban design. Amongst the throngs of tourists is the exquisite Merrion Square complete with beautiful central gardens and a wonderful memorial to Oscar Wilde, who lived in the square in his youth. Other alumni of the Square include W.B. Yeats, Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu and the great Liberator himself, Daniel O\''connell. More recently, the British Embassy occupied the east side of Merrion Square until it was burned to the ground in 1972 in the aftermath of the Bloody Sunday killings in Derry. Nearby, Fitzwilliam Square is much smaller and more intimate and is the best preserved of Dublin\''s great set-piece Georgian squares. A few minutes walk west brings one to the lovely open space that is St Stephen\''s Green, which undoubtedly forms the centerpiece of 18th-century Dublin\''s impressive town planning. Many notable buildings surround the Green, including the Royal College of Surgeons, still pockmarked with bullets from the 1916 Easter Rising, and the Shelbourne, Dublin\''s original posh hotel and still the best spot for afternoon tea in the city. Newman House, two Georgian townhouses on the south side of the Green which were the original home of University College Dublin, have been superbly restored, and today their fantastic internal decorations can be seen in all their splendor. The central gardens of the Green feature a lake and many statues, including tributes to Yeats and Countess Marcievicz. The statue of Wolfe Tone in the southwest corner of the Green was blown up by loyalist terrorists in 1979. Once his head was (luckily) discovered by the Shelbourne Hotel, the statue was reconstructed. Grafton Street runs into the northeastern corner of the Green and is a shopper\''s paradise, but in your purchasing frenzy don\''t forget the National Gallery, National Museum or Leinster House, home of the Irish parliament (Dail Eireann), which are all of enormous cultural interest.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Liberties</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Inherited its name from its days as a toll-free district. Brick Lane and Francis Street boast a glittering array of antique shops and the colorful Mother Redcap\''s Market. The famous Dublinia, the historic Guinness Storehouse, and the Tivoli Theatre are all located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kilmainham</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The greatest attraction of this western district is undoubtedly Kilmainham Gaol. The leaders of the 1916 Rising were executed here, radicalizing the Irish public and marking the beginning of the end of the British administration in Dublin. The old jail was built according to the Enlightenment principles of panopticism or continual surveillance. It has found stardom in its own right, featuring in such films as <em>In the Name of the Father</em>, and includes an excellent museum documenting colonial history and political martyrdom in Ireland. Also in the Kilmainham area is the Irish Museum of Modern Art which opened in 1991. It has become a key Irish cultural institution. IMMA is housed in the former Royal Hospital, constructed in 1684 as a home for retired soldiers; and well worth seeing in its own right. The museum also features the beautifully restored chapel and a fine baroque formal garden. Nearby also lies the Guinness Storehouse which pays homage to one of Ireland\''s biggest—and most enjoyed—exports.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North of the River</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The northern districts of Dublin never really recovered after being abandoned by the professional middle classes, who migrated south of the river or left for London after the Act of Union in 1801. Once home to Europe\''s worst city slum, times are changing, but gentrification is still a relatively slow process in comparison to the rate of development in areas south of the Liffey.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">O\''connell Street</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The main artery of Dublin\''s city center has been sadly neglected in recent years, but now seems due for revival. The grand, broad and tree-lined boulevard has suffered from intrusions of fast-food outlets, but ambitious plans are now afoot to return to its former reputation as Main Street, Ireland. This should not, perhaps, prove too difficult: all of O\''connell Street\''s main institutions remain in place: the Gresham Hotel, Eason bookshop and the Gate Theatre. O\''connell Street is also home to Dublin\''s most potent symbol—the General Post Office (GPO). In 1916, the GPO served as headquarters of the Easter Rising, and the proclamation of the Irish Republic was read from its steps. The building still bears the scars of the violence of those few days and retains its radical credentials to this day, remaining the favorite choice of location for any demonstration. Georgian Parnell Square, the Dublin Writers Museum and the fine Hugh Lane Municipal Museum of Art are the other major points of interest in this area. Close at hand, the elegant James Joyce Centre is housed in a fine Georgian townhouse. North of O\''connell Street, in the Drumcondra area of the city, lie the Botanic Gardens, complete with impressive glasshouses and a riverside walk. Glasnevin Cemetery lies nearby and while a stroll through a graveyard might not seem like most people\''s idea of a jolly afternoon out, this particular cemetery lies close to the heart of Ireland\''s national psyche and houses the remains of a multitude of historical and cultural figures: de Valera, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Daniel O\''connell and Michael Collins are just some of the names on the cemetery\''s gravestones.East of O\''connell Street lies Custom House Quay, set on fire by Sinn Fein supporters in the turmoil of 1921. Custom House is the 18th-century masterpiece of architect James Gandon and was long considered a powerful symbol of British colonialism. The restoration of the impressive, colonnade-lined structure we now see on the waterfront was finally completed in 1991. While the building now houses government offices, sections of the elegant interior are open to the public. While the Custom House is particularly imposing when illuminated at night, by day it is worth studying for the great statue of Commerce which adorns the tip of the copper dome, and for the representations of the gods of Ireland\''s 14 great rivers. Beyond the Custom House, the quays stretch for miles to the Pigeonhouse Fort, now an electricity generating station with candy-striped towers which have become something of a city landmark. The thin and low South Wall breakwater stretches a mile into Dublin Bay, culminating in the Poolbeg Lighthouse: it is probably the best place in Dublin for a bracing, seaside walk.West of O\''connell Street, the city quays continue to the Four Courts, seat of the Irish justice system. Also designed by James Gandon, it survived damage in both the 1916 Rising before being extensively damaged in the Civil War of 1922. The building houses the High Court and Supreme Court of Ireland and, unfortunately, only the central atrium is open to the public. Behind the Four Courts lies Smithfield Village, once a working-class area of small cottages and a weekly horse market, and now the site of Dublin\''s most ambitious urban regeneration scheme to date. Many small cafes and restaurants have sprung up here in recent years. The centerpiece of the area, however, is the impressive National Museum at Collins Barracks, opened in 1997 and—in contrast to the original site at Kildare Street—emphasizing Ireland\''s recent history. There is also a strong focus on fashion and decorative art.Phoenix Park is the lungs of the city. Covering 1752 acres, this is the largest city park in Europe and is the location of the Dublin Zoo and Aras an Uachtarain, the official residence of the President of Ireland. The Visitor Centre will help you get your bearings. Also worth visiting is the Papal Cross, raised as a memorial to the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1979. Over a million people gathered in the park to hear the Pope utter his immortal line, \"Young people of Ireland, I love you.\"</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Coast</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Dublin\''s proximity to the sea has always been one of its greatest assets, and there is much to see along the shoreline of Dublin Bay. The DART public metro, which hugs the coastline for miles, is a good way of orienting yourself. Coastal villages such as Dalkey, Killiney & Greystones all lie along the DART line and are worth visiting in their own right. North of the Liffey estuary, Bull Island is a breezy bird sanctuary and home of one of the city\''s most exclusive golf courses, the Royal Dublin. North even more, the peninsula of Howth forms the northern arm of Dublin Bay and is a fine destination for a day out. Howth village is built around its pretty harbor, and apart from fine restaurants and fish and chip shops, is also the start of magnificent cliff walks to Howth Head and the Bailey Lighthouse. Howth Head and Howth summit afford sweeping views of Dublin and its bay.South of the Liffey, prosperous suburbs follow the railway to Dun Laoghaire and beyond. The wide sands at Sandymount stretch for miles and the great harbor walls at Dun Laoghaire, one of engineering miracles of the 19th century, are a favorite walk for many Dubliners (20 minutes out and 20 minutes back). A little further out, the pretty village of Dalkey is a classified heritage area and haunt of the rich and famous (U2, Enya, Lisa Stansfield and more hang out in the area) and the sweep of Killiney Bay is compared (frequently and tediously, but truly) with the Bay of Naples.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

This summer extravaganza centers on two festivals that run concurrently — The Edinburgh International Festival and The Fringe Festival, both of which focus on the performing arts. The former invites touring professionals from all over the world, whilst the latter welcomes new talent and crowds of students and wannabees. Up-and-coming comics frequent The Pleasance, whose outdoor bar is open late into the night, and the Gilded Balloon. The comedy is one of the best things at the Festival and a must on the stand-up circuit — you are very likely to see acts that will later appear on TV. Amateur theatrical and dance productions are often of a very high standard, although one of the joys of the Fringe is being the only member of the audience at an obscure, incomprehensible play.  Edinburgh goes crazy during the Festival; it\''s packed with street-performers, tourists, talent scouts and hangers-on. As there are so many productions on, you are never short of entertainment. If you are at all interested in the performing arts, the Edinburgh Festival should not be left off your summer schedule. The Edinburgh Military Tattoo also takes place in the summer — during the month of August. The Tattoo is one of the world\''s finest military displays, attended by over 200,000 people. It\''s a splendid mix of pomp, pageantry, music, ceremony, entertainment and drama — all set against the stunning backdrop of Edinburgh Castle. Hogmanay is a ticket-only (ish) affair for New Year celebrations. The festivities stretch over days and cover all forms of entertainment — a programme is available near the end of the year.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Art galleries are everywhere in Edinburgh. From architecture and design, to oils and watercolor, a plethora of disciplines can be found on show. For fine art, the National Portrait Gallery and the National Gallery of Scotland are the must-sees. But it is the contemporary art scene that is particularly exciting in the capital. Formerly thought of as Glasgow\''s exclusive terrain, Edinburgh now frequently displays fresh Scottish talent and cutting-edge art: the Fruitmarket Gallery is the best for this, whilst the nearby City Art Centre and Collective Gallery are also worth a look. Contemporary crafts can be found at the Scottish Gallery and Nexus Galleries.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is a popular diversion in Edinburgh. As capital city of the nation that produced Sean Connery, Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlyle, Edinburgh has a fittingly fine selection of cinemas. Lothian Road, behind the castle, offers both types of flicks — Filmhouse Cinema for art-house, and ODEON Cinemas for general release. Apart from these, there are also other multiplex cinemas around the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music, Dance and Opera</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Music, dance and opera are all on tap to entertain you in this city. You can listen to The Scottish Chamber Orchestra at Queen\''s Hall and indie at the Liquid Room. The best place to experience classical music, ballet or opera, however, has to be the Edinburgh Festival Theatre. There are many venues; from tiny darkened dive to classical theater - you\''ll find them all in Edinburgh.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums have a fine reputation here and they\''ve got much to be proud of. Educational excitement for kids and grown-ups can be found all over, but especially in the Old Town. The Museum of Scotland is a must-see, full of ancient and modern exhibits. A visit to the capital is clearly incomplete without a visit to Edinburgh Castle and the Holyroodhouse Palace — the fun and fascination doesn\''t stop there. The Royal Mile holds many treats, including Gladstone\''s Land and the John Knox House Museum and it would be a sin for any good whiskey-drinking soul to miss the Scotch Whisky Heritage Centre. To the south of the city center, the Royal City Observatory is a more space-age experience.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightclubs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightclubs are easy to find in Edinburgh. Clubbers will not be disappointed with the wide choice — indie fans, rock chicks, laid-back lounge lizards and hard-core house fanatics can all shake their stuff here. Cowgate is a popular clubber\''s haunt, with the ATIK and La Belle Angele offering something for everyone. Not far from here is the rockin\'' Lola Lo. Live music at the Liquid Room and gay cabaret at CC Blooms offer twists on the classic club-scene. For a chic VIP affair, few places beat the Opal Lounge while those with a love for jazz will appreciate the vibe and the great line up of jazz acts at the Jazz Bar.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater really comes alive during August and the Festival, but happily, the Edinburgh boards are also walked during the rest of the year. Behind Edinburgh Castle, the Royal Lyceum Theatre offers mainstream and avant-garde performances, whilst the Traverse Theatre is a real treat for contemporary writing. For a taste of London\''s famed West End, the Edinburgh Playhouse is a great choice that hosts musicals and big-name shows under its roof. The Royal National Theatre and other renowned touring companies often grace the stage at the historic King\''s Theatre with their presence. Considered one of Scotland\''s most prestigious theaters, The King\''s Theatre is a favorite for theater enthusiasts.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (708,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Old Town</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is the medieval heart of Edinburgh in which most of its important historical monuments can be found, including Edinburgh Castle, Holyroodhouse Palace (the Royal Scottish residence) and St Giles\'' Cathedral. The Royal Mile is the historical artery of the Old Town, linking together Edinburgh\''s two royal strongholds: Edinburgh Castle and the Holyroodhouse Palace. Running the length of four streets — Castlehill, Lawnmarket, High Street and Canongate — it\''s a vibrant, buzzing location. This is especially so during the Edinburgh Festival, when the Old Town is filled with street performers and people thrusting flyers into the hands of passers-by, all in the hope of drumming up larger audiences for their shows. It\''s also something of a tourist trap and, as a result, souvenir shops have sprung up in droves. However, the vitality and historical significance of this part of town make it an essential stop on any visitor\''s checklist. The Cowgate and Grassmarket areas are towards the southern end of the Old Town. This bustling area is filled with clubs, pubs, music venues and second-hand clothes shops. It\''s a pretty cool place in which to be seen and for the locals it\''s their first port of call on a night out. When the sun shines the Grassmarket has the feel of a continental town; relaxed <em>al fresco</em> coffee drinking, little traffic and authentic, colorful shop-fronts make this one of Europe\''s premier haunts.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Princes Street Gardens</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">These gardens fill the valley between Old Town and New Town, with Princes Street itself lining the northern side. During the Christmas and New Year period there is an ice-rink set up here under the gaze of a crystallized Edinburgh Castle. There is a decidedly festive atmosphere in the park at this time with stalls selling Christmas trees and seasonal ornaments. During the summer months the park acts as a Mecca for visitors in search of panoramic views of the city; for tourists who wish to climb the Scott Monument; for workers lunching in the open; for children who want to play a round of mini-golf; and for just about anybody who needs to relax. In Princes Street Gardens you never escape the atmospheric sound of the bagpipes, though you can escape the hustle and bustle of Princes Street itself. The Mound is bang in the middle of Princes Street Gardens. It is called The Mound because it is, quite literally, the mound of earth that was left over from dredging the Loch at the foot of the castle. It\''s the site of the Royal Scottish Academy and the National Gallery of Scotland. In the summer it attracts many festival performers and craft stalls.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The New Town</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whilst the Old Town marks the historical part of the city, the New Town is more a celebration of business, order and classical Georgian architecture. This is the terrain of the shops, offices and banks, which are laid out in gridded streets that emanate precision and symmetry. George Street is the centerpiece of the New Town. It is an up-and-coming area and now boasts high-quality shops and restaurants including Browns, Space NK Apothecary, Jones and many others. Flanked by Queen Street and Princes Street, which run in parallel, Geroge Street is a wide and elegant thoroughfare with impressive squares at both ends. At the western end lies Charlotte Square, designed by Robert Adam in 1791 and home of St George\''s church (now West Register House). The other end finds St Andrew Square — home of the Melville Monument and the historic mansion, Dundas House. It also marks the financial area of the New Town.  Princes Street, just below George Street, is the main shopping area of Edinburgh and the most famous part of the New Town. A very busy spot, its views of the Edinburgh Castle and proximity to Princes Street Gardens happily make up for the crowds of shoppers. The most impressive building is General Register House, at the northeastern end of the street. Also at this end is Waverley market, just next to the station. This shopping centre is a popular venue for performers during the Festival. Whilst Princes Street offers shoppers department stores and high street chains, Rose Street, just behind it, is an attractive pedestrian area with small shops and cafes. Stockbridge & Dean are in the western part of the New Town, and are known for being bohemian and less structured. Funky, trendy little shops and boutiques sit alongside various eating-places and bars. Places like Randolph Crescent and Moray Place give the area a more curvaceous look with classical Georgian fronts. Dean Village is an attractive old milling community, whilst Stockbridge is a great place to browse through antique and ethnic shops.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Calton</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the east of the city, this hill is a popular spot for watching the Festival fireworks. The views of Edinburgh Castle and Arthur\''s Seat are wonderful and if you like, you can climb the Nelson Monument to increase the panorama. The Royal City Observatory and Old Royal High School are situated in this area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Holyrood Park and Arthur\''s Seat</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This area is just behind the Holyroodhouse Palace. Known as Arthur\''s Seat (from the gaelic \"ard-Na-Said\" - meaning \"height of arms\"), this extinct volcano - it hasn\''t erupted in 350 million years - towers over of Holyrood Park. Originally a hunting ground, the public can now stroll through the park\''s 263 hectares (650 acres) and walk over lava flows to get a great view of the city. There are also many swans and ducks to feed in St. Mary\''s Loch. The best way to climb is from the east by Dunsapie Loch.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Duddingston</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Located at the northeast end of Dunsapie Loch, this area is tranquil with a village feel. One of Scotland\''s oldest pubs, the Sheep Heid Inn, over six centuries old, is found in this quaint village.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bruntsfield, Marchmont and Morningside</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">These southern suburbs offer large open spaces such as The Meadows and Bruntsfield Links. It is also the site of the medieval Burgh Muir (town heath) — used to isolate dying victims of plagues and for training armies. Marchmont is a popular student area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Leith</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A docklands area, Leith feels quite separate from the rest of the city - people here often prefer to say they\''re from Leith rather than from Edinburgh. It has its own financial center, waterway (the water of Leith) and shopping/eating areas. A source of inspiration for Irvine Welsh\''s \"Trainspotting\", it is today the scene of a thriving café society. Leith Links, the park where the rules of golf were originally formulated, is a lovely place to stroll. The sport has been prohibited on this ground, however, since 1907.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (710,'<div class=\"OverviewText\">In 1795, the Hudson\''s Bay Company established Fort Edmonton, a trading post where the Cree and the Blackfoot brought their much-coveted furs for barter. Over the course of some 200 years, Edmonton has evolved from this desolate outpost into a proud provincial capital. Thanks to the Klondike Gold Rush in the late 1800s, the building of the Alaska Highway in the 1940s, and the discovery, also in the 1940s, of phenomenal amounts of crude oil within a 40-kilometer (25-mile) radius of the city, Edmonton has earned its status as a transportation hub, supply center and industrial capital. But, beneath this business-like façade, there is much more to this small city, dubbed the \"Gateway to the North.\" New buildings are always under construction and new neighborhoods are continually being tacked on to the outskirts. Edmonton has the feel of a young, vibrant, yet not-too-cosmopolitan city, and its beauty and simplicity often surprise visitors.The grid design and the numbering system of Edmonton\''s streets and avenues make getting around in the older parts of the city easy. Streets run north to south, starting with zero in the east. Avenues run east to west, starting with zero in the south. In some of the newer residential neighborhoods, a map is essential, as the boulevards, lanes, and crescents are named. There are a few remaining traffic circles, and knowing the rules that govern them is a must. Get a friendly Edmontonian to explain, or give the local police or Alberta Automobile Association a call. Apart from those cautions, driving around this city of just over 600,000 people is relatively easy. Although native Edmontonians complain about \"rush hour,\" newer residents and visitors hardly notice the few extra minutes it adds to travel time. Edmonton Transit System (ETS) buses cover the whole of the city, and an efficient telephone service called BusLink helps riders plan the best route to wherever they are going. The LRT, ETS\''s Light Rail Transit, runs partly underground and partly above. It services the downtown core along Jasper Avenue, crosses the river to the university in the south, and runs north about 20 blocks to Northlands Park, the largest exhibition facility in Western Canada.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Music, visual art, theater, or just plain fun - there is definitely something for everyone. Late in June, the Yardbird Jazz Festival features jazz and blues artists at various indoor and outdoor venues throughout the city. And, the International Street Performers Festival fills the downtown streets with the antics of clowns, jugglers, magicians, and other performers. Thousands flock to Hawrelak Park for the Heritage Festival, a delightful celebration of ethnic diversity. The 50 pavilions showcase the costume, music, dance, food, and art of a specific culture each. Edmonton\''s Folk Music Festival, held every August at Gallagher Park, is recognized as one of the top folk festivals in North America. It has featured well-known performers like Jackson Browne and Joan Baez, as well as Canada\''s own Bruce Cockburn and Blue Rodeo. When the sun goes down, the lights of downtown start to glow, and the music strikes a chord somewhere within, you\''ll know you\''re having \"a folk festival moment.\" The end of summer is marked by the Fringe Theatre Festival, a lively event that takes place in Old Strathcona and features all types of \"alternative\" performances at both indoor and outdoor venues.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The nearly acoustically-perfect Francis Winspear Centre for Music is the home of the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, which maintains a busy schedule, satisfying a variety of musical tastes through a wide range of programs such as the Masters Series, the Lighter Classics, and Symphony for Kids. The Winspear is also host to internationally renowned singers and musicians. Edmonton Opera performances take place at the Jubilee Auditorium, located on the University of Alberta campus. The Skyreach Centre and Commonwealth Stadium can accommodate larger audiences, and often feature popular rock and pop artists.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Edmonton\''s premiere live theater facility is the Citadel Theatre, where top actors from across the country perform in a variety of classical and modern plays. There are also several smaller, more intimate theaters, where you can see talented local actors perform.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In every corner of the city you can find a \"first-run\" cinema, and West Edmonton Mall\''s super-deluxe Scotiabank Theatre Edmonton, complete with fire-breathing dragon, is worth a visit. Two of Edmonton\''s oldest cinemas, the Princess and the Garneau, both located in Old Strathcona, play a combination of alternative, first-run, and repertory films.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Thanks to Wayne Gretzky, everyone who knows anything about hockey has heard of the Edmonton Oilers, a team that draws a big local crowd during its home games at the Rexall Place. Commonwealth Stadium is the home of the Edmonton Eskimos, the city\''s professional football team. There are seldom sell-out crowds at any of these games, which is good news for visitors who want to see these teams in action.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums & Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Royal Alberta Museum hosts world-class exhibits. One of the museum\''s permanent exhibits, the \"Syncrude Gallery of Aboriginal Culture,\" offers a rare insight into the history and culture of America\''s native peoples.  TELUS World of Science houses an Imax Theater, a star theater, an observatory, a discovery gallery for children, and three exhibit galleries, the themes being the environment, forensics, and health. A museum with a difference is the Muttart Conservatory, located in the river valley. Its impressive glass pyramids house flowers and plants from tropical, temperate, and arid climates. The Art Gallery of Alberta exhibits the work of Canadian and international artists, and even has a rental and sales gallery. The smaller galleries in the vicinity of Jasper Avenue and 124 Street, along what has appropriately been dubbed the \"Gallery Walk,\" exhibit works mainly by Albertan and Canadian artists.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Edmonton is not well-known for its nightlife, but ask around and you\''re sure to hear mention of a few tried and tested stalwarts that are well-worthy of their repute. The Black Dog Freehouse is one of these - a casual pub with an inviting dive bar ambiance that hosts a stellar line up of DJs, live music and movie screenings throughout the year. In summer, the Blackdog opens its rooftop patio to eager Edmontonians hoping to make the most of the pleasant weather. Woodwork, on the other hand, is best known for its eclectic, inventive and ever-changing cocktail menu, fashioned from the finest barrel-aged spirits. The Pint is the place to catch the big game and groove along to 90s music, while Blues on Whyte is Edmonton\''s legendary destination for live blues. For country music, there\''s Knoxville\''s and the Cook County Saloon, and The Common is a popular gastro-lounge that attracts a more upmarket clientele. The city may not be a party capital, but with such a wide berth of options to explore, evenings in Edmonton are most certainly not dull.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The West Edmonton Mall is really a one-stop, entertainment, shopping, dining, and nightclub complex. This mammoth shopping center is reputed to be one world\''s largest, unmatched by any other in North America, with over 800 shops and a whole host of entertainment options. It even has an amusement park, a full-size waterpark, a skating rink, and a mini golf course. It\''s a city within a city! Southgate Centre and South Edmonton Common are alternate avenues for shopping. Although not as large as the West Edmonton Mall, they feature an impressive array of shops, restaurants, and cafes, and are a healthy mix of big-name brands and local boutiques.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (718,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">River Valley</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The North Saskatchewan River snakes its way through Edmonton, from southwest to northeast, cutting the city in half. The river valley parkland - the largest stretch of urban parkland in North America - is a playground for all seasons. More than 100 kilometers (62 miles) of multi-use trails, which accommodate walking, jogging, in-line skating, cycling, and cross-country skiing wind through a green corridor of park after park. Nestled in the valley along with some quaint residential neighborhoods are golf courses, campgrounds, skating ponds, tobogganing hills, and downhill ski areas.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown Edmonton sits high on the north bank of the river, bordered on the west by the domed, granite and sandstone Legislative Building, and on the east by the castle-like Hotel MacDonald. The main downtown drag—a popular \"cruising\" route with young people—is Jasper Avenue, also known as 101 Avenue. Rice Howard Way, with its pubs and trendy cafes, is a block-long, cobblestone, pedestrian strip that is a favored hangout for the office crowd and weekend fun seekers. Churchill Square, a park in the center of downtown, plays host to many of the city\''s festivals, and is bordered by some of Edmonton\''s most important buildings: the glass pyramid-topped City Hall, the main branch of the Edmonton Public Library, the Francis Winspear Centre for Music and the Art Gallery of Alberta.Enclosed pedestrian walkways called \"pedways,\" both underground and overhead, connect most of the downtown buildings. They make getting around during Edmonton\''s \"eight months of winter,\" as the locals ruefully joke, a bit more bearable. Edmonton Tourism provides pedway maps.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chinatown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chinatown is a few blocks east of downtown. Lining 97th Street, and on its adjacent avenues, are inexpensive Chinese restaurants, grocery stores - where tofu is sold in tubs at a fraction of the cost of the pre-packaged stuff - gift and clothing stores, and \"pharmacies\" staffed by Chinese herbalists who can offer something for just about any ailment.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Old Strathcona</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Across the river from downtown is Old Strathcona, a neighborhood with many turn-of-the-19th-century buildings and homes. Each Saturday, Edmontonians flock to the popular Farmer\''s Market held in the old bus barns. Several of the storefronts along Whyte Avenue have been restored and evoke the feel of a small prairie town. One-of-a-kind shops, cafes, and coffeehouses make this part of the city a popular hangout for young and old.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">University of Alberta</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the west end of Whyte Avenue lies the University of Alberta, one of Canada\''s most respected universities, and one of the largest research institutions in the country. More than 30,000 students in 15 faculties study in a tasteful mix of historic and modern buildings, many of which overlook the river.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The West End</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The West End, as Edmontonians refer to it, is almost a city within a city. Residential neighborhoods, mega grocery and hardware stores, an abundance of hotels and restaurants, and the presence of every kind of service imaginable make this one of the most congested areas in the city. The West End\''s landmark, West Edmonton Mall, is reputed to be the largest shopping mall in the world, with 800+ shops, services, and attractions.Edmonton\''s most fashionable neighborhoods line the banks of the North Saskatchewan. They are, for the most part, residential, with the most spectacular homes facing the river, visible only from a boat or canoe.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (721,'<div class=\"OverviewText\">Lying low in the Tanana Valley, Fairbanks takes up a central space in the Land of the Midnight Sun. Blessed with a pristine frontier much like other parts of Alaska, Fairbanks is the gateway that leads to Denali in the south and the Arctic Circle further north. Its wintry disposition makes it a hotbed for outdoor activities like snowshoeing, skiing and ice-sledding, and it is also the starting point for the Yukon Quest - a fascinating dog-sled race held annually.  Summers are short-lived, yet warm, carpeting its otherwise steely landscape in full bloom. The Georgeson Botanical Garden is a good place to witness this phenomenon. Its magnetism for adventure notwithstanding, Fairbanks\'' mainland features many a diverse attraction. Whether it is a brush with its gold rush history, its innate cultural pull or its artistic pursuits, Fairbanks transcends its geographically endowed limits. Fairbanks is the largest city in the Alaskan Interior, and is bordered by the Chena River to its west.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (727,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fairbanks wears its glorious history proudly, as is evident from its well-maintained museums. The best place to explore Alaska\''s golden past is at Pioneer Park, where the history of the Gold Rush is brought alive through various museums and exhibits. Make a stop at the Tanana Valley Railroad Museum to see the original locomotive that played a huge part during the frenzied era of the Gold Rush. Nearby, the Pioneer Air Museum explains the city\''s brush with the aviation industry, through varying exhibits such as maps, flight instruments and aircrafts from the bygone era. Closer to Downtown, the Fairbanks Community Museum traces the city\''s history through trying times such as the 1967 floods, its proficiency in the sport of Dog Mushing, and the Klondike Gold Rush. Another museum that pays tribute to Fairbanks\'' natural phenomena, such as the Aurora Borealis, is the Museum of the North, located at the University of Alaska. The Fountainhead Antique Auto Museum is also a popular museum that is home to 70 vintage cars from the post-Gold Rush era.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Several of Fairbanks\'' art galleries house artwork inspired by Alaska\''s dramatic landscape, and are well worth a visit. The lesser known Rose Berry Alaska Art Gallery at the UAF Museum of the North displays the myriad facets of Alaskan heritage and geography through unusual exhibits. From ivory carvings that date back 2000 years, to captivating Alaskan art, the museum transports you back in time. Must see exhibits include the permanent exhibition by John Luther Adams, a beautiful installation that captures Alaska\''s unique climate and topography through different mediums such as music and lighting. The Alaska House Art Gallery is another storied museum. The brainchild of Alaskan artist Claire Fejes, the gallery displays several artworks created by Claire herself, besides those of 200 other local artists.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Located at a stone\''s throw from the Alaska Salmon Bake, the Palace Theatre brings alive the history of the \''Golden Heart City\'' of Fairbanks. One of its productions, the Golden Heart Revue, is a brilliant musical comedy about life in the city. At the Morris Thompson Cultural & Visitors Center, immerse yourself in the unique culture of the native Athabascan Indians with the Tanana Chiefs Conference Cultural Programs. The programs bring about a festive air through traditional dancing and music. The Davis Concerts Hall has a similar atmosphere during the annually held Fairbanks Summer Arts Festival and the Festival of Native Arts.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Concerts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fairbanks has a handful of live music venues that feature local flavor most weekends. Don\''t expect to see any big, recognizable performers here, as most venues play host to obscure local bands. But if local acoustic folk is something that interests you, haunts like Kodiak Jack\''s and The Blue Loon host live music nights on the weekends. Else, listen to local musicians at the \''time out at Noon\'' concert held every Thursday in Pioneer Park. This hour-long concert lets you listen in on the latest local talent for free. If classical music is more to your liking, then the Davis Concerts Hall at the University of Alaska hosts the Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra every season.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Recreation</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fairbanks\'' rugged, snow-carpeted landscape is a favorable spot to engage in outdoor activities. Summer brings in relaxing activities like berry picking at the Murphy and Ester domes, to cycling along the peaceful scenery of the Ester Dome Singletrack Happy Valley Trail. Winter has a slew of activities planned for you, from traditional Dog Mushing tours, to chasing the soul-stirring Northern Lights. For more conventional winter adventures, plan a skiing trip at the Birch Hill Ski & Snowboard Area, or Skiland. Families with kids can take a trip to walk with Santa\''s helpers at the Running Reindeer Ranch.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (728,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown Fairbanks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A look at its city center, and it is hard to believe that this lively milieu coexists with the arduous climate of Alaska. The Golden Heart Plaza is the epicenter of most activities and landmarks in Fairbanks. With the river to one side, this picturesque area is teeming with art galleries, restaurants, local watering holes and small shops. As you stroll the city streets, you will see the occasional historic building along the way. Some of the buildings can be traced back to its glorious gold rush days. The Fairbanks City Hall is situated here as well. Downtown Fairbanks is also the gathering place for annual festivities, such as the Winter Carnival or the Midnight Sun Festival.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">West Fairbanks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The western corridor of Fairbanks is mostly famous for Pioneer Park. This outdoor museum and entertainment complex is a fairytale village in disguise. Lit up in twinkling lights when the winter sun gives way, Pioneer Park draws attention to the city\''s rich history. Housed within the park is the Pioneer Air Museum, the Tanana Valley Railroad Museum, a mini-golf playground, a center for arts and pavilion for playing. During summers, the park doubles up as a concert venue of sorts, with local musicians entertaining visitors.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fort Jonathan Wainwright</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lying toward the eastern end of Fairbanks, this region consists of largely underdeveloped land. It is primarily used as base for Ladd Army Airfield, a military airfield built in 1938. The only other landmark in the area is the Chena Bend Golf Course.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outlying Areas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Several of the city\''s prominent attractions are part of the larger Fairbanks area. The North Pole for instance, lies a short drive outside city limits. Don\''t mistake this for the legitimate pole that lies further north. Then again, a closer look at this suburb may have you rubbing your eyes in confusion, to fully ascertain the difference. This festive suburb has everything you hope to see in Christmas, right from Santa Claus\''s abode and reindeer, to teeny-sized snowflakes settling quietly on the ground. While you\''re here, make a trip to the neighboring Chena Lake Recreation Area. Besides being home to spectacular views of the Alaskan landscape, it is also the place to chase the elusive Northern Lights. The University of Alaska campus lies a little outside city limits, but is well worth the visit. Take in the spectacular architecture and explore mini attractions within, such as the Museum of the North, and the Georgeson Botanical Garden. This sprawling campus is also home to the Geophysical Institute and the Large Animal Research Station.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Florentine theatrical tradition has always been noteworthy, for example, the famous Teatro del Maggio attracts many well-known people to its classical music and opera offerings, as does Teatro della Pergola. See everything from ballet to comedy and classical music at the 19th-century Teatro Verdi in Santa Croce.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In Florence (and everywhere else) most people want to go out and stay out until late at the weekend; this city has a large number of bars and club, which people can enjoy any day of the week. For a quiet evening, drinking and chatting late into the night, why not try Caffè Pitti in Piazza Pitti, or Hemingway close to Santa Maria del Carmine. Zoe and Dolce Vita are a little more crowded and lively. Maybe you fancy a pint? The William is British in style, perhaps to meet the needs of the many ex-pats who make their home here! It sells a seemingly infinite number of beers, and snacks accompanied by good music and is populated by Florentine beer lovers and foreigners alike. Lots of tourists like to check out the clubs and discos when they are on holiday. Florence offers a great variety of nightspots and mainstream discos where you might meet a VIP or two, like Tenax.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Art and history lovers will be in heaven in Florence, with its world-class museums. Undoubtably the most famous in the city is the Uffizi Gallery, with its dazzling collection of fine art masterpieces like Botticelli\''s <em>Birth of Venus</em>. Admirers of sculpture can visit Michaelangelo\''s famous <em>David </em>at the Galleria dell\''Accademia. History and science combine at the fascinating Museo Galileo, where an impressive array of scientific artifacts, including some of Galileo\''s own astronomy tools, are on display. To learn more about the history of this magnificent city and see incredible murals by Da Vinci and Michaelangelo, visit the Palazzo Vecchio, then climb the tower for amazing views.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Historic Sights</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A bastion of art and architecture, Florence is replete with historic sights. Centuries ago, the city famously hosted the House of Medici, a prominent Italian banking family whose patronage helps explain Florence\''s nickname as the \"Birthplace of the Renaissance.\" Many of the city\''s most-cherished landmarks were sponsored by the Medicis, among them the Palazzo Vecchio, Uffizi Gallery, and Basilica of San Lorenzo, which doubles as the family\''s burial site. Other must-see historic sights in Florence include the massive Florence Cathedral and medieval Ponte Vecchio. Visitors to the Palazzo Vecchio can also enjoy the Piazza della Signoria conveniently located right out front. While you can\''t help but feel centuries of history coursing through the city\''s venerable streets, be sure to tour Florence\''s many old, impressive sights for incomparable insight into the Italian Renaissance and days past.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (746,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">San Giovanni (Duomo)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">San Giovanni takes its name from San Giovanni Battista (St. John the Baptist), patron saint of Florence, in whose honor the Baptistery was built. The historic city center is most representative of Florence. The layout of the district follows a road system created by the Romans known as the <em>cardus</em> and <em>decumanus</em> system. In the center, you will see the enormous, imposing structure of the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore. Referred to most commonly as the Duomo, with its cupola designed by Filippo Brunelleschi, the beautiful dome adds splendor to the city skyline. The city has also preserved its medieval network of streets, lined with regular, geometric Renaissance palaces such as the Palazzo Strozzi and Palazzo Medici-Riccardi, which once belonged to Florence\''s powerful, oligarchic families. Florence is divided into five districts and the center is divided into four sections (San Giovanni, Santa Croce, Santa Maria Novella and Santo Spirito). The university and the Tribunale di Firenze (which is housed in the Complesso di San Filippo Neri) are also in this district.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Santa Maria Novella</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Named after the Santa Maria Novella Basilica, a Dominican basilica and important cultural center during the Middle Ages, the district of Santa Maria Novella covers the area west of the train station of the same name, where a majority of affordable hotels and the city\''s largest park is located. Not far from the station is the Fortezza da Basso, a former stronghold of the city which is now used as an important center for conferences, conventions and exhibitions. The zone is also home to the Parco delle Cascine, one of the city\''s green oases. In this district also lies exclusive boutiques that are concentrated in a few of the most well-known streets, such as Via de\'' Tornabuoni and Via della Vigna Nuova. Via de\'' Tornabuoni is famous for being home to some of Italy\''s most prestigious designer boutiques such as Florentine Salvatore Ferragamo.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Santa Croce</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Santa Croce is named after Santa Croce Basilica, a medieval Franciscan basilica. The National Central Library is also located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Santo Spirito (Oltrarno)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The entire stretch of the side of the river opposite the majority of the city\''s tourist attractions, the Oltrarno is home to many locals, small eateries and amazing tourist sights such as San Frediano in Cestello and San Niccolò Oltrarno Church. At its heart is probably one of the most incredible Renaissance churches and piazzas: the Piazza Santo Spirito, which has retained much of its historic charm and is filled with workshops of the city\''s traditional artisans. This piazza is the place for parties on summer evenings, bringing together young Florentines and foreigners, many of whom live in this area. The Palazzo Pitti with its old Medicean garden and the Boboli Gardens are both in Oltrarno. The famous Piazzale Michelangelo with its panoramic view is also in this district. From here, it is possible to see one of the few remaining stretches of medieval wall around the Belvedere that was spared from demolition in the 19th Century. Included in this is the lovely medieval gate of the Porta Romana.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Campo di Marte & Fiesole</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Campo di Marte is located outside of what used to the be the medieval city wall and is home to many historical buildings dating back to the early 20th Century, as well as many modern stone and cement apartment blocks which were built after World War II. There are also numerous sports venues, athletic facilities and the Stadio Artemio Franchi, the ancient town of Fiesole, and the Bellariva zone are close by.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Gavinana & Galluzzo</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Gavinana and Galluzzo are south of the Arno and lead to the well-known Chianti wine region. On the southwestern side lies Galluzzo, famous for its Carthusian monastery.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Isolotto & Legnaia</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Combining areas of the city that were developed during the 1960s and 1970s (and are still expanding!), Isolotto and Legnaia are home to commuters and enormous American hotel chains.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rifredi</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rifredi is in the northwestern part of the city where, by the 15th Century, the Medici had already constructed some of their many country villas, including Villa Medici at Careggi and the villas of Castello and La Petraia in the Castello. In this district there are also several industrialized, residential zones, such as Novoli, Firenze Nova, Brozzi, Le Piagge and l\''olmatello. Brozzi is host to many Chinese and African immigrants. The influx of immigrants means that even a city like Florence cannot live forever in the past but must create a new multi-ethnic history.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Fort Myers is also the winter home of the Boston Red Sox and Minnesota Twins.Bordered by twin rows of palm trees, a stroll along McGregor Boulevard is a must to witness first hand why Fort Myers is nicknamed the \"City of Palms.\" As you move further away from the city center, residential neighborhoods give way to open spaces like the Six Mile Cypress Slough Preserve and Lakes Regional Park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cape Coral</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Northwest of Fort Myers, Cape Coral was originally laid out to resemble the Venice of Italy on the Gulf of Mexico. The man-made canal systems were instrumental in its residential, and commercial growth and expansion. There are many popular outdoor attractions here, such as the Sun Splash Family Waterpark. With more than 30 parks, there are also numerous boardwalks and trails for visitors to explore. The Cape Coral Historical Society Museum provides an educational respite.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sanibel Island</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Southwest of Fort Myers is the popular island of Sanibel. With a reputation for great fishing, windsurfing, shell collecting, bird watching and other outdoor pursuits, the best way to get around the island is by bicycle. Visit the Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum and the Sanibel Gallery. Golf and tennis are available at the Dunes Golf and Tennis Club, on the eastern end of the island, at the Sanibel Harbour Resort & Spa. The J. N. \"Ding\" Darling National Wildlife Refuge, is another must-see for nature lovers and outdoors enthusiasts.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Captiva Island</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Upper Captiva, at the northern end of Sanibel Island, is about 4.5 miles long and a half mile wide. It is mostly a wildlife sanctuary and a secluded retreat. This barrier island is a great place to view dolphins, birds, and beautiful sunsets.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fort Myers Beach</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fifteen minutes south of Fort Myers along the Gulf coast is Fort Myers Beach. A popular retreat for vacationers with many quaint restaurants and unique hotels like the Pointe Estero Beach Resort, it offers charter fishing, cruises, and tours to neighboring islands and as far as Key West. Entertainment can be found at Indian Creek Plaza.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

With over half a million residents and a large immigrant community, Frankfurt displays all the signs of a unique city to visit.Ever since the first trade fair took place here in the Middle Ages, Frankfurt has been shaped by business and commerce. \"Bankfurt\" is home to over 400 banks including the European Central Bank and Bundesbank, as well as continental Europe\''s biggest Stock Exchange.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

A must for art lovers is the Städel Museum, home to an enormous collection of European paintings from the Middle Ages to the present day, including works by masters such as Rubens, Holbein and Rembrandt. Another top address for art is the Schirn Kunsthalle, which hosts some fantastic temporary exhibitions and displays. The Museum of Modern Art (MMK) exhibits works by the likes of Joseph Beuys and Andy Warhol.  Nature lovers and archaeologists will get their money\''s worth in the Senckenberg Research Institute & Natural History Musuem, where, amongst other things, you can marvel at the enormous skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Film lovers should pay a visit to the National Film Museum, while fashion enthusiasts can check out the latest designer wear, as well as the crazes of yesteryear, at the German Leather Museum (DLM) in Offenbach. Frankfurt also has dozens of other museums, as well as numerous art galleries, many of which are well worth a visit.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater & Opera</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Frankfurt has two opera houses: the Oper Frankfurt and the older Alte Oper. Both houses are host to a constant stream of operas and concerts by an array of international artists. The Schauspiel Frankfurt is a good bet for traditional German theater, while more experimental pieces are performed at places like the Künstlerhaus Mousonturm. If you prefer your plays in English, then head to the English Theatre or the Internationales Theater, which also showcases Russian and Italian productions.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There\''s something for everyone here! For rock, head to MTW in Offenbach, to das Rind in Rüsselsheim or Batschkapp in Frankfurt. Hardcore techno enthusiasts shouldn\''t miss Tanzhaus West. Frankfurt\''s most popular nightlife hotspot is the area known as Konstablerwache, which gets particularly busy over weekends.  If you prefer things a bit quieter, then there are plenty of bars and bistros where you can have a chat over a beer, a cocktail or a glass of cider. The district of Sachsenhausen is a particularly good starting point for a night out on the town. Most of its Irish pubs and cider pubs are very popular.  On the weekend, Frankfurt\''s gay community meets at cult venues like the three-decade old Birmingham Pub for a pre-party drink. Harveys is a bit more up-market, and is particularly popular during the daytime when gay couples meet here for breakfast. Much bigger, but a fair way out of town, is the MS Connexion in Mannheim; a huge bar-cum-club that stretches out over several floors. Their Gaywerk evening is particularly popular.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Football fans should head straight for the Commerzbank Arena, where Eintracht Frankfurt seem locked in an eternal (but hitherto successful) battle against the relegation from the Bundesliga. Another local attraction is the Frankfurter Lions ice hockey team. Other highlights on Frankfurt\''s sporting calendar include the Henninger Turm bike race and the ATP tennis tournament in the Messe Frankfurt exhibition center.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

This is partly due to the city\''s age and partly due to its dynamic growth.

Cuirt delivers a week of literary happenings, featuring a range of Irish and international writers giving lectures or reading from their work. Assorted debates and a multitude of book launches are also on offer over the seven days, with discussions often continuing into the wee hours. The Galway International Arts Festival takes place in July, when the festival season is in full swing and culture vultures from all over flood into the city. It is the biggest arts festival in Ireland, and features an eclectic program of theater events over the space of two weeks, including Macnas\'' celebrated nighttime parade. The festival also incorporates open air music gigs, which have included the Beastie Boys and David Gray in past summers. The Galway Film Fleadh, a film festival boasts an impressive range of new Irish and international cinema screened over six days, as well as a series of workshops and masterclasses for aspiring filmmakers. Booking well in advance for all events is highly recommended, as seasoned Galway residents shrewdly snap up tickets early.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The winter months in Galway sees a very slight abatement in cultural production as well as a welcome respite from the crowds of the summer events. Galway has three theater spaces in the city center and more venues dotted around its periphery, all of which host productions throughout the year. The Town Hall Theatre hosts larger productions, from drama to musicals to opera, and also showcases festival events. An Taibhdhearc theater presents both English and Irish language plays and the intimate space of the Druid Theatre hosts a range of impressive drama productions. Myriad theater companies have made Galway their home, including Druid and Macnas, whose productions are internationally praised.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Live Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Galway is also home to some of the finest traditional music (and musicians) in the country. \"Trad\", as it\''s called locally, can be heard in various pubs around the city, but one of the best for live <em>seisúns</em> is the Crane on Sea Road. Again, these sessions can be better in the winter, when the fires are lit and the tourist hordes are gone. The Roisin Dubh, five minutes from the Crane on Dominick Street, is one of the best music venues in Ireland, hosting an eclectic mixture of bands and solo singer/songwriters. Everyone from the Handsome Family to The The to the Frames has played at this canalside venue. Other favorites for traditional Irish music include the Taaffes Bar, Tig Choili and Monroe\''s Live.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Art Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Equipped with a rich seaside history along the River Corrib where the city began its humble beginnings as a sleepy fishing village, it is no surprise that a city as colorful and diverse as Galway should have a prized repertoire of historical museums. Local gems like the Claddagh Ring Museum and the Galway City Museum tell riveting tales about little-known facets of the city\''s historical past. The lesser-known Galway Fisheries Watchtower Museum, a riverside museum that watches over the historic Spanish Arch, is one of Galway\''s tiniest museums, and enthralls visitors with archaic collections, photographs, the river\''s storied trading past. It also offers picturesque views of the town below.  Galway also has a burgeoning arts scene, and several regional artists find inspiration from the city\''s magical panorama and seaside landscapes, incorporating its inherent mystique in their artworks. One such gallery where you can find Connemara\''s soulful scenery adapted seamlessly into paintings is the Whitehorn Gallery near Clifden. The Spiddal Crafts village, home to one of the city\''s most artistic communities, showcases everything from fine art specialties, to ceramic works, colorful textiles and more. If you prefer your arts in the form of quiet contemplation, both the refurbished Galway Arts Centre on Dominick Street and Kenny\''s Gallery on Middle Street feature exhibitions of painting, photography and sculpture. These incorporate Irish and international artists and change regularly.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In a city blessed with spectacular views, enjoying the pleasures of the outdoors is a must. Galway offers an arsenal of activities for anyone who wishes to venture out. To drink in the beauty of Ireland\''s rugged landscape, follow the sinuous stretch of the Derroura Mountain Bike Trail that leads you to astounding views of Lough Corrib. Diving is a popular activity as well, and spots like the Connemara, Killary Harbour and Trá An Doilín are amazing places to watch some glorious marine life. Else, try kayaking on the Galway Bay, or surf along the beaches of Lahinch and Fanore. Alternatively, the Rusheen Bay Windsurfing School offers fantastic lessons in the sport.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (792,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">City Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city center is comprises of a small, coastal town with its roots in the thirteenth century. The streets are narrow and the older buildings cluster cozily together. In this area of the city, many of the buildings and architectural artifacts still testify to Galway\''s long history.The focal point of the city center is</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">John F. Kennedy Park, or as it is still known by the locals (Galwegians), Eyre Square. Re-named in the 1970s, JFK Park is a picture postcard scene of greenery and trees, the openness of which is in contrast to the narrow streets which mark each corner. Home to the old city gates and its defending cannon, the vista provided gives a glimpse into the Galway\''s less than peaceful past. One of the more peaceful residents of the Square is Padraig O Conaire. Renowned writer and carouser, O Conaire\''s statue has stood (almost) undisturbed since its erection in the first half of the 1900s. JFK Park is also home to a more modern sculpture, the \''galway Hooker\'', which despite its suggestive name, is none other than a sculpture of a type of fishing boat used in the waters around Galway Bay for well over one hundred years.For those fond of nightlife, the city center will not fail to please. The greatest concentration of pubs and clubs is to be found in the center, with practically every taste catered for. Galway is famous for its live music, particularly the traditional music sessions, often impromptu, which can be found in many of the pubs in the central area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Docks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Galway is a coastal city, and has its own Docklands area. Previously a less than attractive section of the city, the dockside has been revamped beyond recognition. New attractive apartment blocks have replaced warehouses and storage containers. While most of the oceangoing traffic passing through the Galway docks is commercial, it is not uncommon to see pleasure boats docked here, and if you are lucky, you may be witness to the breathtaking sight of a fully rigged clipper ship moored for a short stay.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Claddagh</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As we head north-west of the city center, the next area of note is the Claddagh. The original town encompassed little more than the Claddagh, and true to this tradition, there is still a king (of sorts) in residence in the area. While the \''king of the Claddagh\'' has no administrative or ruling power, he is still an indelible feature of this characterful place, the residents of which are intensely proud of their heritage as residents of the original seaside town which became Galway. The world famous Claddagh Ring is named after this area also, and while the jury is still out on the origin of this evocative design, it would be ill-advised to question its authenticity as a historical object unique to Galway in the earshot of any true Galwegian. Claddagh, located not far away from the Spanish Arch</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">,</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">is also home to St Mary\''s Church, the Claddagh National School, and Claddagh Arts Centre.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Salthill and surrounds</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Further along the coast is the seaside resort of Salthill. Salthill has traditionally been the destination of choice for generations of sea lovers. Most of the development in and around Salthill took place in the last forty years, but the lengthy beaches have been an attraction for locals and visitors alike for much longer. Salthill was originally a seaside resort in the same vein as north-west England\''s Blackpool, although on a smaller scale. However, the last ten years has seen much investment and development in the area to ensure that it keeps right up to the mark when it comes to an enjoyable seaside holiday. The Salthill Promenade, also known as The Prom, a scenic windswept area that stretches languorously along the sinuous stretch of the bay, is a wonderful place for a stroll. The Blackrock Beach and Diving Tower, known for its high-octane fund-raising event that requires intrepid participants to leap off the tower into the sea, is also located here. The breezy area of Salthill also finds a mention in the famous Irish song<em> The Galway Girl</em>, penned by Steve Earle. The road west from Salthill leads into picturesque Barna and Furbo, villages worth visiting for their scenic qualities alone. These areas also mark the beginning of the Galway Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking area). This region is steeped in old Irish culture, and the native Irish language is often predominant, with English spoken only to accommodate outsiders.The Gaeltacht area is not only along the coastline. Bleak and rugged Connemara to the north and west of Galway city is also part of this culturally rich vicinity. Much of this area is included within the Connemara National Park and so is protected from unsympathetic development. From Newcastle, in the north of Galway city, the road leads towards Moycullen and on to Oughterard, where, like its seaside relatives, the Irish language and culture still flourish.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">University and surrounds</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Newcastle Road, to the east of the city, is also the address of the National University of Ireland, Galway (University College Galway). This university is rich in old-school academic values and tradition on the one hand, yet is right up to date with the newest technological developments. This can be seen quite clearly in the architecture of the many buildings which comprise the university. The original university buildings, which date from the mid-nineteenth century, combine with the latest in contemporary building design. A visit to Galway is never complete without a visit to its oldest seat of education.The south-eastern parts of Galway tend more towards the residential, with Galway\''s oldest housing estate, Mervue, to be found on the main Galway-Dublin road. Also in this area are Ballybane and Renmore. This off-center development of the city gives a slightly unbalanced picture of its population, with most of the residential density on one side of the city. This gives rise to a community spirit which may be less and less a factor in urban and suburban living, but is still a central part of Galway life.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outlying Areas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">South of the city lies County Clare, home of the Burren. This region has also been designated a National Park and is home to a landscape unlike any other—the great limestone flagstones of the Burren shelter a ecosystem unique in the world. Finally, at the mouth of Galway Bay lie the Aran Islands. The three islands are included in the Galway Gaeltacht and maintain their own distinctive traditions in spite of the many visits from tourists. The landscape of the islands is bleak and unforgiving—great cliffs rise sheer from the sea and the magnificent ring fort of Dun Aenghus perches right on the cliff edge.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (794,'<div class=\"OverviewText\">Located at the extreme south-western corner of Switzerland, Geneva is surrounded by French territory. Its location, on the banks of Lake Léman between the Alps and the Jura mountains, provides a dramatic landscape and allows easy access to ski runs, vineyards, spas, and historic towns. Geneva is compact and easily explored on foot. It is also exceptionally green, with a great number of parks and walkways in and around the city center.Mark Twain visited Geneva so often towards the end of the 19th Century that American literary magazines began to fear he had taken up residence. The writer was certainly intrigued by the Old City\''s labyrinth of narrow, angular streets, finding the Reformist-named Rue d\''enfer, and Rue du Purgatoire (Hell and Purgatory streets) particularly curious.The geographic feature dominating the city is, of course, Lake Léman. This immense body of fresh water is the largest and bluest of all the lakes in Switzerland. Locals may be tolerant if you refer to it as \"Lake Geneva,\" but if you are planning a day trip to Lausanne or Evian, remember that Geneva is not the only city bordering the lake. The arrival of warm weather in the city heralds the opening of lakeside terraces and beaches, the most well-known being the Bains de Pâquis — which is set up for swimmers and <em>café habitués</em>. Viewing the cityscape by boat is highly recommended as stunning views of the Jet d\''eau and the Savoy mountains are to be beheld.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Highlights of the collection include: Rodin sculptures, paintings by Modigliani, Renoir, Cézanne and Swiss artists as well as an impressive Egyptology section. Unique in Switzerland, the Musée d\''histoire des Sciences focuses mainly on the work of Genevese scientists, who were especially prodigious in the 18th Century. Some curious old scientific instruments are also on show. Maison Tavel,another Swiss gem was purchased by City of Geneva in 1963. One of Switzerland\''s most important models of civilian medieval construction, this house is now a museum committed to presenting the city\''s urban and sociological history. At the Institut et Musée Voltaire, one can learn more about the author who lived for five years in this delightful house during the mid-18th Century. With a large collection of manuscripts dealing with Voltaire and his time, the library and museum also exhibits paintings, sculptures and items belonging to the writer.  From a 21st-century perspective, the Musée d\''art Moderne et Contemporain (MAMCO) holds frequent exhibitions of contemporary art. MAMCO houses a noteworthy pop art selection, including works by Warhol and Lichenstein. Le Petit Palais has an eclectic collection of predominantly late 19th-and early 20th-century works. The Centre de la Photographie within the Grütli Arts Center is dedicated to fine art photography. Over ten exhibitions are held each year, with a strong focus on individual photographers and their ideas.  Musée Rath on the Place Neuve only shows temporary exhibitions of international and Swiss art. Exhibitions are often thematic or major retrospectives of one artist\''s output. A startling array of Asiatic art is on display at the Collections Baur. Noted collector Alfred Baur collected these Chinese ceramics, jade pieces and Japanese prints dating from the 8th to the 18th Centuries until his death in 1956. Another private museum, the Musée Barbier-Müller holds 5500 tribal and classical pieces of art in addition to sculptures, textiles and ornaments from primitive civilizations.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinemas are abundant in the city. A large percentage of films are shown in their original versions. The Grütli Art Center\''s two screens show a mixture of director retrospectives and art-house films. Also away from the mainstream, Les Scala is an independent cinema showcasing non-Hollywood works from around the globe. The best of the big complexes is Cinéma Pathé at Balexert. With ultra-modern seating and sound, its 13 cinemas are a hugely comfortable and practical way to see blockbusters.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Live concerts are held daily in the city. Victoria Hall is one of the most beautiful venues for classical music, with stunning acoustics. The Bâtiment des Forces Motrices opera house has a unique location: in the middle of the Rhône. Theatrical productions, ballet performances and musical concerts are often held here.  The Association pour l\''encouragement de la Musique Improvisée (AMR) offers acting workshops to the community and puts on plays for the public at various venues throughout the city. Le Chat-Noir in Carouge is a jazz and rock club that frequently hosts local DJs as well. L\''usine is mostly known for its rock concerts and cutting edge electronic shows. One of the largest venues in Geneva is SEG Geneva ARENA, where big international acts come to play to the cheers of huge crowds.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Recreation</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Geneva\''s gorgeous beaches make for splendid summer playgrounds for tourists and locals alike, who can be seen swimming and frolicking in the pleasantly cool waters of Bains des Pâquis, Geneva Plage and Bains de Cressy. Those who prefer the call of the mountains over gilded coastlines can explore the hiking trails surrounding Geneva\''s Jura mountains. In winter, Geneva is also filled with skiing enthusiasts who flock to the many resorts that skirt the city, several of which can be reached within less than two hours. Other popular activities in Geneva are centered around its rivers, the Avre and the Rhone, and offer rafting and kayaking adventures.  &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (801,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">City Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It is difficult to isolate one point as being the city center. Historically, the Place du Bourg de Four in the Old City would have been the main focus. From a practical point of view it is tempting to bestow this honor on the building on the Pont-de-la-Machine, which traverses the Rue du Rhône, between the left and right banks of the lake. Housed here is a branch of Geneva\''s tourist information center. Free city maps and brochures can be picked up here or in the main office, located in the Central Post Office on the Rue du Mont-Blanc.From Cornavin towards Bel-Air, the Rive Droite has a high concentration of shops, hotels and restaurants. Always teeming with locals and tourists, the Manor Genève is a popular fashion chain here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Old City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A meeting place since Roman times, the Bourg-de-Four is at the heart of the Old City. The square, in reality more like a multi-leveled spiral, is dominated by café terraces, one being La Clémence next to the 18th-century fountain, book and antique shops and a very low-key police station.Among the notable sights in the area is the Cathédrale St-Pierre. More important for its role in history than its aesthetic beauty, the Cathedral comprises a miscellany of pieces tacked on through the centuries. Archaeologists have discovered the ruins of a Roman temple (350 CE) near the foundations of the Cathedral and the dig site is open to the public. For a superb view of the city, the North tower can be climbed for a small charge.Maison Tavel, at 6 rue Puits-de-St-Pierre, is the oldest house in Geneva. Now a city-owned museum, the multi-storey house exhibits objects from Geneva\''s past, with rooms decorated in period style. Another museum in this area, the Musée Barbier-Müller, holds a stunning collection of non-European artwork.Although it might be impossible to park a car in the old city, there is no problem finding a seat at the Promenade de la Treille. The 126-meter (413-foot) long wooden bench located there is the longest in the world. In addition, chestnut trees blossoming in this delightful square traditionally signal the start of spring.The tramway-lined shopping area a block from the Rue du Rhône and just below the old city is pretty much Geneva\''s main shopping street. Confusingly, this thoroughfare changes names every few hundred meters, from the Rue de la Confédération, near Bel-Air, to the Rue de Rive, which marks a border with the Eaux-Vives. Shopping Malls like the Centre Commercial Eaux-Vives 2000 and ESCADA are located here, and fast-food outlets and street-entertainment are also plentiful.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Les Pâquis</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Both trendy and notorious, the Pâquis Quarter is the closest Geneva has to a Bohemian neighborhood. The area was once used for grazing cows, but is now inhabited by a Red Light District as well as an increasing number of boutiques selling original art, clothes and jewelry. Food-wise, the range of cafés and restaurants in the Pâquis cannot be surpassed in the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Les Eaux-Vives</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Across the lake from the pulsating Pâquis, the Eaux-Vives is a bubbly area that lives up to the English translation of its name (\''rapids\''). Italian restaurants are abundant here. Small boutiques are dotted along the Rue des Eaux-Vives and side streets leading to the lake. An independent cinema, Les Scala, shows films in original versions on its three screens. The magnificent Parc des Eaux-Vives and La Grange comprises a huge expanse of green, the latter also features Roman ruins and an extensive rose-garden.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Carouge</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Located a few kilometers from the center of the city, Carouge has a distinctly different atmosphere from the rest of Geneva. Perhaps because, technically, the town is outside the city\''s jurisdiction, although part of the same Canton. Now home to fashionable artisans, boutiques and restaurants, Carouge is remarkably well-preserved. Once owned by the King of Sardinia, this area\''s low-rise, graceful buildings flaunt their Mediterranean influences. A restaurant highlight includes the Café des Négociants. Le Chat Noir is a hip live music venue and late-night bar that is located here as well.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cologny</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Known by some as the \"Beverly Hills\" of Geneva, Cologny is worth visiting for spectacular views over the lake. Many large estates are situated here, the most famous of which is the Villa Diodati on the chemin de Ruth. Byron stayed here during the summer of 1816, writing and touring the lake region with Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley. It is rumored that the idea for the novel <em>Frankenstein</em> came to Mary Shelley in a dream at the villa, after an evening of violent storms on the lake.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

It has nine screens, seats 3,000 and offers advanced technology, comfortable seats, and free parking. The building is in the Magazzini del Cotone in the old port area, and the largest two rooms were designed by Renzo Piano. They show commercial films but some quality works are assured by the Istituto Luce, a partner in the enterprise. national competition for short films, the Genoa Film Festival will take place here in June. In the city centre, the Universale has three large screens and Dolby surround sound. It offers commercial, quality films. For something slightly different, go to Il Corallo, which has two screens and more adventurous programs or the Ariston, which alternates between international and Italian.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Carlo Felice Theatre offers a varied selection of opera as well as jazz and rock concerts. The building was renovated in a post-modern style and has a capacity of 2,000. As for prose theater, the most classic offerings can be found in the Teatro della Corte, famous for its school that has produced many well known actors. It is also in a modern, well designed building.  Two large halls have diversified theater in Genoa in the last few years. Teatro Duse and Genovese halls offer a program of successful musicals and comedians who do television work. As for alternative theater, two places in Genoa offer an interesting choice. The Teatro della Tosse is now a favorite place for two great artists: comedy writer Tonino Conte and set designer Lele Luzzati. It produces its own shows and, during summer, organizes surprising events in old factories and abandoned forts.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Carlo Felice Theatre is the place to go to hear opera and classical music concerts as well as high quality jazz. There are also various places in Genoa that offer live music. The recently opened DLF offers an intense, ambitious program that is open to international music trends with a strong emphasis on sounds from the London club scene. It has a capacity for 1,300 people and serves as one of the best places to hear live music in the city. The program is developed by the same people who organize the only popular music festival in the region, the Goa-Boa in July.  The smaller music club circuit centers around the historic district. Quaalude was the first place in Genoa to open the way for underground music. Fitzcarraldo hosts sought after artists, even if the small location is not great for larger crowds, and Mascherona and the Palace offer a chance to hear live music as well, usually punk or rock.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The heart of the city\''s nightlife can be found in the historic center where the underground culture can be discovered in the alleyways surrounding historic palaces and monuments. It is not always easy to find what you are looking for, but this is all part of the game, and the style of the city. Most of the nighttime haunts are concentrated in area between Piazza Sarzana and Via San Lorenzo. During the day it is nice to wander around the backstreets here in search of some of the more hidden places in the city. There are some sophisticated wine bars to be discovered here such as Le Cantine Squarciafico and open-late tapas bars, such as La Lepre. The scene changes on the weekends, when the usually peaceful alleyways are taken over by lively crowds on their way to Cafè Latino in piazza Delle Erbe and Le Corbousier in piazza San Donato. These places are always packed, and the neighboring areas are full of cocktail and wine bars. This is a veritable epicenter of nightlife where you can barhop all night or go on to one of the clubs in the area or even go along to a disco like DLF.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (811,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Boccadasse</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Starting right on the water, Boccadasse is perhaps the most-visited neighborhood in the city. It sits on the sea and houses much of the tourist activity in Genoa. Be charmed by a waterfront stroll down main promenade Corso Italia and pacified by the soothing sounds of the Ligurian Sea. While there are a few landmarks in the area, such as the Chiesa di Sant\''antonio di Boccadasse, cultural opportunities largely revolve around the neighborhood\''s fishing history, so don\''t miss the chance to people watch over impossibly fresh seafood while in the area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Caruggi</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Offering as much character as Boccadasse under its slightly less shiny façade, the Caruggi district is dense with cultural attractions. Start your visit in the historic center, which makes for an excellent walking tour destination. Beginning in Strada Nuova, now known as Via Garibaldi, take in relics of the days when great, Genovese families were at their richest. Continue on and see sights like Via Garibaldi and the palatial structures it houses or venture to the famous Aquarium of Genoa. Eye-catching architecture is a mainstay of the Old City and those interested in touring historic churches, plazas, and museums may just want to head here first. Via Balbi is a particularly nice place to explore as it is rich with palaces and now houses the university buildings of the School of the Humanities. You\''ll also find nightlife opportunities in the bustling Caruggi neighborhood though visitors should be aware of the presence of pickpockets after dark.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sturla</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Moving outside the more touristic areas of Genoa, Sturla boasts a small but lovely beach and all the appeal of an authentic Italian neighborhood. It has stayed true to its fishing village roots and offers visitors a true taste of Genoese life, not to mention some tasty local dining options. Points of interest in Sturla include the Santissima Annunziata and San Celso churches, which preserve medieval architecture and house lovely artworks. And for a livelier activity, check out the <em>trallalero</em> folk music scene that pulses through the neighborhood.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Albaro</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Albaro is a residential area of Genoa where visitors can go for peaceful walkabouts replete with glimpses of hillside villas. Many of the residences found in the area are elegant and historic, built anywhere from the 16th century by aristocrats to the 19th century by the entrepreneurial elite. Catholic churches also dot the area, lending a bit of culture to the neighborhood. To surround yourself with elegance and enjoy the salty sea air in peace, be sure to stop by lovely Albaro.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

This downtown network of independent designer boutiques, high street brands and international luxury labels means you\''re sure to find something to pique your interest. With more than 200 stores to choose from, this area is a fashion lover\''s paradise. From local designers flexing their creative muscles to high-end fashion, Glasgow has it all!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\''re not into shopping, museums and galleries provide the best daytime diversion in the city. The area around Glasgow University, a particularly good spot for educational treats, has highlights such as Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum and the Museum of Transport. In the center of town, visit the controversial Gallery of Modern Art and make up your own mind. For a more spiritual dose of culture, St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art is an entertaining and educational way to pass a few hours. The People\''s Palace and Winter Gardens is the best place for finding out about local history and culture - its multimedia, interactive exhibits will keep the kids from complaining that they\''re bored. The streets around Trongate, just east of the center, are peppered with independent little art galleries, including the amazing kinetic sculptures of the Sharmanka Gallery and Workshop, which will delight and enthrall the whole family. Check out the Centre for Contemporary Arts on Sauchiehall Street for pop culture or have a walk around The Lighthouse if you\''re interested in architecture and design. Mackintosh fans will go mad over the House for an Art Lover, but if you can\''t be bothered making the trip to the south side, have a look at the Hunterian Art Gallery and Museum in the west end, which houses an excellent collection of original Mac pieces. If you only want one Glaswegian gallery on your schedule, marvel at the treasures that make up The Burrell Collection.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Historic Sites</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fed up with museums? Worship the medieval beauty of Glasgow Cathedral then check out Provand\''s Lordship next door; it\''s the oldest dwelling in Glasgow. If all the history gets oppressive, relax in one of the city\''s many parks. The sprawling Glasgow Green is in the east, while Kelvingrove Park, Botanic Gardens and Kibble Palace out west offer peace and quiet with squirrels to watch, statues to admire and greenhouses to explore.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater and the Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As the light fades, choose between noisy and civilized pursuits. Glasgow is blessed with a wealth of good writing and since the 1990 Year of Culture, theater has been a thriving presence in the city. The Citizens Theatre is widely regarded as the best in Scotland and the Theatre Royal often welcomes the Royal Shakespeare Company. The Arches and the Tron Theatre are great for cutting-edge drama, whilst King\''s Theatre is musical-land. Glasgow is home to the Scottish Ballet company as well as Scottish Opera, so lovers of high-brow culture will not be disappointed. Tramway is the place to go for performance art and the kind of groundbreaking work you won\''t catch elsewhere. For a bit of a laugh take in a show at comedy club The Stand.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinemas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are plenty of cinemas in town, the Odeon City Centre shows all the big Hollywood productions and the Glasgow Film Theatre has an excellent program of art-house and foreign films.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Feeling groovy? Slip on your glad rags and prepare for a night of funk and frolic The nightlife in Glasgow is difficult to fault, although it is worth noting that most clubs operate a curfew policy - if you\''re not in by around 12:30a, you might as well go home. With something for everyone, cheesy popsters can party as hard as professional techno-heads, and rock chicks can mosh in style. If live music is your bag, there are plenty of venues to try. Big names often pop up at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre and the Royal Concert Hall, but many bands prefer to play several nights at the smaller Barrowlands - a former ballroom - because the atmosphere is second to none. Gigs at King Tut\''s Wah Wah Hut feature fresh new talent and established names, whilst the 13th Note has salsa classes as well as top bands. On Sauchiehall Street Nice \''n\'' Sleazy is a great night out and the stage is often graced by the cream of the local music scene. For a taste of traditional folk music, pop into the Scotia Bar; it\''s one of Glasgow\''s oldest pubs and there\''s usually someone playing. Glasgow has many clubs to rave about. There\''s a high concentration on and around Sauchiehall Street; The Garage is a favorite with students and disco divas, whilst the Velvet Rooms attract an older clientele a few doors along. Alaska has a good mix of big name DJs and mainstream dance. The Cathouse near Central Station, has three floors of metal, industrial and goth madness. A mainstay of the gay and lesbian club-scene is the popular Polo Lounge, while, also in the Merchant City, Sugar Cube pulls in a sophisticated crowd. Serious clubbers head to The Sanctuary, which regularly plays host to famous guest DJs in a dynamite atmosphere.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (830,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Medieval City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Glasgow Cathedral, the easterly focal point from which the city developed, dominates the Medieval City. In fact, there is actually a mixture of Medieval, Georgian and Victorian architecture here. The cathedral precinct is also the site of Provand\''s Lordship, Glasgow\''s oldest house, built in 1471. Climb up to the top of the hill in The Necropolis cemetery where many local dignitaries are buried and be rewarded by an excellent panoramic view of the city below.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Merchant City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">East of George Square is a grid-plan of streets known as Merchant City. This area used to be a center of trade and many of the Tobacco Lords built elaborate mansions here. This section of the city is an example of 18th Century town planning. Georgian and Victorian buildings provide the area with an elegant sophistication, which is less evident elsewhere in the city. In recent years, Merchant City has again become a center of trade and it is now a fashionable residential and business address. It still looks a little shabby in places which are yet to undergo redevelopment, but stylish bars, hotels and restaurants abound and there are plenty of exclusive shops to flex platinum credit cards in, not to mention the prestigious Italian Centre.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Trongate and the East End</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">South of the Merchant City, Argyle Street, which runs through the city center, extends into Trongate. There are a lot of independent art galleries around here as well as some good bars and restaurants, such as Café Cossachok. The jewel in its crown has to be the Tron Theatre, a former church whose 17th-century steeple, all that remains of the original structure, makes an excellent landmark. Further along, Trongate meets High Street at Glasgow Cross, marked by the Tolbooth Steeple. Keep going east and head to the Barras market which is one of the best places to experience some Glasgow color. Glasgow Green and the People\''s Palace and Winter Gardens are also great attractions.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The City Centre</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Glasgow may seem to have many centers but the main area for shopping and nightlife is bordered by motorways to the north and west, the River Clyde to the south, and Merchant City and Trongate to the east. The main streets are pedestrianized here; Sauchiehall Street, Buchanan Street and Argyle Street. Look up and you\''ll discover many of the shops, however modern their fronts, are actually housed in beautiful Victorian buildings with ornate detailing. There are plenty of good shopping centers for a bit of retail therapy; the St Enoch Shopping Centre and Buchanan Galleries are worth a visit for high street stores, while Argyll Arcade houses lots of independent jewelers. However, the showpiece for shopping has got to be Princes Square, where you\''ll find the only Scottish branches of many upmarket and trendy stores. By day, the city center population tends to be comprised of suits, shoppers and students. By night, people head to the city for the theaters and cinemas, and the large selection of clubs, restaurants and bars.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The West End</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just as the cathedral dominates the Medieval district, so Glasgow University dominates the west end of the city; it\''s the fourth oldest in the UK. Its parkland setting and cosmopolitan vibe mix seamlessly with the fashionable, affluent feel of the surrounding area. The west end is like a separate little town, it even has its own river, the Kelvin. Apparently, there are more millionaires living in the Kelvinside area than anywhere else in Glasgow. There are also several museums here, including Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum and the Museum of Transport. Wander down the lanes off Byres Road and you\''ll find quirky little second-hand shops and independent boutiques. This district even has its own shopping center, De Courcey\''s Arcade. Restaurants are of a variety and quality to rival anything the city center has to offer and there\''s no shortage of hotels and bars either.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The South Side</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The area just south of the Clyde is characterized by housing estates, attractive residential streets and lush parkland, Bellahouston Park and Pollok Country Park to be precise. Both house fine collections of art, the Mackintosh House for an Art Lover in the former and The Burrell Collection in the latter. Theater-goers will love the Citizens Theatre here while those of a less cultural bent may enjoy a visit to Hampden Park at Mount Florida to watch American football or plain old soccer. Beyond the boundaries of Central Glasgow are new towns, which developed to meet the housing needs of the city\''s many immigrants over the past two centuries. Further out, there are market towns and pretty rural villages, striking coastal scenery, lochs and rivers.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

 (861,'<div class=\"OverviewText\">Guatemala\''s first street nomenclature was devised in 1855 when the Conservative Government decreed the use of proper names, such as Calle del Calvario, Calle de los Olvidos, or Calle de la Merced. The system was descriptive and easy to remember, but rapid growth of the city led to its replacement by a numbering method first proposed by the engineer Raúl Aguilar Batres in 1877. Despite its Byzantine complexity, this system is still used today. Streets from north to south are called \"Avenida\" and those from east to west are called \"Calle\". Each address has three numbers—\"1 Avenida 5-25\" for example—to indicate the street number and the approximate distance, in meters, from the nearest cross street. The distance in meters (in this case \"25\"), is odd for houses on the north side of a street (or avenue) and even for those on the south. Each address is determined by the Municipality of Guatemala.The zones of the city are also numbered. Using the center of the city as a starting point, numbers increase starting from the north then spiraling outwards, using main roads or geographic divisions as boundaries between each zone. The Avenida Aguilar Batres, for example, separates zones 11 and 12 and the Avenida Reforma divides zones 9 and 10. The logic behind this system is that the city can continue expanding without running out of zone names.

Public buildings were constructed in a Neo-Classical style and few of them had more than one floor.

Sailboats can be seen tacking up and down the harbor as early as May and as late as November. Fog is a rarity in this seaside city, due to the open harbor and cleansing breezes.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

It is more than factory chimneys and traffic jams—more than the screeching of seagulls, squeaking of trams and thundering of the railway—it is more than ships\'' horns, whirling cranes, curses and dance music—oh, it is so much more!\" Even writer Heinrich Heine, who did not always sing Hamburg\''s praises, returned again and again, just as many visitors do. Hamburg has an air about it: on the one hand, it is a busy and bustling metropolis; on the other, an elegant and cozy seaside idyll.

If you like light theater, head for the Komödie Winterhuder Fährhaus or St.Pauli-Theater, while Deutsches Schauspielhaus Hamburg and Ernst-Deutsch-Theater are top addresses for theatrical classics. Thalia Theater is well known for its innovative productions of modern pieces, such as the <em>Black Rider</em> by Burroughs, Waits and Wilson, or <em>Poetry</em> by Lou Reed and Robert Wilson. If you\''re in town with the kids, then they\''ll be spellbound by the performances at the Theater für Kinder, while the legendary Schmidt Theater on the Reeperbahn puts on brilliant variety shows for adults. Although modern and unassuming on the outside, the interior of Hamburg\''s Staatsoper (State Opera House) is one of the most opulent in the country, and hosts performances by many of the world\''s greatest ballet and opera stars. The best place for classical music is undoubtedly the Musikhalle - Laeiszhalle. Hamburg also has a reputation as being Germany\''s musical capital. At Operettenhaus, <em>LOVE NEVER DIES - Phantom II</em> and other spectacular shows make this theater a firm favorite. If you are interested in readings and literary events, pop into Hamburger Literaturhaus, which features regular readings by world famous authors.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Concerts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As most people here will be keen to tell you, The Beatles\'' route to world stardom began in Kaiserkeller, which has now been turned into a disco. Nowadays, top live acts perform above the Kaiserkeller in Hamburg\''s most prominent club, Große Freiheit und Kaiserkeller. Freiheit\''s arch rival, Disco im Docks, is located just around the corner and attracts equally prominent bands. Markthalle puts on gigs by lesser-known bands, and its atmosphere is second to none. Other blues, jazz and rock concerts take place in Fabrik, a former factory in Altona.  Hamburg also has several great venues for open-air gigs. The Volksparkstadion and Trabrennbahn Bahrenfeld regularly host top acts, but probably the best-known venue for open-air concerts is the Stadtpark. If all that\''s not enough for you, then head to Scheeßel for a whole weekend\''s worth of music at the annual Hurricane Festival.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums & Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Admittedly, Hamburg isn\''t known for being a particularly artsy city, but it does offer a host of interesting museums. Hamburger Kunsthalle is home to one of Germany\''s best collections of ancient and modern art, while the architecturally charming Deichtorhallen puts on some great contemporary art exhibitions. If you\''re interested in seafaring, then Altonaer Museum is the place for you, featuring figureheads from ancient galleons, as well as an impressive collection of models and nautical instruments. The museum of Kunst und Gewerbe exhibits a thousand years worth of arts and crafts, while the Museum of Ethnology boasts an impressive collection of ethnic items from faraway places. If you want to learn more about Hamburg, then be sure to visit the Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte (Museum of Local History), which contains a model of \"Hammaburg,\" the medieval settlement from which Hamburg gets its name. If the weather is good, then it may be worth taking a trip along the river to the Museumshafen (Boat Museum) at Övelgönne, the final resting place of many an ancient vessel.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hamburg has a good selection of cinemas for the cinephile. The gigantic CinemaxX at Dammtor is the most centrally located, but if you prefer to avoid the rush that normally accompanies the latest Hollywood blockbuster, then head for the Zeise Kinos, located in an old factory in Altona. Other well-known cinemas include Holi while the Abaton shows director\''s cuts and art films.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When it comes to nightlife, the first place most people think of is the Reeperbahn. If you want to have fun, then there\''s no avoiding the district of St. Pauli, where you\''ll find the best nightclubs such as Mojo Club, Molotow, Panoptikum, Disco im Docks, Große Freiheit und Kaiserkeller, as well as plenty of theaters, like St. Pauli-Theater and Schmidts Tivoli, museums like the Sankt Pauli Museum and Panoptikum, and of course, Germany\''s most famous red light strip!For an alternative vibe, the Sternschanze, a short distance from St. Pauli is a trendy neighborhood peppered with hip bars and interesting venues like Rote Flora. Those in search of a more upscale experience, can head to bars like the Le Lion de Paris or Christiansen\''s in the Old Town which add a touch of extravagance to the evening while those like the Absinth Bar cater to more niche palates.If you\''ve spent a night on the town and need a hearty breakfast to sober you up, then there\''s no better place than the fish market.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hamburg offers limitless sporting entertainment for both active sports people as well as spectators. Hamburg\''s main football team is HSV Hamburg, who play in Germany\''s premier division - the Bundesliga. Their home is the wonderful Volksparkstadion, which hosted some games of the 2006 World Cup. The city\''s other major soccer team, FC St. Pauli, play in the atmospheric Millerntor-Stadion and are currently in the second division. HSV share the Volksparkstadion with Hamburg Blue Devils, an American football team that has become increasingly popular over the past decade.  The Hamburg marathon, Haspa, attracts over a million spectators who turn out every year to cheer the runners along the 42-kilometer (26-mile) long course. If you\''d like to take part but need to get fit first, then Hamburg\''s parks - Volkspark Altona and Stadtpark - and the leafy area around Lake Alster are great jogging territory. Many young people now prefer to rollerblade or cycle through the parks, in an effort to someday match German cycling legend Jan Ullrich\''s record.If you\''re more interested in watersports, then Hamburg, with its numerous lakes and canals, offers splendid conditions for rowers, sailors, water skiers and canoeists. Horse racing fans can also get their money\''s worth at the Trabrennbahn Bahrenfeld and Hamburger Derby-Woche in Hamburg Horn. Swimmers should visit Alster-Schwimmhalle, while tennis fans can watch the stars volley the ball around the court in the Rothenbaum Championships, which take place every spring.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (887,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The City Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city center, which lies between Außenalster Lake and the Elbe, sets the pace for the rest of the city commercially, politically and socially. Its magnificent boulevards are lined with shops; you would never guess that most of the area lay devastated at the end of World War II. Those in search of culture need look no further: the Hamburger Kunsthalle und Galerie der Gegenwart, Hamburgische Staatsoper & Ballettcompagnie John Neumeier, the Thalia Theater and the Deutsches Schauspielhaus Hamburg are located here, as too are the Stock Exchange and the extravagant Town Hall.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Altstadt</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Altstadt, or Old Town, contains many of the city\''s most historic buildings, including the 9th-century Hammaburg, and Hamburg\''s major churches: St. Michaelis, St. Katharinen, St. Jacobi, St. Petri Kirche and the ruins of Nikolaikirche.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kontorhaus Quarter</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The historic Laeiszhof und Globushof (commercial buildings) that lie between Steinstraße and Meßberg are architectural rarities. Indeed, the Kontorhaus Quarter is a different world; the narrow streets around Burchhard-Platz are lined with enormous red-brick buildings such as Chilehaus and Sprinkenhof. Despite their size, these buildings are not over-imposing, but instead, are proud, solid and dignified. They stand in ordered rows and give this district its distinctive feel.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pöseldorf/Harvestude</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The upmarket Pöseldorf/Harvestude district lies on the Outer Alster\''s western shore. Dominated by rows of late-19th-century townhouses and ornate, neo-classical mansions, this area is a favorite of young professionals. Everything is extremely trendy, which has led to the district being christened \"Schnöseldorf,\" or \"Little Snot\''s Town,\" by locals. Harvestuder Weg, home to many foreign consulates and company headquarters, is one of the city\''s most sought-after addresses, while Alsteruferweg is perfect for a relaxing stroll.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Universitätsviertel</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The University Quarter lies to the west of Rothenbaumchaussee. As you may expect, this is an exciting part of town with plenty going on. Most of the people who hang out in the neighborhood\''s bars, cafés and clubs are either students or media types. Hamburg University\''s main building is located on Edmund-Siemers-Allee, and if you venture westward from there, you\''ll find yourself at the Grindel-Hochhäuser (Grindel Tower Blocks), built between 1924 to 1928.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Eppendorf</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Eppendorf is another popular residential area. The streets are lined with elegant turn-of-the-century townhouses, and many small rivers flow through the district. Be sure to visit the Isemarkt, located under the viaduct on Isestraße. Eppendorf\''s market square contains a memorial to writer Wolfgang Borchert. Inscribed with the words of his poem <em>Say No!</em>, the memorial reflects his deeply-held anti-war beliefs.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Altona</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This former autonomous Danish city was annexed by the Nazis in 1937. The most heavily-populated part of Hamburg, it is a multicultural working-class neighborhood. Architecture buffs will love the \"Kontorhäuser,\" the renovated factories, the imposing classical Palmaille and the exquisite villas on Elbchaussee. The Altonaer Rathaus is built in the typical style of the Wilhelminian era (1888 - 1918).</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Blankenese</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lined with ancient trees and ornate villas, the 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) long Elbchaussee has been described as the \"most beautiful street in the world\" and leads the way from Altona to the exclusive district of Blankenese. Famous for its white fishing huts, historic country residences, parks, gardens, views of the River Elbe, its winding paths and narrow stairways, this is a favorite haunt for locals and visitors alike.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Schanzenviertel/Karolinenviertel</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once home to a thriving student population and a varied immigrant community, this area is transforming into a hip hangout. These two districts are extremely multicultural and are great for people-watching. Their numerous watering holes, tea rooms and ethnic shops make them a perfect place to visit night or day. Yet the fact that they have been \"discovered\" means that their original character is struggling to survive.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">St. Pauli</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hamburg\''s notorious red-light district is the liveliest and most vibrant part of town, and the 30,000 people who live here are an eclectic mix of young and old. The legendary Reeperbahn runs the length of the district and is lined with clubs, fast food joints, and bars as far as the eye can see. If you explore the side streets, you may be in for a surprise! Located at the eastern end of the Reeperbahn is the Heiligengeistfeld known for its Millerntor-Stadion. St. Pauli stretches from the Planten un Blomen (Wallanlagen) to Hafenstraße and the Landungsbrücken.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Harbor</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Harbor is the heart of the city. Visit it and you will soon find out why Hamburg is known as the \"gateway to the world.\" It is one of the world\''s largest harbors and its 75 square kilometers (29 square miles) make up over one-tenth of the city\''s entire area. Especially worth seeing are the Köhlbrandtbrücke, the Landungsbrücken, Alter Elbtunnel and the Speicherstadt. Whatever you choose to do in Hamburg, even if it\''s simply taking a walk in one of the city\''s many parks and gardens (Hamburg is Germany\''s greenest city), you are guaranteed to enjoy yourself!</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

As a self-governing British colony, Bermuda is comprised of 181 small islands and islets connected by bridges and causeways that resemble a fishhook from the air. Bermuda is divided into nine parishes or \"tribes,\" as they were called back in the 1600s when the island was first surveyed. The original eight tribes, named after prominent shareholders in the Bermuda Company, included Sandys, Southampton, Warwick, Paget, Pembroke, Devonshire, Smith\''s and Hamilton, and were divided by narrow lanes. While some tribe roads are remnants of the past, others exist today as shortcuts to major roads and footpaths. St. George\''s, considered public land back in those days, is the island\''s ninth parish. Each parish is unique. St. George\''s captures the island\''s past with structures dating back to the 17th Century. Pastel-colored buildings make up the government and shopping destinations in the city of Hamilton and Pembroke Parish.

Pubs across the island have long been a mainstay of the local entertainment scene and are a great place for visitors to mingle with the natives.

Founded in 1612 when the <em>Sea Venture</em> was shipwrecked off the coast, the Town has experienced little change over the 400 years since and illustrates what life was like in past centuries. In November 2000, the town of St. George was named a World Heritage Site. Also found in the Parish is Fort St. Catherine; it is Bermuda\''s most impressive fortification and dates back to 1613. Tucker\''s Town, in southern St. George\''s, is home to the most expensive luxury homes in Bermuda. St. George\''s also houses L.F. Wade International Airport.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pembroke</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parish</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Centrally located, Pembroke houses capital city of Bermuda, Hamilton, which replaced the Town of St. George as capital in 1815. Known for its shopping destinations, international business, and culture, Hamilton is also home to the island\''s governmental and parliamentary agencies. Front Street, lined with rows of distinctive, pastel-tone buildings, houses the main ferry terminal, department stores, banks and restaurants, and is where parades and other local happenings are hosted. During high season, from April through October, cruise ships can be seen docked in Hamilton Harbour, along the street. Outside of the capital to the northeast is Fort Hamilton, which was originally designed to overcome enemy attacks and is now home to a garden moat lined with flora. Spanish Point is a scenic parkland and residential area that is off the beaten path, while Admiralty House Park offers a scenic beach with magnificent ocean views, hiking trails and a gardens.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sandys Parish</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The westernmost of all Bermuda\''s parishes, Sandys is the furthest away from the island\''s airport. While an expensive taxi ride, the parish is served by four ferry stops, as well as the island\''s buses. Attractions on the West End tend to be natural such as Mangrove Bay, Ely\''s Harbor and Springfield, and Gilbert Nature Reserve; however, the big draw is the Royal Naval Dockyard, a British naval shipyard abandoned in the 1950s, and the Maritime Museum. Somerset Village houses the world\''s smallest drawbridge - the 81-centimeter (32-inch) Somerset Bridge barely provides enough room for a sailboat\''s mast.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hamilton Parish</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">East of St. George\''s, Hamilton runs from the North Shore to the South Shore and is best explored by moped, bicycle or taxi. The area has deep limestone caves, including Crystal Caves, and Cathedral and Prospero\''s Caves. Hamilton Parish surrounds Harrington Sound and is also home to the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum & Zoo, the Holy Trinity Church, the Bermuda Perfumery & Gardens, and several parks and nature reserves.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Smith\''s</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parish</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Smith\''s sits between Hamilton and Devonshire, running from the North Shore to the South Shore and overlooking part of Harrington Sound. The island\''s three main roads—North Shore Road, Middle Road and South Shore Road - pass through Smith\''s, each offering scenic views from narrow and winding bends. Smith\''s includes Spittal Pond—Bermuda\''s largest bird sanctuary stretching nearly 25 hectares (60 acres) and the popular beach, John Smith\''s Bay. In addition, Verdmont Historic Manor House, built in 1716, exemplifies early Georgian architecture and houses a collection of Bermuda cedar furniture and valuable mahogany.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Devonshire Parish</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Devonshire runs from the North Shore to the South Shore - set between Smith\''s to its east, Pembroke to its northwest and Paget to its southwest. At one time, the parish housed the British Army headquarters with the majority of the land used for military purposes. Today, the only remnants of base are a former hospital, now a government ministry headquarters, a graveyard, and the Officers Mess. Nature can be seen throughout the parish at the 9-hectare (22-acre) Arboretum, full of tall trees, open meadows and palms, and the Edmund Gibbons Nature Reserve - a small walking area with local flora, fauna and migratory birds. Palm Grove is an estate with gardens, a tropical bird aviary, moongate and an island map set in a pond.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Paget</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parish</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To Devonshire\''s west is Paget, extending from Hamilton Harbour on the North to the South Shore. Best for exploring, the Parish is home to the Bermuda National Trust headquarters at Waterville and other historic houses. The parish features the 15-hectare (36-acre) Bermuda Botanical Gardens, which exhibits flora that thrives in the island\''s sub-tropical climate, as well as Camden House, the official residence of Bermuda\''s Premier. Also of note is Paget Marsh, Bermuda\''s second largest nature reserve that features palmetto and cedar trees, as well as a mangrove swamp.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Warwick</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parish</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Set between Southampton and Paget, Warwick spans from the Great Sound to the South Shore. The parish is the most densely populated of all parishes and is famous for its South Shore beaches. South Shore Park extends from Chaplin\''s Bay, a scenic public beach, east passing over Stonehole Bay and Jobson\''s Cove. The stretch ends at Warwick Long Bay, Bermuda\''s longest length of unparalleled beach.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Southampton Parish</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Southampton is the second-most western parish sitting between Sandys and Warwick, overlooking the Great Sound. Due to the long distance, getting to the parish from the airport is an expensive taxi ride.  Gibbs Hill Lighthouse and park, just under 4 hectares (10 acres), is a prominent Bermuda landmark and one of the oldest iron lighthouses in the world. Horseshoe Bay stretches for a quarter of a mile and is shaped like a horseshoe of pink sand beach fringed by limestone cliffs.

 (915,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums & Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hartford has several unique museums and historical sights that cater to history buffs, the literary-inclined and art enthusiasts. Hartford\''s Wadsworth Atheneum houses one of the finest small collections of European and American art in the country along with special touring exhibits. The Harriet Beecher Stowe and Mark Twain residences in the Asylum Hill area are not just for schoolchildren, but lovers of American literature, dedicated to two of the country\''s most prolific and influential writers. For local history, visit the Museum of Connecticut History, and check out the Connecticut Science Center and the Children\''s Museum with your kids.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater & Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Connecticut River Valley is full of unique theaters, their program ranging from local productions to national tours of big Broadway shows thanks to its proximity to New York City. The Bushnell Theater in downtown Hartford is the city\''s premier theater venue with a stellar line-up of Broadway hits as well as concerts by leading musicians. Also in Hartford is the XL Center which is not just a sports arena, but also a venue for major concerts featuring the likes of Coldplay, Tina Turner and Neil Diamond. During the summer months, nothing beats an outdoor concert at the Xfinity Theatre where the annual Dave Matthews concert draws crowds for two days of musical interlude.If you are interested in taking a scenic drive down Route 9 towards Long Island Sound, the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam puts on three productions a year of new and lesser-known (yet astounding) American musicals. The Goodspeed is birthplace to two great shows, <em>The Man of La Mancha</em> and <em>Annie</em>, both of which made the successful route up to Broadway and Hollywood.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Whalers\'' NHL franchise might be gone, but there is no dearth of sporting events in Hartford. The XL Center has been home to the AHL team, the Hartford Wolf Pack, since 1997. Also held at the XL Center each year are numerous games of the men\''s and women\''s University of Connecticut (UConn) basketball teams, while others are held at the Gampel Pavilion on the main UConn campus over in Storrs.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are several public spaces for a pleasant stroll in Downtown, like Bushnell Park with its historic carousel, and Pope Park with its ample walking and cycling trails. Another great spot for a stroll is over at Trinity College where the campus is closed to major traffic and you can explore the school\''s famous quads on foot. One of Hartford\''s most popular in-city retreats is Riverside Park, composed of four parks on both sides of the Connecticut River.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (916,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown Hartford contains some of the city\''s oldest buildings, such as the Federal-style Old State House (1796) designed by Thomas Bulfinch, architect of some of New England\''s other great state houses. The Center Church & Ancient Burial Ground right in the heart of the downtown area were part of the original congregations of the city, founded in the early 17th Century. Intermingled amongst the quaint 18th-and 19th-century architecture, lie the ultra-modern skyscrapers of today, housing the headquarters of the nation\''s largest insurance companies. Downtown also hosts a variety of cultural venues, such as the Wadsworth Atheneum with its impressive collection of European art, the Hartford Stage, and The Bushnell - a theater that hosts first-run and national tours of Broadway\''s biggest show, providing entertainment for tourists and locals alike. If you prefer to spend some time in the outdoors, Bushnell Park offers a comfortable escape from the manic pace of downtown Hartford and a vintage carousel to please children of all ages. Close to Interstate 91, the scenic Riverfront Park, overlooks the majestic Connecticut River.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parkville</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Parkville is home to the Hartford\''s Portuguese-speaking community with plenty of streets lined with Portuguese and Brazilian shops, restaurants and the Our Lady of Sorrows, a Catholic church still celebrates Mass in Latin.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Frog Hollow</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Named for its marshy land, Frog Hollow was originally home to a large African-American community prior to the Civil War. After the war, in the midst of America\''s Industrial Age, numerous immigrants came to the Hartford to work at one of the many factories that lined the Connecticut River throughout the 19th Century and the early 20th Century. Today, it is home to the city\''s Latino and Caribbean communities, with the main drag of Park Street often referred to as \"New England\''s Spanish Main Street.\" Frog Hollow is also home to one of the country\''s premier liberal arts schools, Trinity College, with noted alumni such as playwright Edward Albee and political pundit Tucker Carlson. Pope Park, one of the city\''s original recreational areas, was created in 1898 by the Olmsted Brothers Landscape Architects, an architectural landscaping firm known for their work on several National Parks, college campuses and in city parks.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Asylum Hill & West End</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The peculiar name of Asylum Hill comes from the School that was founded here in 1807 - the Asylum for the Education and Instruction of Deaf and Dumb Persons, the first of its kind in the United States. In commemoration of this area\''s history, a statue of Alice Cogwell, the school\''s first student was placed at the intersection of Farmington and Asylum Avenues. Over the years, Asylum Hill has been home to Hartford\''s notable society, including writers such as Harriet Beecher Stowe and Mark Twain, their residences now the site of museums that detail their lives and work. Along with its famed residents is the neighborhood\''s unique architecture, epitomized by the Trinity Episcopal Church and Cathedral of St. Joseph.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sheldon-Charter Oak & South Green</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The original site of the city\''s Dutch settlement along the Connecticut River, Sheldon-Charter Oak is immediately recognizable to those arriving via I-95 into Hartford by the Colt Firearms Factory\''s blue onion dome. The 50 German-style houses constructed along the riverway were originally intended for the employees of the factory, a section known as Potsdam Village; however, only ten of these residences still remain. At the intersection of Charter Oak Avenue stands a monument to the Charter Oak, the oak tree that once hid the Connecticut Colony charter during the late-17th Century.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Northeast</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The neighborhood known as the Northeast is located in the upper corner of the city and was home to many Jewish and Irish immigrants who worked in nearby factories, such as the Fuller Brush Company and the Bishop Ladder Company. On July 6, 1944, during an afternoon performance of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, the circus tent caught fire (it was coated with paraffin and gasoline, a common waterproofing solution at the time) and approximately 165 people lost their lives in the scramble to escape the blaze. As a result of the fire, circuses were banned throughout Connecticut until the 1970s. Today, a memorial stands to those who died as a result of the fire.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Meadows</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In nearby North Meadows is one of Connecticut\''s great music venues - the Xfinity Theatre, formerly and most commonly referred to as The Meadows. Plenty of pleasant excursions can be had at the Riverside Park where there is ample open space for frisbee, boating or even cricket.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South End</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just as nearby New Haven has Wooster Street, Hartford has its Little Italy in the South End. Like several urban centers of the Northeast, the majority of the population of this neighborhood was Italian-American until the past couple of decades. Nonetheless, its past can easily be seen in the high number of Italian-owned businesses that still line Franklin Avenue (Little Italy). These walkable streets are full of bakeries and shops that appeal to locals and visitors alike.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Quiet Corner (Northeastern Connecticut)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The northeastern corner of the state is lovingly referred to as \"The Quiet Corner\" since it is one of the least densely populated areas of the Boston-Washington, D.C. Corridor. This part of the state is filled with popular local shops, farms and vineyards that attract a healthy number of tourists throughout the year, such as the Mansfield Drive-In Theatre & Marketplace and the Taylor Brooke Winery. During the academic year; however, the population of this quiet region comes to life as students make their way to the University of Connecticut (UConn). Of course, many also come to campus to see the Huskies\'' men\''s and women\''s basketball teams take on other Big East and top nationally-ranked teams.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Litchfield</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the opposite corner of the state is Litchfield and Litchfield County. The area is most popular with weekenders and honeymooners with its plethora of romantic bed and breakfasts, country inns, unique restaurants and day spas. If you are looking for a quiet retreat, not far from New York or Hartford, Litchfield is where you can really get a taste of New England.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Connecticut River Valley</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nestled along the 407-mile (655-kilometer) long Connecticut River, the Connecticut River Valley contains some of the state\''s oldest and historic towns. Old Saybrook, located at the mouth of the River, was first called the Saybrook Colony (settled in 1635) and was the original site of Yale University from 1701 until it moved to New Haven in 1716. Just up the river is Essex, attacked by the British during the War of 1812, which draws visitors today with the lovely Griswold Inn and Essex Steam Train & Riverboat. Halfway between Old Saybrook and Hartford is Middletown, seat of Middlesex County and home to Wesleyan University.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (926,'<div class=\"OverviewText\">Finland\''s capital city, founded on June 12, 1550, is a multi-faceted town that is unique in many ways and has much to offer any visitor. Helsinki is set apart from other big historical cities by two factors: the great physical presence of nature and the very clear grid pattern used to design the city\''s streets. Most big cities have a limited number of parks. In Helsinki, parks can be found behind almost every corner. Even in the most densely-built districts of the city center, significant parks liven up the landscape. Both the overwhelming presence of nature and the network of straight, symmetrical and wide streets, which make finding any address a simple task, are the creation of the city\''s two main designers, Johan Albrecht Ehrenström and Carl Ludvig Engel.Helsinki is formally divided into a total of 54 districts, but more commonly the city is merely divided into the center and the suburbs. The southern districts are older (some would say more revered), and they contain most of the city\''s main tourist attractions.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (933,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Helsinki has countless museums and should be able to satisfy both the most particular and the most demanding art lover. For a look at contemporary art, Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art will be an interesting place to start. Then again, if you have your sights set on something less <em>avant-garde</em>, more in the line of fine art, The Museum of Finnish Art, Ateneum might be a better place to start, with its collection of works by artists ranging from Auguste Rodin to Akseli Gallen-Kallela and more. There is a multitude of galleries in Helsinki, especially in the Uudenmaankatu area. In Kamppi, the Galerie Anhava, a longstanding art institution features premier exhibits, and is also a regular participant in global art fairs. Others like the Galerie Forsblom acquaint you with evocative Finnish art, while the Helsinki Contemporary reserves its gallery space for talented emerging artists.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Helsinki surprisingly hosts a wide plethora of film options that span mainstream and commercial cinema, to indie film treasures. The recreational behemoth Tennispalatsi has 14 screens, including Finland\''s largest screen, with a surface area of 176 square meters. Kinopalatsi, which has ten screens, is the second biggest cinema complex in Helsinki. Besides these, there are of course many other smaller theaters and in most of them you will be able to see the most recent film releases. For the movie-goer with a more refined taste there is Orion, run by the Finnish Film Archives, with older films and a continuously changing program of themes, ranging from Fritz Lang movies to Czechoslovakian animations.In case you are looking for the slightly off-beat, but nonetheless want to see something more recent than what Orion has to offer, then Andorra might be the place to look. Most films are shown in their original languages and have subtitles in Finnish and/or Swedish. Some children\''s movies may be dubbed into Finnish.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater & Dance</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When it comes to dance, Helsinki is surprisingly amply equipped, having everything from the renowned Helsinki City Theater Dance Group to diverse Zodiak—productions at the Kaapelitehdas (\"Cable Factory\"). Not to mention the numerous independent dance productions which are put on continuously all over the city. Then there is of course the National Opera, where you can find anything from opera to ballet or more contemporary dance, and the Helsinki City Theatre that hosts dance programs from time to time.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For classical music, Sibelius Academy (one of the world\''s most famous music academies) organizes a large number of concerts in various places over the year. Jazz-lovers, on the other hand, will probably find what they are looking for in Storyville, and if rock music is your thing, the best places to look for it might well be Tavastia or Semifinal. The Nosturi, a famed music hall in the city, is the hub for Helsinki\''s most happening music festivals, and also hosts a variety of live music concerts featuring eclectic genres. Bar Loose, located in the center of the city, enjoys a thriving art scene.  This, of course, is not to say that the above-mentioned are the only places to look! In addition to these, all kinds of music, from classical to rock, can occasionally be found in surprising places ranging from still-functioning churches to small cafés, and often performed outdoors.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Clubs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Something to consider about the nightlife in Helsinki is the drinking age, which is not always clear. At the age of 24 you are guaranteed admission to all places. Below that, there are no guarantees. Many clubs and pubs demand proof that you are 20, others permit those above the age of 18. Home to a pulsating nightlife, most bars in the city stay open until 2a, while clubs are merrily open well until 4a. A trendy club for young adults is the Le Bonk. Ääniwalli doubles up as both a party club and a live music venue, bringing together the best of both worlds for those who can\''t choose between the two, while Kaiku is a wildly popular underground venue that hosts both local and international DJs each weekend. The DTM nightclub is a hot favorite with the city\''s LGBTQ community.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Sites</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Suomenlinna fortress island with its many attractions like the Doll and Toy Museum, the Vesikko Submarine, and the Summer Theatre, is a fascinating place to visit. It is lovely to spend a whole day there, picnicking and sunbathing as well as sightseeing. Getting there can be especially rewarding in the summer, when you can browse through the many stalls of the Market Square or take a look at the offerings in the cooler Old Market Hall (Vanha Kauppahalli), while waiting for the ferry to Suomenlinna. Among many other sights worth seeing and not yet mentioned are the Seurasaari Open-Air Museum in an environment that is sure to appeal to the nature-lover, and the Heureka Science Centre, for the more scientifically-minded. Also of interest is the Kiseleff House, which is perfect for souvenir and gift shopping. The entrance to the Kiseleff House is on Aleksanterinkatu, on the edge of the Senate Square.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Amusement</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For those so inclined ,there is also an amusement park in Helsinki called Linnanmäki, literally meaning \"Castle Hill,\" the park indeed being situated upon a hill. Here you will find bumper cars, slot machines, a roller coaster ride (the quite unique 100 year-old Vuoristorata), and open-air shows. Also worth a visit is the large Serena water park, not too far from the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Imagine being in this design-oriented city and not buying a single item that is elemental to Finland. Avoid this blunder by heading straight to the Design District in the city, where talented Finnish designers display their unusual wares. Go big and dive head first into the beauty of Finnish design by stopping by at decor and furniture stores like Artek, Iittala\''s (famous for their glassware), and Marimekko. Even if you don\''t end up buying anything, a walk through this stunning store is a lesson in aesthetics. For great bargains, the Kaivarin Kanuuna is vintage central, and although it recognizes itself as a \''flea market\'', it is really an enclosed shop that sells beautiful second-hand and gently-used items including books, accessories and home decor items. If you like your options and want to avoid shop-hopping, find everything under one roof at the Galleria Esplanad or the Kamppi Center malls.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

It centers around Engel Square, which is surrounded by beautiful buildings, including the Chinese Embassy. Ullanlinna, with its marine panorama and densely-built historical buildings is popular among stylish young adults, interior designers and architects. Kaivopuisto\''s lovely park features large, elegant houses and embassies and is popular among bankers and diplomats.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Punavuori & Kallio</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Punavuori and the slightly more northern district of Kallio were traditionally working men\''s districts, though Punavuori has tried to improve its image in recent years. Punavuori is full of old buildings and popular among young graduates and a large international populace. Kallio is known for its waterways, Hakaniemi Square and the fabulous Kallio church. The district is mostly populated by young, educated adults and low-income families.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Töölö & Meilahti</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The respectable district of Töölö is full of old apartment buildings, which are beautiful, densely packed and highly sought-after. Töölö also has many spectacular sights, including the Hietaniemi Cemetery, Sibelius Monument, Parliament Building, Olympic Stadium and the gorgeous parklands around Töölö Bay. Behind Töölö lies Meilahti, known for its old villas. Meilahti is a spacious district populated by the middle-class.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Katajanokka & Kruununhaka</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Slightly cut off from the rest of the city, Katajanokka was known in the past for its ports and prison. Nowadays this architecturally significant, <em>Jugend</em>-style district is part of many sightseeing tours, and is populated by artists and journalists. It is also a political center. North of Katajanokka lies the peaceful and highly respected district of Kruununhaka, the neighbor of the historical center designed by Engel. At the heart of this central and historic district lies the venerated Senate Square, where a beautiful jumble of neoclassical buildings vie for attention. Some of the most monumental landmarks located here include the Helsinki Cathedral, the Government Palace, the University of Helsinki and Sederholm House.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kamppi & Kluuvi</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A densely-populated district that stretches from the Central Railway Station to the Cable Factory, Kamppi features the city\''s most important services and excellent transport connections, but also a number of sights. For example, here you\''ll come across the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art and the Ruoholahti villas, historically significant wooden buildings that are some of the oldest in the city. Right between Kamppi and Kaartinkaupunki lies Kluuvi, the busiest district in Helsinki. Kluuvi is a great place to shop or eat out.

 (953,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In a style that critics describe as \"the sound of cats mating to music,\" the proud tradition of Cantonese Opera is alive and well in Hong Kong. Actually, learning a little about this art form beforehand, and getting a synopsis of the plot, can make watching Cantonese Opera more enjoyable. The costumes and stylized gestures, along with the often acrobatic dancing and high-pitched singing, make for a unique entertainment experience.  There are several varieties of Chinese Opera, among them Cantonese Opera is known to have the most outstanding physical choreography. The form is now taught in a special program at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, and performances can be seen at many venues around town. Civic theaters such as the Shatin Town Hall and the North District Town Hall are happy to inform visitors about upcoming shows. In addition, there is often a major opera company performing at the annual Hong Kong Arts Festival in February and March, plus regular performances at the Cultural Centre. Canto Pop is the term used to describe Hong Kong\''s particular brand of pop music - think Celine Dion meets Karaoke. Sugary and upbeat, it is definitely an acquired taste! However, if a good, clean melodic puppy-love tune is the order of the day, then Canto Pop is the answer. The best way to hear Canto Pop is to ride the local buses, on which loudspeakers pipe in local radio broadcasts. For anyone hankering after a live performance, there are the occasional concerts at the Hong Kong Coliseum or the Queen Elizabeth Stadium by huge stars like Faye Wong, Andy Lau or Leon Lai. International artists regularly grace the city\''s major stadiums during sold-out world tours while indie artists find a home in iconic niche venues like Hidden Agenda, Orange Peel, and The Wanch.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dance</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most of the city\''s arts festivals feature dance as a major component. Whether it is ballet, modern dance or the traditional Chinese Lion Dance, there is usually lots of movement to be found at venues such as the Hong Kong Arts Centre, Shatin Town Hall, Kwai Tsing Theatre, and the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts.  The Hong Kong Ballet performs strong renditions of classical ballets, while the City Contemporary Dance Company creates modern, innovative pieces. The colorful \"Lion Dance\" is usually performed at the opening of new businesses, at weddings or at other events where the organizers want to ward off evil spirits. Chinese New Year is a great time to see a lion dance on the street or near a temple.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theatre</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Aside from the many major international touring productions that stop off in Hong Kong, there is a lot going on in the local theater scene, both in Cantonese and English. The Fringe Club is the hub of theater activity in town. It also puts on the annual City Festival, a multi-disciplinary festival that features a blend of up-and-coming theater artists with more well-known performers. In addition, the Kwai Tsing Theatre lines up a challenging season of new commissioned works as well as classics. For an evening of cabaret or comedy, look into TakeOut Comedy Club.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Movies</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most people think Hong Kong cinema is all about martial arts. For the most part, they are right. Heroes such as Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan have spawned a whole slew of martial arts films with overblown tragic plots and fast action. There is variety, though, and if you look hard enough, you might find a Hong Kong film with a storyline that goes beyond tough action. Aside from seeing the latest films, sitting in a big, comfy, air-conditioned theater, can also be a great way to escape the heat of summer.As well as all the usual cinematic offerings, there is a strong independent film scene, mainly featured at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, while arthouse and foreign films can be found at venues such as the Goethe-Institut (mainly German-language films) and the Broadway Cinemateque.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums & Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the scientific rigors of the Space Museum to the modern art installations in the galleries at the Fringe Club, from the informative and unique Law Uk Folk Museum to the bizarre (and definitely worth a visit) Police Museum, there is no shortage of cultural venues in Hong Kong. Of course, there is also the Hong Kong Cultural Centre, and the fantastic Marine Land at Ocean Park, and a quick stroll through Central will reveal many intriguing little antique stores and galleries, so take your pick!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Horse Races</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To experience the complete insanity of a crowd in Hong Kong, a visit to one of the city\''s horse-racing tracks - the Happy Valley Racecourse or the Shatin Racecourse - is a must. Intense gambling and socializing mixed with the excitement of first-rate horse racing promise some edge-of-the-seat thrills.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whether you are making purchases for yourself or someone special back home, Hong Kong\''s shopping is notorious for its selection of style, availability and price range. If Hong Kong is the closest you will make it to China, check out the traditional handicrafts and fine jewelry available at the Jade Market and the historic Western Market. If style and fashion is what you seek, join the crowds along Fa Yuen Street or Granville Road to window shop and bargain in some of Hong Kong\''s best boutiques. For a mix of shopping, eating and people watching, an evening spent at Temple Street Night Market is not easily forgotten.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Recreation and Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hong Kong\''s warm climate and surrounding waters make water sports and beach activities a major pull. The Stanley Beach Water Sports Complex is ideal for a day of fun near the beaches while hiking a portion of the Lantau Trail offers excellent views of the city and a chance to escape into the greener side of Hong Kong. Trips to the gorgeous Lamma Island invite visitors to explore the Kamikaze Caves, quaint fishing villages, and emerald coves ideal for swimming. For spectator sports, the massive Hong Kong Stadium hosts international and national-level sporting events through the year.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Family Fun</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hong Kong has a fantastic array of activities for all ages, including kids. The Hong Kong Disneyland on Lantau brings all the Disney favorites to life along with fun rides and themed parks like Adventureland and Toy Story Land. Another long standing favorite for visitors is Ocean Park while The Peak offers several great attractions too like Madame Tussauds. The city also has plenty of parks, zoos and aquariums like the Hong Kong Park and Zoological and Botanical Gardens and the S.E.A. Aquarium where you can spend a fun day with the kids.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hong Kong\''s nightlife is notorious for lasting through the small hours of the morning. Live music and guest DJs are a draw at Dragon-I while the people watching from the terrace of Wagyu is an entertainment unto itself. A well poured drink is no small feat. The folks at Blue Bar understand how to do it right and are sure to please. The neighborhoods of Lan Kwai Fong and SoHo are known for their concentration of bars, clubs and party venues from the trendy to the low-key while across from Victoria Harbor, the rooftop bars offer spectacular neon-lit views of the city. For some of the best dance tracks in town, Volar is a favorite with both locals and visitors to the city.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (954,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hong Kong Island</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Victoria Peak is the highest point on the island with world-famous views north over the city as well as over the greener southern slopes down to the South China Sea. Clinging onto the northern slopes of the peak are the prestigious Mid-levels, full of tightly packed, towering blocks of flats. The Mid-levels\'' steep slopes are best negotiated using the Peak Tram or the Mid-levels Escalator.  Colonial history and modern architecture vie for attention in Central, the city\''s vibrant financial hub. At the end of the business day, offices empty as the multitude of international eateries and bars in Lan Kwai Fong and Soho fill with revelers. Almost an extension of Central, Admiralty plays host to the glitzy Pacific Place shopping and hotel complex. For a little rest, Hong Kong Park is a must.  The old districts of Western and Sheung Wan, with Des Voeux Road West and Western Market in their midst, portray a more traditional scene with shops selling anything and everything Chinese.  Wanchai is busy, even after the demise of Suzie Wong. The restaurant and club scene centers around Lockhart Road. The Hong Kong Academy for the Performing Arts caters to more cerebral entertainment while the Hong Kong Convention & Exhibition Centre, the site of the 1997 handover ceremony of Hong Kong to the People\''s Republic of China, sees more trade fairs and rock concerts.  Happy Valley is home to the Happy Valley Racecourse, with the Queen Elizabeth Stadium nearby. Just across Leighton Hill there is the Hong Kong Stadium, venue of the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens and other sporting events. Causeway Bay is where Hong Kongers go to shop. Beyond the shopping malls there is Victoria Park, the Tin Hau Temple, and the daily boom of the Noon Day Gun. Further along the coast is the Eastern District. Although largely residential, it holds a few surprises.  The south side of Hong Kong Island is a complete contrast to the concrete jungle of the northern shores. Country parks, fishing villages, markets and beaches offer an altogether more relaxed atmosphere. Hong Kong\''s colonial past can be explored at Murray House in Stanley, while the city\''s sleepy harbor comes alive in a flurry of activity during the annual Dragon Boat Racing festival held here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kowloon</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kowloon is flanked to the north by verdant hills forming nine peaks, hence its name, which literally means \"nine dragons\". At the very tip of the Kowloon peninsula lies Tsim Sha Tsui, a tourist magnet with Nathan Road as its focal point. Running between the Clock Tower and Tsim Sha Tsui East is the Waterfront Promenade, with views of Victoria Harbor and Hong Kong Island that are every photographer\''s dream.  Yaumatei\''s rural heritage is still evident in its name, which means \"place of sesame plants.\" Although sesame plants are scarce here these days, Yaumatei, with its old Tin Hau Temple and Jade Market, is still steeped in tradition. Famous for being one of the world\''s most densely populated urban areas, Mongkok is also the place for markets of all sorts. The streets are packed with locals and tourists alike, buying everything from clothes and computer goods to flowers and birds.  Beyond these districts Kowloon becomes more residential. Noteworthy are the Kowloon Walled City, the Festival Walk mega-shopping complex, the similarly mega Wong Tai Sin Temple and the fishing village at Lei Yue Mun.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">New Territories</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although the New Territories actually account for almost three-fourths of the Hong Kong SAR region, only about a third of the population lives here, mainly in high-rise new-towns.  Once a small village famous for incense cultivation, Shatin is now a prime example of such a new-town. Aside from rather dull architecture, Shatin is home to the Shatin Racecourse. The Tsang Tai Uk walled village, Che Kung Temple and Man Fat Monastery also ensure that Shatin is far from becoming a cultural desert. Lion Rock provides panoramic views over both Shatin and Kowloon, while Amah Rock is a popular picnicking spot. Tai Po still has a thriving market area with the much-loved Man Mo Temple in its midst. Not far away in Lam Tsuen is the Wishing Tree, its branches heavy with wishes written on colorful paper. Fanling is where the last governor of Hong Kong had his country residence and also where the last tiger of Hong Kong was sighted in the 1950s. There is also the Fung Ying Sin Koon. Also in the area are the ancestral halls of Tang Chung Ling and Liu Man Shek Tong, as well as the Lok Ma Chau Lookout Point with its views across into mainland China.  Yuen Long is close to the Tai Fu Tai Mansion, the walled villages of Kat Hing Wai and Shui Tau, and the Mai Po Marshes. At the foot of Tai Mo Shan lies Tsuen Wan, the springboard to the western New Territories.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outlying Islands</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">More than 200 outlying islands belong to the Hong Kong SAR, but only a small number are inhabited. Amongst the forested hills and hiking trails of Lantau, the territory\''s biggest island, there is the Big Buddha and the Po Lin Monastery. Lamma, Hong Kong\''s third largest island, is home to a large western population. The two main villages are filled with cafes and seafood restaurants. Cheung Chau still has a lively Chinese community with many traditions. Trails cover the island and seafood restaurants line the pier. Peng Chau is small and peaceful. Dining at one of the Western-style open-air restaurants with views over to Lantau is very popular, especially among tourists.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Arts of Paradise Gallery in Waikiki features the art of more than 40 of Hawaii\''s best artists.  Honolulu Academy of Arts, which opened its doors to the general public in 1927, was the dream of Anna Rice Cooke. Her goal, which became the goal of the Academy as a whole, was to create a place where, artistically, \"East meets West.\" There is a large main exhibit area that is used for temporary special exhibits. In addition, there are several other permanent galleries along with a wonderful shop and a delightful restaurant, the Pavilion Cafe, set in a tropical courtyard. The Arts at Marks Garage is a community arts center that has recently come to the fore of the city\''s thriving arts scene, with a varied program that features monthly exhibitions, screenings, performances, and lectures. The center is also home to over a dozen performance and visual arts ensembles. Other contemporary art galleries that showcase the artwork of local artists include those of Cedar Street, Louis Pohl, Nohea, Pegge Hopper and Robyn Buntin.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Honolulu boasts one of the country\''s most interesting local history and cultural archives, the Bishop Museum. Located downtown, this fascinating place was founded in 1889 by Bernice Pauahi Bishop, a member of the Hawaiian royal family. The museum primarily focuses on the islands of the Pacific Basin, but also houses a fascinating astronomy exhibit. In North Honolulu, Hawaii\''s Plantation Village recreates life on a sugar plantation through several decades. For those interested in Military history, the island of O\''ahu offers many choices. At the northern end of Waikiki, you\''ll find the historical Fort DeRussy. The mighty Battleship Missouri has been turned into a Navy and World War II museum at Pearl Harbor. Nearby, the Bowfin Memorial Park has many exhibits about undersea warfare in the last century.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music & Dance</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">All the colorful islands of the Pacific are well represented in the music and dance of Honolulu. The Polynesian Cultural Center on Oahu\''s North Shore also presents daily and nightly music and dance extravaganzas. Free entertainment is presented often throughout Waikiki. Two of the best free shows are the classic live hula show at the Waikiki Shell and Aloha Waikiki, at DFS Galleria. Lovers of classical music should make a date with The Honolulu Symphony. The reputed Symphony attracts some of the world\''s finest guest conductors and soloists. The Hawaii Opera Theatre has been entertaining lovers of the genre for years. The most popular venue for rock and pop concerts is the 9000-capacity Neal Blaisdell Arena, located between downtown Honolulu and Waikiki. The Hard Rock Cafe Honolulu also does its share to entertain the rock and pop fans visiting Waikiki.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sundown in Honolulu does not mark the end of the day, but instead, this is when the city\''s bars and nightclubs come alive as natives and visitors flock to its many entertainment venues for a night of drinking and dancing in the company of friendly strangers. The city is known to offer the best and most diverse nightlife options across the Hawaiian Islands, with everything from local bars to dance clubs pulsating to the beat of the latest tunes. Waikiki is where party-goers flock for a night of revelry and parties that go on well into the wee hours of the morning. Fusion is one of the island\''s only gay bars and is a popular nighttime destination for non-stop parties, karaoke, dancing and drag shows. More upscale options include the Zanzabar and with its Egyptian-themed opulence and Bar 35 featuring a stellar lineup of brews and top-notch DJs. Duke\''s Canoe Club, Surfer, and Mai Tai top the list for those who crave a more authentic island experience. While Waikiki is the soul of the city\''s nightlife, the North Shore is where you will find more authentic, Hawaiian staples. Whichever you choose, Honolulu is sure to please.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Luaus</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the most popular forms of entertainment for the visitor to Hawai\''i is the <em>luau</em>, a traditional Hawaiian party. Guests are served sumptuous food and drink and treated to a music and dance bonanza. The Royal Hawaiian Hotel on the beach at Waikiki, offers the Royal Hawaiian Luau, one of the best around. Germaine\''s Luau is another favorite, as is the luau at Paradise Cove. On the North Shore, the Polynesian Cultural Center offers a luau that is widely praised for its authenticity and quality.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping in Honolulu is a quintessential O\''ahu experience that ranks right up there with the island\''s fantastic beaches. Options range from vast shopping centers like the Ala Moana Center, Kahala Mall and Ward Village Shops, to the duty-free delights of T Galleria. The Royal Hawaiian Center is another top-rated shopping mall, while the Waikele Premium Outlets is the place to be for premium brands at discount prices. For bargain shopping, O\''ahu\''s Aloha Stadium Swap Meet just can\''t be beat.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From scaling the Diamond Head to lounging at the beach, Honolulu\''s outdoor offer is a varied one. Dive to the depths of the ocean in search of the island\''s colorful marine life, or carve your way through the dense foliage that fringes the volcanic mount. There are kayak and canoe tours aplenty, as well as offroad adventures and jeep tours to be had. Sailing lessons, fishing charters, and yacht tours are also quite popular.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Live Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The premier house for live theater is the Diamond Head Theatre in the shadow of the Diamond Head State Monument. Another place to see live theater is at the Manoa Valley Theater near the University of Hawai\''i. The Honolulu Academy of Arts has the Doris Duke Theatre that often presents plays and musical showcases. Other popular venues for the performing arts include the Kumu Kahua Theatre in downtown Honolulu and the historic Hawaii Theatre Center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Golf</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the main reasons visitors come to the Hawaiian Islands is the abundance of beautiful golf courses. Honolulu\''s home island of O\''ahu has a number of great choices. Coral Creek is a favorite for its lush tropical landscaping, exotic coral formations and challenging par-72 course. The Royal Hawaiian Golf Club and the Oahu Country Club are well-ranked as well.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinemaphiles can catch the latest blockbusters at the city\''s outposts of Consolidated Theaters and Regal Cinemas; modern multiplexes that promise cinematic brilliance in a comfortable setting.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (964,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Waikiki</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Waikiki Beach stretches from the slopes of Diamond Head to Ala Moana and the Ala Wai Yacht Harbor. The beach itself is a great spot for the whole family. There is a near-shore break for the children, while the more experienced swimmers surf the waves. The main thoroughfare of Waikiki is Kalakaua Boulevard. Most of the hotels, shops, and restaurants are gathered along this well-populated strip. The Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center is a must-stop for anyone in the mood for a little retail therapy. Dine on <em>pho</em>, sushi, fresh seafood or gourmet buffets at area restaurants. As for accommodations, Waikiki hotels are some of the best in the world. You can find everything from upscale, five-star establishments such as the Westin Moana Surfrider Hotel to lodgings for the budget traveler at places like the Aqua Waikiki Pearl.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ala Moana</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This diverse area is probably the first place business travelers will see, thanks to the presence of the enormous Hawai\''i Convention Center. Be sure not to miss one of the largest open-air shopping centers in the country and the Hawaiian Islands\'' premier shopping mall - the Ala Moana Shopping Center. Ala Moana Beach Park and Magic Island are area attractions that are beloved by locals and visitors alike. Restaurant Row, the stomping ground for the corporate lunch and Happy Hour crowd, is also known as the \"gateway\" to downtown Honolulu.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chinatown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chinatown is one of Honolulu\''s most colorful and exciting neighborhoods. The area has been a major gateway for immigrants to Hawai\''i. Chinese medicine and Eastern religion have a huge presence, with Taoist, Buddhist and Shinto temples sandwiched between herbalists, shops, and restaurants. Highlights of Chinatown include the Maunakea Marketplace, a local shopping plaza complete with its own ethnic food court, and the Chinese Cultural Plaza, a spacious open-air courtyard inhabited by jewelers, Asian restaurants and cultural organizations.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown/Waterfront</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the steely skyscrapers and luxury high rises that rise up along the waterfront to the restored palaces and fascinating museums on Beretania and Bernice Streets, the downtown area proves Honolulu to be much more than the glitzy tourist town that Waikiki would have us believe. Landmarks are numerous, but a few that should not be missed are the grand and graceful Honolulu Harbor and the stunning Iolani Palace. After the sun goes down, the Honolulu Symphony offers entertainment to a cultured, affluent crowd.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Manoa Valley/Makiki</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Manoa Valley, where the University of Hawaii is situated, is typical of the valleys resulting from the erosion caused by lava flows in Hawai\''i. One of the best places to view Honolulu and the Ko\''olau mountain range is from the Manoa Cliff Trail. The main attraction of the valley itself is the University of Hawaii, a research university founded in 1907 and the only one of its kind in the state. Manoa, and the nearby neighborhood of Makiki, comprise one of the major cultural hot spots on the island. While this district isn\''t marketed or publicized as a cultural destination, it is home to several galleries, museums and theater companies. Among the hidden jewels in the area are Spalding House, one of the best art museums in Hawaii, and Manoa Valley Theatre, a spirited community theater group.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">East Honolulu—Diamond Head Kahala, Hawaii Kai</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are several major tourist attractions spread out through this area. Diamond Head is great for hikers. This peak can be seen from many vantage points in Honolulu, but for outdoor enthusiasts, there\''s no better way to experience it than by hiking to the summit and gazing down at the island below. Kahala Mall, Hawaii Kai Towne Center and the Hawaii Kai Golf Course are other area attractions. Experts agree that Hanauma Bay, on the eastern tip of the island, offers some of the world\''s best snorkeling. However, if you prefer more privacy, try snorkeling or diving in Hawaii Kai. And if you\''d prefer to view sea creatures from the safety of land, head over to Sea Life Park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Honolulu—Pearl Harbor, Pearl City & Ewa</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Aside from Waikiki, this district may be the one most frequently visited by tourists. The site of the infamous Pearl Harbor attack, it is among the most famous naval attractions in the country. Millions of people visit the Arizona Memorial, Bowfin Memorial Park and \"Mighty Mo\" each year, to learn about or revisit this momentous turn of events this enclave of the city. Locals and in-the-know tourists often bypass Ala Moana Center and the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center in favor of Pearl City\''s famous Pearlridge Center for shopping.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Windward O\''ahu</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you visit Honolulu or even read about it, you\''ll likely find that the term \"Windward\" is tossed around quite a bit. Windward, to clarify, is the Eastern shore of the island. It\''s a quiet, laid-back place, devoid of all the glitz and bustle of Honolulu. Most locals will also tell you that it\''s the best part of the island. There are no major hotels or malls here, but there are plenty of restaurants and shops, and there seems to be a B&B tucked under every hillock and at the end of every street. Kailua Beach Park offers some of the world\''s best windsurfing, while Lanikai is simply one of the world\''s most picturesque beaches. This is also where you\''ll find the Ko\''olau Golf Club, consistently ranked among the best on the island by the prestigious <em>Golf Digest</em>.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Leeward O\''ahu & Central O\''ahu</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Like Windward O\''ahu and East Honolulu, Leeward (that\''s Western to all you mainlanders) is a quieter district with a few outstanding visitor attractions. Smart tourists—at least, the ones who can afford it—forego the jam-packed hotels of Waikiki in favor of the paradisiacal beach resorts of Leeward like Marriott\''s Ko\''olina Beach Club at the serene Ko\''olina Marina. Near Ko\''olina is Hawaiian Waters, a water park on a grand scale. At Makaha Beach Park, swimmers, surfers and sun-worshipers congregate every day in the spring and summer months. In winter, daredevil surfers test their skill against swells that soar to heights of 20 to 30 feet (6.09 meters to 9.14 meters).Central Honolulu isn\''t much of a visitor destination, although the famous Dole Plantation draws its fair share of tourists.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Shore</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It seems like every Hawaiian island has its own North Shore, where surfers from around the world come to brave the big waves in winter. O\''ahu is no different, and it doesn\''t stop there: It also boasts great beaches, famous parks and a mellow lifestyle. Waimea Valley is a great place to hike, ride horses and watch people dive off cliffs. There is also the Polynesian Cultural Center, which recreates seven Polynesian villages, each with their own activities and attractions.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Houston offers an abundance of live music of all types. Some bars and nightclubs showcase live bands on weekends or specific nights, while others like the Anderson Fair in Montrose clubs folksy acoustics with a 60s nostalgia that is inexplicably charming. For more country music, head to the Firehouse Saloon on the Southwest Freeway that coaxes you to surrender to its fabulous honky-tonk vibes and swing to its foot-thumping beats. Fitzgerald\''s, a Houston live music institution has been captivating local crowds since its opening in 1977. Popular bands play rock, blues, country and folk music to entertain sizable crowds. In a completely different respect, live concerts and classical performances are equally popular and entertaining.

Other artistic musical presentations also take place in this downtown music hall from time to time. The White Oak Music Hall, Warehouse Live, the Toyota Center and Arena Theater regularly hosts concert tours featuring the hottest performers.For jazz and blues lovers, there is no better place than the House of Blues and Cezanne, known for hosting two sessions every weekend. If your preference is jazz and seafood, head downtown to Sambuca Jazz Cafe for nightly performances. The management at this ritzy club books at least one national act a month.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Houston\''s extensive number of museums and galleries house a plethora of unique artifacts, gorgeous artistic creations and scientific memorabilia. Both the Museum of Fine Arts and the Contemporary Arts Museum display the work of world-renowned artists, and Menil Collection boasts one of the finest private art collections in the country.

The Houston Holocaust Museum is relatively unique and features in-depth information about the tragic events of the Holocaust. The Houston Museum of Natural Science offers three levels of fun that you\''ll be hard-pressed to view in a single day. Burke Baker Planetarium and the Cockrell Butterfly Center are conveniently located in the same building. There\''s so much to see and touch, you might want to allow two days for this outing. If the impressive history of Texas intrigues you, take a drive out to San Jacinto State Historical Park and visit the San Jacinto Museum of History and the Battleship Texas.  Without a doubt, the city\''s most interesting museum experience will be had at the National Museum of Funeral History. Not many museums in the country focus on funeral memorabilia and artifacts. The themed coffins are definitely excellent conversation pieces. For other interesting and slightly unusual museum experiences, visit the Houston Fire Museum, the Art Car Museum and the Orange Show Center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">During the course of the past century, Houston gained a formidable reputation as a world-class center for the arts. It is one of the few cities with its own resident professional companies in ballet, opera and theater. If you enjoy theatrical performances, you won\''t lack for entertainment during a visit to the city. The 17-block Theater District is home to over 200 performing arts organizations and houses some very prestigious theaters and performance halls. You can catch first-rate Broadway and off-Broadway productions at the Alley Theatre, or opt for incredible opera performed by the Tony, Grammy and Emmy-winning Houston Grand Opera. Bayou Place is one of the oldest fixtures to the downtown entertainment scene. It features theaters, concert houses, nightclubs and restaurants all under one roof. The Revention Music Theater is the resident theater at Bayou Place and offers a broad range of productions, including comedies and concerts.  Outside of the Theater District, you will also find excellent productions in other parts of the city. Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park offers free performances of dramas, comedies and musicals. Main Street Theater at Chelsea Market has two Houston locations that offer an assortment of productions. Cutting-edge, modern plays are the specialty at Stages Repertory Theatre, while Playhouse 1960 specializes in old comedies and mysteries.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you enjoy watching the latest Hollywood films in your spare time, a multitude of cinemas can accommodate you. The latest trend is the giant, multi-screen complex that features stadium seating and modern comforts, and Houston already has an abundance of these cinemas. On the West Side, visit AMC Studio 30. The northwest part of the city features Cinemark Tinseltown 290. In the Galleria area you will find Edwards Theater Greenway Place 24, and Cinemark Hollywood Movies is located on the East Side.

Dollar cinemas, like Wind Chimes 8, offer reduced ticket prices on recent Hollywood movies that just left the big theaters. If your film preferences run to artistic productions, you will prefer the films at art houses like River Oaks Theatre and the Museum of Fine Arts\'' Brown Auditorium Theater.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightclubs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Apart from its renowned live music scene, Houston has managed to weave a largely impressive net of nightlife for its locals, a blossoming scene that accommodates everything from modern EDM clubs, to laidback DJ hotspots and sensational Latino clubs. Barbarella, Houston\''s versatile bar that is both a dive and a dance club is known for its 80s disco nights, whereas the Club Tropicana is the city\''s hottest salsa and merengue club that has been hosting enthralling parties and incredible dance nights since 1999.

The retro-themed Fox Hollow on Nett Street is set out to do it all, with an exciting mix of Latin nights, DJ-centric parties and even live music gigs on occasion. Others like South Beach give you a taste of Houston\''s after-parties, and others like Stereo Live are wildly popular for their EDM acts, and have previously featured famous DJs like Steve Aoki and Diplo.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Comedy</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Houston certainly isn\''t New York on the comedy circuit, but it still has some comedy clubs that will inspire an evening of full-blown laughter. The Houston Improv Comedy Club features a line-up of seasoned comedy stars, with occasional newcomers. This popular club on the Katy Freeway performs at the Improv Houston in the Marq-E Entertainment Center. Book in advance and arrive early to get a good seat. The Station Theater also hosts improv comedy at its location on Houston Avenue. Smaller comedy cafes include Joke Joint Comedy Showcase and The Music Box Theater.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A variety of fun and entertaining festivals occur in or around Houston each year. The Texas Renaissance Festival starts in October every year and runs for seven weekends. Step back into the Renaissance period and watch a couple of knights joust at this popular event. It is definitely a one-of-a-kind experience. In October every year, the Bayou City Art Festival showcases the work of local artists and is wildly popular with art-lovers. The Texas Crawfish Festival goes on during two weekends in May and provides a double treat. Not only is the festival a lot of fun, but it takes place in scenic Old Town Spring, an area worth visiting at any time.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nature and Parks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Houston is a city of warmth and sunshine, so it should not be a surprise to find a lot of nature centers and parks in the area. Many of the parks, such as Hermann Park—home of the Houston Zoo—and Sam Houston Park, offer a broad assortment of activities in addition to the simple pleasure of communing with nature and enjoying the outdoors. You can easily turn these outings into all-day events. Popular nature centers that feature both native plant and animal life include Armand Bayou Nature Center and Houston Arboretum & Nature Center. Mercer Arboretum & Botanic Gardens is equally popular, but it focuses solely on native plant life. Be sure and bring the kids along for an educational experience that will also provide a great deal of entertainment.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (973,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This now-thriving central business district is most known for being the original townsite of Houston city, at the intersection of two bayous, a historical site known as Allen\''s Landing. Today, the city is a prime cultural and commercial hub, abuzz with a whirlwind of businesses marked by Fortune 500 companies that dot its wide streets during the day, and a frenzy of activities, events and cultural activities that ensue as the sun goes down. During the day, the downtown skyscrapers are alive with activity and the sidewalks are filled with bustling executives in designer suits. Do not let the daytime business atmosphere fool you, however. This city cares about much more than business, and it is out to prove it. When the sun goes down, the downtown area comes alive with an entirely different personality.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Catch a performance in Houston\''s renowned Theater District, which spans 17 blocks. Houston is one of the few U.S. cities with permanent, professional resident companies in opera  (Houston Grand Opera), ballet (Houston Ballet), music (Houston Symphony) and theater (Alley Theatre). The Jones Hall and the Wortham Theater Center, as well as the major sports venues of the Minute Maid Park and the Toyota Center are also located here. Another primary entertainment venue is the sprawling George R. Brown Convention Center, built in 1987 and renovated in 2001. Revention Music Center, which features restaurants, nightclubs, theaters, and concert houses all under one roof, is an asset to the downtown entertainment scene.If all of this is not enough to impress you, then give the underground tunnels and some shopping a try. A trip through this \"city under the city\" is an interesting experience that should not be missed by anyone—tourist or resident.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Midtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A dynamic neighborhood that sits southwest of Downtown, Midtown is built on principles of sustainability, and has quite a few eco-friendly projects under its belt. MATCH, or the Midtown Arts and Theater Center Houston is one of its more recent additions, and is home to a plethora of green spaces like the Bagby, and a host of dining selections that are all within walking distance of one another.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Montrose/Museum District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Developed in 1911, Montrose covers approximately four square miles, bordered by Buffalo Bayou\''s Allen Parkway on the north, the Museum District and Highway 59 on the south, Bagby and the revitalized Midtown on the east and Upper Kirby District and Shepherd Drive on the west. Find some quiet time at the Menil Collection and neighboring Rothko Chapel, the artistic vision of John and Dominique de Menil. Stop for lunch at the Black Labrador, with its traditional English fish \''n\'' chips. Sitting side-by-side around an Italian-inspired piazza, Nino\''s Restaurant and Vincent\''s Rotisserie Italian restaurants have been a Houston tradition since 1977. Nino\''s is the older, and more formal classic spot, while Vincent\''s, with its wide-open rooms, is more casual and a tad more trendy. And when the day is done, rest assured you\''ll find peaceful sleep at one of several Montrose B&Bs. Victorian charm and soft featherbeds await you at the 116-year-old Robin\''s Nest Inn.   21st-century Houston is a thriving art nexus, the home of world-class museums, acclaimed art galleries and a huge community of talented artists. At the heart of it all: The Houston Museum District, whose 15 museums and 50-acre zoological park—all within walking distance of one another and accessible by METRO Rail—form one of the largest cultural districts in the country, with more than half a million square feet of exhibition space. It\''s also one of the most vital in the nation, drawing six million visitors annually. The Museum of Fine Arts and the Contemporary Art Museum house some of the finest masterpieces in the world. If your interest in museums leans toward the historical, do not miss the Holocaust Museum Houston. It is recognized worldwide as a leading source of information about the horrifying events of the Holocaust.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hermann Park</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Running alongside the Texas Medical Center, in what can only be described as an odd blend of technology and nature, lies Hermann Park. Or perhaps the blend is not as odd as it might seem. When striving to maintain a position as a leader in the healthcare industry, a peaceful view of a nearby park might be just what the doctor ordered for stress relief.  Besides providing a peaceful view and getaway for the local medical workforce, the park offers a variety of fun options to tourists and residents. Sports enthusiasts can commune with nature while exploring the bike and jogging trails or hit the golf course for the afternoon. Families can enjoy spending the afternoon riding the train around the park and exploring the water on paddle boats. For a little cultural enhancement, Miller Outdoor Theatre offers exceptional evening performances during the warmest ten months of the Houston year. Grab your cooler and arrive early, because the grounds are usually packed with fans.  If you enjoy learning a thing or two while having a good time, visit the Houston Zoo and the Houston Museum of Natural Science. But do not try to do both in one day! The museum features three levels of amazing sights that will keep you busy for hours, and it also houses Burke Baker Planetarium and the Cockrell Butterfly Center. Combined, they definitely represent an all-day adventure. The zoo also features an assortment of exhibits that require a full afternoon to experience them all. The white Bengal tiger habitat is just one of the many popular exhibits.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Galleria/Memorial</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The prestige and glamor of the Galleria area is undeniable. Office space in one of the nearby skyscrapers is expensive, and the shopping consists primarily of exclusive shops offering designer merchandise. If money is no object, put a trip to The Galleria on your list of things to do. This glamorous shopping center showcases the best names in American and European design, with more than 375 shops and restaurants in residence. If your shopping expenditures tend to be a bit more low-key, this outing still offers a world of fun in the form of window-shopping. The ice skating rink on the bottom floor is also a popular attraction, especially at Christmas, when a lavishly decorated, three-story tree is erected in the middle of the ice.  Restaurants and clubs, like most things in the area, tend to be fairly sophisticated and cosmopolitan. Arcodoro Ristorante Italiano, Morton\''s The Steakhouse and Capital Grille are all outstanding options for fine cuisine. Uptown\''s fashionable evening scene includes the Post Oak Grill. The Memorial area, comprising of a long, languorous stretch hemmed by neighborhoods like the Energy Corridor and Uptown, consists of a vibrant culinary scene that hosts cuisines ranging from Vietnamese and Korean, to earthy Southern ones. It is also home to iFly, a premier center for indoor skydiving.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Clear Lake/Kemah</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you head south past the Loop on I-45, you will run into the Clear Lake/Kemah area. Unless you are the boat-loving outdoors type, the greatest attraction in this area is Space Center Houston, Houston\''s famous home of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration). Tours through various NASA buildings—including the original Mission Control room—and other exhibits provide a whole day of fun and enlightening activities.  If you happen to prefer the \"splashier\" side of life, you will undoubtedly love this area for its water sports and boating activities. Both Clear Lake and Galveston Bay offer ample opportunities to get your feet wet. In fact, this area has been labeled \"the nation\''s third coast for boating\" and contains one of the largest concentrations of pleasure boats in the country.  Of course, an area with ocean access has to provide delectable seafood offerings, or it simply would not be worth its weight in salt. The Kemah Boardwalk excels in this respect.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">East Houston/San Jacinto</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A visit to San Jacinto State Historical Park is a must for history buffs. The park encompasses the actual fields where General Santa Anna\''s troops were defeated by the troops of Sam Houston and other Texas patriots at the Battle of San Jacinto in 1836. Those who have watched the movies or read the history books and \"remember the Alamo\" will definitely appreciate the 570-foot monument that stands as a reminder of Texas\'' hard-won independence from Mexico. The history of Texas and its prominent leaders, both before and after this battle, is fully captured in the Museum of Texas History, located in the base of the monument.  The park\''s Battleship Texas is from a different era, but is equally impressive. Docked on a branch of the Houston Ship Channel that runs adjacent to the park, it stands as a proud reminder of its wartime service. The ship was commissioned in 1914 and is both the last of the World War I era dreadnoughts and the only surviving combat ship to have served in both World Wars—an impressive accomplishment to say the least. Tours are self-guided, and guests are free to roam most areas of the ship.  Traveling through the area also offers a chance to see the famous Houston Ship Channel. While it is not necessarily as scenic, the sight is certainly splendorous in its own way. Depending on the route taken, you can cross the channel via a toll bridge or a ferry. Naturally, the ferry is recommended for the best view.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Air&Style Association organizes the world\''s biggest snowboard contest, by now in Seefeld, half an hour from Innsbruck by car. In summer, there is the event\''s skateboarding counterpart, where international top riders from all over the world are fighting for the highest price money world-wide.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Night Life</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Innsbruck is a students\'' city: about a quarter of the city\''s population are students, and you can tell from the nightlife scene. One of the city\''s characteristics is the row of bars and pubs located in the viaduct, simply called <em>Bögen </em>by locals. Dozens of diverse bars stand side by side here, among them Plateau, Babalon, and Down Under. And of course, many places to go can be found right in the old town and its immediate vicinity, for instance the large restaurant-bar Elfer offering many different kinds of beer. The place to be on warm summer nights is the Hofgartencafé. The large discotheques are situated at the borders of the city while the ones in the centre are smaller. Blue Chip and the Couch Club are worth mentioning in that respect.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Annual Events</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Innsbruck hosts some big and internationally successful events each year.

The area\''s autumn and spring fairs also bring in thousands of visitors every year who come to see novelties from Tyrol and beyond. Elsewhere, the ultra-modern Cineplexx Innsbruck caters to film buffs while a coffee at Sillpark is the perfect way to round out your day after a shopping spree.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hötting & Höttinger Au</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The district of Hötting lies on the northern bank of the Inn river, which runs through the middle of the city. Formerly a residential area for the well-to-do, Hötting is today quiet and unobtrusive suburbia, not to mention home to the delightful Alpenzoo. The founders of this zoo had a distinctive mission in mind: to find endangered species in the wild, rear them in the zoo, then set them free again in their former Alpine habitats. You can get a rack-rail from the Alpenzoo to Hungerburg, the base station for the cable railway that takes you to the lakes and valleys lying high above Innsbruck. There is even a restaurant at the top offering a superb vantage point from which to observe the magnificent spectacle of night falling over Innsbruck.

The cloister at Stift Wilten houses a valuable collection of art and a noteworthy church museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Olympisches Dorf</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Olympic village, a recent residential development, lies to the south of the city. It sprang up and gained its name as a result of the winter games held in Innsbruck. The village contains the Olympiaworld Innsbruck. Originally only used for sporting events, the impressive site now also plays host to concerts and other non-sporting activities.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Amras</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Anybody leaving the city through the southern border is bound to spot the area\''s DEZ Einkaufszentrum, the largest shopping center of its kind in North Tyrol. If you let your gaze drift a little further, you\''ll also notice the 10th century Schloss Ambras. In addition to a striking white facade, this castle houses a well-known armory collection and a quiet park dating back to the Renaissance.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Igls</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Igls is a pleasant, peaceful neighborhood populated by affluent residents. In winter, the Bergiselschanze becomes the focus of intense competitions between the best ski jumpers in the world. Bobsled and toboggan slopes are also found nearby, including a bobsled ride designed for amateurs. All in all, Igls has earned itself quite a reputation amongst energetic and sporty visitors in Innsbruck, not least because of the hair-raising skiing opportunities at the Patscherkofel peak.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The International Istanbul Theatre Festival, the International Istanbul Puppet Festival, and Conquest Week Celebrations are held in May, and the International Istanbul Music Festival and the International Bosphorus Festival kick off in June. The International Istanbul Jazz Festival and the Rumeli Hisari Concerts liven up July and August. The coming of autumn brings the Istanbul International Biennial, Intercontinental Istanbul Eurasia Marathon, Akbank Jazz Festival, and the ARTIST: Istanbul Art Fair.Tickets are easily found at the Atatürk Cultural Center and Vakko for most cultural events.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although there are almost 100 movie theaters in Istanbul, Beyoglu is the most popular place to catch a film, and Fitas is the one of the largest cinemas in the area. Atlas Sinemasi is housed within one of the city\''s historic buildings, while Cinema Pink is a multiplex chain located in various malls and neighborhoods across the city. Rexx Cinema in KadIköy is also a popular movie theater.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The attitude toward theater has undergone a radical transformation in the last decade, and the number of theaters in the city is increasing constantly. Start at the Hodjapasha Cultural Center for a traditional flavor of theater, where Turkish dance and the whirling dervishes perform regularly. For open-air performances, book a seat at the Cemil Topuzlu Open Air Theatre that is located across the Istanbul Lütfi KIrdar Convention and Exhibition Center, and hosts a variety of musical concerts, theatrical productions and performances throughout the year. The Süreyya Opera House, a glorious opera hall from the early 20th Century, is where you can catch brilliant performances by the Istanbul State Opera and Ballet. It is also home to the festivities of the Republic Day Ball.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Planning to visit all the museums in Istanbul can be a monumental task. Some of the best ones include the fascinating Archaeology Museum and the intriguing Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts. For history and art buffs, the Kariye Müzesi (Chora Church), the Mosaic Museum, the Pera Museum, and the Istanbul Modern Art Museum would be the best places to start. For modern and military history try the Atatürk Museum, the Naval Museum, and the Military Museum. The Sabanci Collection houses a magnificent display of Ottoman art, and the offbeat Carpet And Kilim Museum is perfect for rug enthusiasts.  The main street in Beyoglu, Istiklal Caddesi, is packed with art galleries, most displaying contemporary works. International artists and mixed exhibitions feature regularly. Every bank has an art gallery or cultural center open to the public. Some of the better ones are the Akbank Sanat, Platform Garanti Contemporary Art Center, and Gallery Apel. Check out Dirimart Art Gallery and the Rampa Istanbul in the winding backstreets for contemporary artworks.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Live Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Istanbulites flock in droves to live concerts at open-air venues such as the Cemal Toplu Open Air Amphitheatre in Harbiye, Park Orman in Maslak, and various sporting arenas where live international concerts are held. Local rock and metal bands perform live in bars like Arka Oda and Buddha Bar. Peyote hosts a wide variety of live music. Jazz fans will love the Nardis Jazz Club, Salon IKSV, and Babylon Bomonti. For classical Turkish <em>fasil</em> music, the Kallavi Meyhanesi is the place to be.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Istanbul hosts a wide cornucopia for avid shoppers, and boasts of a rich, bazaar-lined backdrop where you can scour and hunt for the best bargains to take back home. From elite shopping malls like Akmerkez in the Etiler Quarter, to others like Istinye Park, Kanyon and City\''s NişantaşI, Istanbul\''s ancient streets are teeming with shopping centers of all shapes and sizes.Antique enthusiasts can find some of the best treasures in the winding lanes of Çukurcuma Caddesi, surrounded by an arsenal of neo-classical houses, while the Serdar-I Ekrem in Galata is a cobblestoned haven lined with some of the best boutiques and most unique souvenir shops in the city. The thoroughfare of İstiklal Caddesi is among one of the busiest, most crowded streets in Istanbul and boasts of a colorful shopping experience. For swanky boutiques and high-end designer stores, visit the upscale Abdi İpekçi Caddesi for satisfying retail therapy. Istanbul\''s soul-stirringly ancient streets are also home to some of the best <em>bazaars</em> or markets in the world, whether it is the Turkish allure of the iconic Grand Bazaar, the fantastic 17th Century mystique of the Arasta Bazaar with its Ottoman-themed souvenirs, or the surefire brilliance of the KadIköy, a famous food market in the city.  &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1000,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sultanahmet</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most people who come to Istanbul land feet first in Sultanahmet. This peninsula (known as Sarayburnu) juts out into the Bosphorus, the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara. Rich in history, it\''s a natural magnet to millions of tourists every year. The home of Topkapi Serayi (Topkapi Palace), Ayasofya (Hagia Sophia), the Blue Mosque (Sultan Ahmet Mosque), Yerebatan Serayi (Yerebetan Basilica Cistern), and the At Meydani (Hippodrome), Sultanahmet is filled to the brim with hotels, restaurants, cafes, bars, rug stores and cheesy souvenir shops, as well as a plethora of fascinating museums, mosques, markets and historical sites. The main drag, Divan Yolu, is the heartbeat of the area, and there are hundreds of tiny back streets and alleyways to explore the history of the old city. The labyrinthine Kapaliçarsi (Grand Bazaar /Covered Bazaar) near Beyazit University is also on this street. Sultanahmet can be a little intimidating as it truly caters to only tourists.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Eminönü</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Situated right on the waterfront on the Golden Horn, Eminönü is the end of the tramline. It is generally buzzing with activity during the day, with street peddlers selling you things you never even knew you wanted. The vast Misir Çarsi (Egyptian Spice Bazaar) is the main feature of Eminönü Square and Mimar Sinan\''s Yeni Camii (New Mosque) is a familiar landmark with its minarets standing tall above the general chaos. Ferries to the Asian side and the Princes Islands leave from the huge docks lining the shore, where you can stop by and have a <em>balikekmek</em> (fresh fish sandwich) while you wait for your vessel. The Sirkeci Train Station is also here: all trains to and from Europe begin and end their journeys here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beyoglu / Taksim</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A veritable symphony of the East and the West, Beyoglu is the pulsating heartbeat of Istanbul\''s day and nightlife. Istiklal Caddesi - a paved thoroughfare perpetually swarming with Istanbul\''s colorful <em>hoi polloi </em>- is at the hub of the metropolis, while a maze of narrow winding lanes filled with funky cafés, soulful bars, continental restaurants, historic cinemas, prominent theaters and exclusive shops shoot off in all directions around it. Taksim Square, featuring the impressive Monument to the Republic, leads the way into Beyoglu\''s bohemian open-air museum, past the Greek Orthodox Aya Triade Church and the French Consulate. A quaint old tramway carries passengers past the Rumeli Han, Çiçek Pasaji, Cite de Pera, Atlas Pasaji, Galatasaray Lisesi, and several elegant consulates. Every year the International Istanbul Film Festival, International Istanbul Music Festival, International Istanbul Theater Festival and the International Istanbul Jazz Festival are held here and in nearby districts. Beyoglu, which has been the traditional home of Istanbul\''s gay community, hosts various other annual events, including the Bosphorus Festival, Aksanat Jazz Festival and the Blues Festival.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Tünel</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is undoubtedly Istanbul\''s Bohemian Quarter, which not so long ago was perceived as a bad part of town, with its dark deserted streets and creepy abandoned buildings. However, the area has undergone tremendous development in recent years. Tiny cafes, live music venues, and open-air restaurants and bars now quietly coexist with art galleries, antique bookshops and music stores.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Karaköy</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Around 1 BCE, there was a tiny village situated on the mini peninsula of the Golden Horn where the modern suburb of Karaköy stands today. These days, Karaköy is a bustling port with a lively fish market, a hectic ferry terminal and a shady nightlife; an intriguing landscape at the mouth of the Golden Horn. Scores of locals fish from the Galata Bridge and an array of vendors peddle all kinds of goods along the sidewalks. A vast underground marketplace provides not-so-safe passage under the busy road to the entrance of Tünel. Up the hill is Bankalar Caddesi, an historical area filled with banks, art galleries and do-it-yourself stores. The historical KIlIç Ali Pasha Complex, also located here, shines in Ottoman splendor, and comprises of a mosque and thermal bath houses. The SALT Galata, a modern art museum is located in this vibrant harborside district as well. All visiting international cruise ships dock in Karaköy.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Galata</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Genoese-built Galata Tower is the most central point here. The renowned Turkish film <em>Istanbul Beneath My Wings</em> tells the story of Hazarfen Çelebi, who flew from this tower with a home-made pair of wings. The main street, Galip Dede Caddesi, is a hub of activity with shops selling musical instruments and antique books, and you\''ll also find a good dose of tiny local restaurants. The Whirling Dervishes have a home here at the Galata Mevlevihanesi (Dervish Lodge); the Goethe Institute provides locals with a good dose of culture and art; and there are countless mosques, churches and synagogues hidden away in obscure side streets.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Golden Horn</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most interesting part of the Golden Horn district comprises of the stretch of land between Eminönü and Ayvansaray, up as far as Eyüp. The Selimiye Mosque, the Fethiye Mosque and St. Steven\''s Church grace the shoreline while the Kariye Müzesi (Chora Church) and Mihrimah Mosque are further inland. The old city walls start at Ayvansaray and snake overland to Yedikapi.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Besiktas and Ortaköy</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Besiktas - which is actually dismally devoid of places to help you paint the town red - is at the center of the three-way fork that leads up the hill to Levent. Ortaköy, on the other hand, is a bustling suburb on the waterfront. Bubbling over with cafés, bars, restaurants and tea houses, this area is a popular weekend hangout for locals. Ortaköy\''s back streets are buzzing with handicraft stalls filled with trinkets and souvenirs on summer weekends. This part of town is renowned for its mosque, church and synagogue within close quarters of one another. The Bosphorus Bridge spans the waterway overhead.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bosphorus: Arnavutköy to Sariyer</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Bosphorus shore on the European side is lined with Ottoman-style mansions, high society hangouts and fish restaurants. There is only one main road and it follows the shoreline all the way to Zekariyeköy, a popular weekend getaway for the citybound.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sea of Marmara Coast: Kumkapi to Yediküle</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kumkapi is a distinctly touristy area filled with over-priced fish restaurants and not much else besides views of the sea. The coast road heads out toward the airport past the old city walls.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Asian Side & Bosphorus: Kadiköy to Anadolu Hisari</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kadiköy is a quieter version of Beyoglu with a more subdued atmosphere. The tiny cobbled lanes are filled with restaurants, cafés, bars, cinemas and shops, but most importantly, residents! The Asian side of town is where most Istanbulites live; you\''ll have a harder time with no Turkish language skills here, but it\''s worth it to pop over on the ferry and experience a more relaxed way of life. The coast road snakes past Üsküdar, a pretty suburb with plenty of fine examples of Mimar Sinan\''s work, including the Mihrimah Sultan and Semsi Pasa Mosques. Selimiye Barracks (where Florence Nightingale worked during the Crimean War) is up on the hill. Heading toward Anadolu Hisari, the road winds along the shoreline (which is less built up than that of the European side). There are plenty of parks and trees, outdoor cafés and restaurants and a string of historical buildings to explore including Beylerbeyi Palace, Kuleli Mosque, Kuleli Naval Officer\''s Training School, Küçüksu Park and Kiosk and Anadolu Hisari.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Prince Islands</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are four islands in the Sea of Marmara that attract crowds escaping the summer heat: Büyükada, Heybeliada, Kinaliada and Burgazada. Ferries leave from Sirkeci, Kadiköy and Bostanci regularly. There are no cars on the islands - the transport here is limited to horse-drawn carriages. Each island offers plenty of places to eat and sleep, and there are Greek monasteries atop the hills of Büyükada and Heybeliada.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Harbiye-Nisantasi-Sisli-Mecidiyeköy-Levent</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Military Museum in Harbiye is a good landmark from which to begin exploring Istanbul\''s business life. Nisantasi is the central shopping district, while Sisli is strictly a business district that goes all the way to Levent and beyond to Maslak. There is now an underground metro linking Taksim with Fourth Levent.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Tmol Shilshom, a literary café in this area, is a charming place for coffee and cake. The premises are the former home of Israeli writer S.Y. Agnon. There are frequent readings (in both Hebrew and English) and English poetry slams.  Talpiot, a few kilometers further south out of town, is the city\''s industrial zone and is home to the dance club Campus, as well as the live music venue, the Yellow Submarine. Clubs do not get going until around midnight, as Israelis rarely go out before 10p. The DJs keep on playing till late into the evening.  Ticho House has a cheese, wine and jazz evening every Tuesday and the Bible Lands Museum has a cheese and wine recital on Saturday nights. Churches, such as Dormition Abbey and the Church of the Redeemer, host regular concerts. Classical music and theater enthusiasts should check the schedule at the Jerusalem Theatre and the International Convention Centre.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Jerusalem has two wonderful art-house cinemas, the Cinematheque which has two screens and a very good café-restaurant, and the Smadar - a one screen cinema with a popular café attached. For mainstream releases, go to Yes Planet, which has multiple screens, IMAX Theater and a large food court.  Films are also frequently shown outdoors during the summer Jerusalem Film Festival. A trip to the Steven Spielberg Jewish Film Archive is well-worth it for those looking to learn more about Jewish history as captured on film.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the summer months, Jerusalem hops from one festival to another - providing all sorts of atmospheres and cultural experiences, (many of them free). Late May is the start of the Israel Festival, three weeks of some of the best national and international performing arts acts. Many of the performances are centered around the Jerusalem Theatre, with plentiful free concerts in the theater\''s plaza or foyer.  July plays host to the Jerusalem International Film Festival, which, in the past, has screened 150 different films over ten days. There are free public events such as mass screenings in public parks. Tickets for the screenings are very reasonably priced, with the added bonus that some films include lectures, meetings with the director and premiere parties on the lawn.  In August, the park area around the Sultan\''s Pool, is transformed into a microcosm of the world. Inca palaces and Nepalese temples shoot up for the two-week long International Arts and Crafts Fair. There are pavilions representing all manner of countries, as well as international food stands and more than 150 artists selling jewelry and craft items. The biggest pull of the evening are the concerts given by some of Israel\''s hottest contemporary performers. Sit back in the grass, with a lapful of international munchies, bask in the moonlight, gaze up at the floodlit walls of the Old City a few meters away, and let Israeli pop work its magic.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Some of Israel\''s best museums can be found in this historic city. Whether you\''re interested in traditional exhibits or modern and interactive spaces, you\''ll find it here. At the forefront is the Yad Vashem - The World Holocaust Remembrance Center, a space dedicated to honoring the victims of the holocaust. There\''s also the Israel Museum, which houses a variety of treasures like the Dead Sea Scrolls, ancient artifacts, and Judaic cultural exhibits. Other places to visit include the Bible Lands Museum, the Tower of David Museum and Bloomfield Science Museum.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1018,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Old City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The walled Old City is the center of Jerusalem (but sometimes feels like the center of the world), with Jewish West Jerusalem on its one side and Arab East Jerusalem on its other. It\''s a wonderful place to get lost in by day and to marvel at its fairytale-like beauty when it is floodlit at night. A walk around the Ramparts Walk of the city walls is recommended to get a feel for the geography of the Old City, which is composed of several different areas - the Muslim, Christian, Armenian, and Jewish Quarters as well as the highly contested Temple Mount. These quarters within the Old City can be divided into East Jerusalem and West Jerusalem.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">East Jerusalem</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Temple Mount is the location where it is said that Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son. Later, the First and Second Temples were built on this site, and it is believed that this is also the location from where the Islamic prophet Mohammed went to heaven. The gleaming gold-topped Dome of the Rock mosque, which dominates the Jerusalem skyline, stands in this compound as does Al-Aqsa Mosque.  The only remaining wall of the Temple provides the border between the Temple Mount and the Jewish Quarter. This is the Western (Wailing) Wall and Judaism\''s most holy site, where worshipers pray verbally and stick written prayers into the cracks between the ancient bricks. The Jewish quarter also contains numerous religious institutions, museums and archaeological sites, such as the Cardo, an ancient Roman thoroughfare.  Another must-see area is Mea Shearim, which is inhabited by strictly Orthodox Jews living a life devoted to the Torah and dressing in the same way they have been doing for the last hundred years. Visitors should walk around this area with respect - in modest dress, without a camera, and refraining from public displays of affection.  The adjacent areas of Nachlaot and Mahane Yehuda Market are fascinating to walk through during the day - a bustling market and a pedestrianized residential area with the sound of song floating down alleyways and different strata of society living side by side in this old part of town.  Bordering the other side of the Temple Mount is the Muslim Quarter, which is rich in architecture from the Mamluk period (1250-1516). Its souks, which wind through countless alleys, are a treat for the senses, where you can experience the scent of Turkish coffee, the cries of the market sellers and interesting merchandise ranging from hair ribbons to chicken legs to feast your eyes on.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For people watching in East Jerusalem, the Damascus Gate area and Salah Al-Din Street are a hive of activity with vendors selling produce along the roadside and service taxis coming and going from Palestinian areas all over the country.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">West Jerusalem</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The differences in language, sights, and sounds between East and West Jerusalem will make you think you have arrived in a different country. Jaffa Gate is the entrance to the Armenian Quarter and Christian Quarters. On your way in, you will pass the Tower of David Museum. The Armenian Quarter is home to some 1,000 Armenian residents, and much of the life of this community goes on behind the high walls of the Armenian Compound.  Within the Christian Quarter is the Holy Sepulchre where Jesus is said to have been crucified. Many pilgrims follow Jesus\'' last footsteps to this church along the 500-meter (1,640-foot) Via Dolorosa, which is best approached from Lion\''s Gate. The Lutheran Church of the Redeemer and the Ethiopian Compound are also in this quarter.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outside the Old City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One kilometer (0.6 miles) outside the walls of the ancient city (exit from Lion\''s Gate), more religious sites and wonderful views can be taken in from atop the Mount of Olives, home to the spectacular St Mary Magdalene, with its golden rooftop, the Chapel of the Ascension where they say Jesus rose to heaven and the Tomb of the Virgin Mary.  For fun, try the Russian Compound at night (West Jerusalem\''s bar area) and the touristy Ben Yehuda Street, Zion Square and surrounding alleyways, which have a lively mix of cafes, restaurants and specialty stores.  To get a feel for what hip locals like to do at night, go to the German Colony\''s Emek Refaim Street - a strip of eateries a couple of kilometers south of the Old City, with outdoor tables and specialty stores or the industrial zone of Talpiot (a few kilometers further south along the same road), which houses some of the city\''s dance clubs.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Johannesburg Art Gallery houses a definitive collection of South African art and the Standard Bank Art Gallery in lies at the core of city center, and has an excellent exhibit scene. The Goodman Gallery in Parkwood and the Everard Read Gallery in Rosebank are among the oldest and most established galleries, always showing the crème de la crème of local talent. The unique CIRCA on Jellicoe, housed within a strikingly modern building, showcases contemporary art by native South African artists. Other prolific galleries in the city include the Gallery MOMO, the Stevenson Gallery and Wits Art Museum housed within the Wits University.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are cinema complexes all over the city, mostly housed within large shopping centers. Mainstream films are on view from all over the world, mostly from the US. \''art films\'' are shown in the Rosebank Mall cinema complex Cinema Nouveau, and also at embassies and the French Institute of South Africa, in Parkview. Other modern multiplexes in the city are the Nu Metro Bedford Centre and the Killarney CineCentre. For offbeat movies, The Bioscope near city center, offering a wealth of indie and world movies, is your best bet.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Music is everywhere, and everything from the operatic to the sassy can easily be found. There\''s get-down blues and jazz at The Orbit in Braamfontein and jazz at the Market Theatre Complex. For classical music lovers, Witwatersrand (Wits) University offers regular recitals. The Civic Theatre (in Braamfontein, not far from Wits University) and Linder Auditorium (about 20 minutes from there) also offer the classics. Larger arenas like the Johannesburg Stadium showcase big-name national and international artists. These visiting greats can also be found at some of the big casino complexes like Carnival City. Others like Bassline, Carfax and the Radium Beerhall are also cool venues for alternative music genres.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Johannesburg\''s arts scene has expanded exponentially in the last decade, with several independent theaters cropping up all over the city. The Wits Theatre at the Witwatersrand (Wits) University in Braamfontein often shows contemporary drama. The Joburg Theatre Complex comprises of a group of four theaters that stage everything from ballet performances and productions for children, to Broadway musicals and experimental plays. Another intimate theater space in the city is the POPArt Theatre, which showcases a number of avant-garde plays and comedic performances from time to time. Venues like the Lyric Theatre, the heritage Victory Theatre and the National Children\''s Theatre are also worth a visit.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city offers numerous museums, and your first stop should be Museum Africa, founded in 1935 as the Africana Museum. Since then it has built up a collection of geological specimens, paintings, prints and photographs that represent life in southern Africa from the stone-age to the nuclear age, and beyond. In addition, the fascinating photographic collection at the Bensusan Museum in Newtown (near the Market theater complex) has a good historic art collection. For something completely different, try the SAB World of Beer (corner of Bezuidenhout and President Streets in Newtown), which depicts the history of brewing, going back to 1895. This is the date that South African Breweries (SAB) was officially registered on the London Stock Exchange. Come and sample some excellent South African beer. Or to learn more about South African history, the Anglo Boer War Museum and the Apartheid Museum can\''t be missed.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Clubs,</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bars, Pubs & Lounges</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Clubs in Jo\''burg cater to every taste — from hip hop and drum \''n bass to hard house and pop. Tanz Café, in Bryanston, combines the essence of European and Argentinean dance cafés where the music is passionate, the dance floor is large and the menu is unique. And, of course, the city\''s many bars, from the cocktail-specialist Landmark, to the glitzy Skye Bar in Sandton, Johannesburg has a diverse scene for libations and tastes. When it comes to hard-core revelry, the Madison Avenue Rivonia, one of the hippest nightclubs in the city, will keep you partying well into the night. The Rumours Lounge is excellent for its laid-back partying vibes, while the And Club and the Sands Nightclub are both popular clubs for dancing the night away.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

 (1028,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">City Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Johannesburg\''s City Center is a vibrant juxtaposition of the first and the third world. The central part of Jo\''burg (as it is known among locals), whose tall skyscrapers stand as a reminder of a previous era of commerce, has been returned to Africa. Most businesses have migrated to the northern suburbs, transforming downtown into a cacophony of African hawkers and traders who line the grids of streets in a colorful profusion. Vendors display shiny fruits and vegetables, young women scoop out <em>pap</em> (maize) and sauce, and merchants sell brightly-colored clothing. The area has been a hub for crimes for several years, although precautions and measures taken over the years have resulted in a lower rate as compared to before. Even so, visitors are encouraged to take sensible precautions: walk in a group, don\''t carry valuables, and don\''t walk around at night or on weekends in areas where there are no crowds.  To gain perspective of the city, visit the Carlton Panorama at the top of the Carlton Centre on Commissioner Street, or head underground, where you can also find the Carlton Centre Shopping Mall. This is Africa\''s tallest office building; it gives visitors an excellent view of the city and its yellow mountains, which are actually mine-dump hills.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Newtown & Fordsburg</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lying just west of the Central Business District (CBD) is Newtown, an area dominated by the revamped Victorian-era Market Theatre Complex. Originally a market for Indian traders, today this is a fascinating collection of alternative shops, theaters, galleries, bars and coffeehouses. Highlights include Museum Africa, an excellent showcase of individual citizens\'' contributions to Johannesburg\''s development, and the Workers Museum, dedicated to the struggle and ordeal that African migrant workers went through during the gold-mining era. The French Institute of South Africa is also located here.  Continue along Bree Street to Fordsburg and find Jo\''burg\''s Little India—the Oriental Plaza. This enormous bazaar consists of 275 stalls selling fabric, clothes, household goods, Indian spices and food.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Yeoville & Orangegrove</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">East of the City Centre is the multiracial Yeoville neighborhood. This area is dominated by Rockey Street, a laid-back assortment of shops, cafés, restaurants and bars. Secondhand bookstores and tattoo parlors lie side by side, while bead shops rub shoulders with rock clubs in this cosmopolitan quarter.  Continue east through Orangegrove along Louis Botha Avenue and be sure to stop by the Victory Theatre, a playhouse built in 1933 on what was then farmland. Continue traveling along Louis Botha Avenue and arrive in Norwood. This district is well-known for its buzzing restaurants and cafés. It is also lined with a smattering of bookshops, mini-markets and hardware stores. This area is equally famous for communities that have cut off entire blocks in the face of escalating crime.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Soweto</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">South Africa\''s most famous township lies southwest of the city. This neighborhood was once segregated as a pure-African neighborhood from the rest of the city as part of the Apartheid. Today, Soweto is a vast sprawl of houses, shacks, huts and dorms whose standards range from plush to woeful. Like other townships that exist on the fringes of South African cities, security is poor, but it is possible to visit with a tour group. Tours usually include stops at Nelson Mandela\''s former home, now a museum, and the Hector Pietersen Museum, dedicated to the young boy who was the first fatality of the June 1976 student uprising. Stop at the reputable Wandie\''s Place restaurant for an authentic taste of Africa. Soweto is also the home of the First National Bank Stadium, which was one of the venues for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Northern Suburbs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Leaving behind the CBD and venturing north, one travels towards Johannesburg\''s more affluent neighborhoods. The leafy suburb of Parktown is a perfect way to explore the colonial history of early Johannesburg. Many of the city\''s mining magnates of the late 19th Century lived in ornate mansions designed by the renowned architect, Sir Herbert Baker. These homes are now national monuments, that can be visited through the Parktown-Westcliff Heritage Trust.  While the suburbs just north of the city are older and more established, those further north are modern and dynamic, but possess less in the way of distinct character. Rosebank, Sandton and Houghton are some of the neighborhoods here that are replete with ultra-modern shopping malls and business districts, like the shops at Nelson Mandela Square and the Rosebank African Flea Market—nirvana for shoppers and diners, and a major hive of commercial activity.  A number of golf courses like the Bryanston Country Club and the River Club Course lie scattered around Sandton.  Drop by Nino\''s in the Rosebank shopping mall for a coffee and some people-watching, or the Liberty Life Theater on the Square in Sandton for cultural inspiration. In the northern \''burbs, tall, mirrored, futuristic office blocks reflect the city\''s vibrant life.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

One popular activity that will give you a bird\''s eye view is the Mount Roberts Tramway, just south of downtown. This aerial tram carries passengers 1800 feet up Mount Roberts, where there is a restaurant, a theater, spectacular views and hiking trails that can take you around the top or back down to the bottom. Mount Roberts\'' trails aren\''t the only ones in Juneau, there are actually more than 250 hiking trails all around the city that give visitors plenty of opportunities to get out into nature without ever leaving the city. One must-do activity when visiting Juneau is taking a trip to a glacier. There are several glaciers in and around Juneau. Also near the city is the Juneau Icefield, which consists of dozens of glaciers and is one of the largest in the Western Hemisphere. One of the glaciers that is part of the icefield is Mendenhall Glacier, which has a great visitor center and is an excellent place to start your trip to the glacier. It is popular to hire a guide or join a tour to explore Mendenhall Glacier, but there are also plenty of trails around the visitor center. During winter, Eaglecrest Ski Area is popular for skiing and snowboarding. During spring and summer (from May through September) is when the humpback and orca whales come to Juneau, so whale watching boat tours from companies like Juneau Whale Watch are an extremely popular and memorable activity. Kayaking and rafting are also popular summer activities.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Arts & Culture</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There\''s plenty to do indoors in Juneau as well. There are a number of art galleries like the Annie Kaills Gallery or the Juneau Artists Gallery. The galleries all come together to put on the Juneau Gallery Walk the first Friday of every month. To learn about the native heritage of the area, head to the Sealaska Heritage Institute in the Walter Soboleff Building downtown, to check out their exhibitions on the native peoples and cultures of Southeast Alaska. More history can be found at the Alaska State Museum and the small but interesting Juneau-Douglas City Museum. For performing arts, Alaska\''s professional theater company, Perseverance Theatre, puts on mostly plays that are centered around Alaskan themes and culture.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1038,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown Juneau is located in the southern part of the city, just across the Gastineau Channel and Juneau-Douglas Bridge from Douglas Island. Downtown is the main commercial zone of the city. Here you will find the State Capitol Building, historic landmark buildings like the Alaskan Hotel & Bar, the Governor\''s House, many museums, galleries, restaurants, shops, bars and more.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Douglas Island</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Located just across the Gastineau Channel from downtown and connected hy the Juneau-Douglas Bridge is Douglas Island. The island is generally split into two portions; North Douglas being rural and largely undeveloped, with a heliport and ski area, while downtown Douglas contains Sandy Beach, the only sand beach in Juneau, restaurants, Douglas Harbor, and most of the development on the island, including the school, library, theater and the few bars and restaurants.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Rest of Juneau</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most of the rest of Juneau is located to the north of downtown. Twin Lakes, just north of downtown, is a largely residential neighborhood and is also home to the hospital. North of this is Lemon Creek, which has many of the large big box stores like Costco, as well as the Alaskan Brewing Company. Further north is the Mendenhall Valley, which is home to two major malls, and Auke Bay where the University of Alaska Southeast is located, as well as being a popular destination for fishing in Juneau. There\''s not alot south of downtown, but one notable attraction is the Mount Roberts Tramway, an aerial tramway that transports visitors to the top of Mount Roberts, where there are facilities like a nature center, shops, a restaurant and a theater.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Hiking trails and a visitor\''s center with a floor-to-ceiling aquarium are among the other attractions of this not-to-be-missed park. At the Theater of the Seas, you can swim with dolphins, sea lions and stingrays or become a trainer for a day, putting creatures of the sea through their paces. In the Middle Keys, the Dolphin Research Center offers another opportunity for swimming with dolphins. At the Windley Key Fossil Reef State Geologic Site on Windley Key, you can see what a coral reef looks like when it\''s left high and dry, and visit middens left behind by the earliest Native American residents of the keys. Looe Key Reef is home to beautiful corals, and Bahia Honda State Park offers sand dunes, waters as clear as crystal, and views that go on forever. For an offshore adventure, explore Indian Key State Historic Site. Although inhabited for a brief period in the 19th Century, the deserted island is now a ghost town, replete with ruins overtaken by vegetation and a rocky coast that\''s teeming with life. The island is accessible only via ferry or kayak. You can also visit the 280-acre Lignumvitae Key State Botanical Site, a hardwood forest that was the home and gardens of a millionaire who put it all together in 1919 in such style that the site is now on the National Register of Historic Places.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Keys have a long and fascinating history that you can learn more about at the many museums scattered across the islands. The Custom House Museum provides a detailed chronicle of Key West\''s history. Fort East Martello Museum and Gallery is dedicated to Key West historical artifacts. The museum also has exhibits dealing with the daily life of early Key West inhabitants. The Key West Shipwreck Historeum, on the other hand, delves into a more niche subject of the islands\'' history. At this museum, you\''ll learn about how some islanders would dive for shipwrecked goods. You can also visit the Flagler Station Over-Sea Railway Historeum, to learn more about the ill-fated Henry Flagler\''s railroad.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theaters</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you would like to enjoy the theater while in the Keys you have plenty of options. The historical Waterfront Playhouse has a modest theater and shows quirky and well-known productions, including <em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</em> and <em>The Best Man</em>. Another small theater that produces professional productions is Red Barn Theater. If you are in Marathon, the Marathon Community Theater is the place to be for small productions featuring local talent.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals & Street Fairs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">No matter when you visit Key West, there\''s always a festival or fair to look forward to. The German Oktoberfest has reached Summerland Key, with a parade, live music and endless pints of beer. If you come in December enjoy the beautiful and often humorous Key West Lighted Boat Parade. Key West is transformed into a pirates heaven for a day during Pirates In Paradise. In July the Hemingway Days Festival can\''t be beaten. One of the best annual events is the Conch Republic Independence Celebration. The festival is a ten-day celebration of a time when the Florida Keys briefly seceded from the United States. The United States Border Patrol was treating the Keys unfairly and in protest the Keys seceded and humorously declared \"war.\" After a minute and without any prompting the Keys surrendered and jokingly asked for foreign aid. The festival celebrates this historic turn of events with drag races, music concerts, a parade, and a \"battle\" against the US Border Patrol.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This little island boasts more bars per capita than anywhere else in the country and is revered for its vibrant nightlife. The Mallory Square Sunset Celebration is a nightly affair that draws locals and tourists alike with spectacular sunset views, street performers, and a celebratory air. From here, the crowd breaks up only to converge again in smaller pockets at Key West\''s many bars. Irish Kevin\''s is right in the thick of it with live music and stand-up comedy every night of the week, paired with drinking games and plenty of dancing. Duval Street is Key West\''s answer to New Orleans\'' Bourbon Street, with its dazzling neon signs and sidewalks teeming with party-goers. Down Duval Street you\''ll find more refined nighttime diversions at establishments like the Porch; set in a 19th-century, Victorian Mansion, this popular bar serves craft beer alongside an impressive wine list. The Little Room Jazz Club is a polished venue for live music, with an elegant decor, indoor and outdoor seating, a large-screen TV with a live feed from the Atlantis Aquarium and fine wine to boot. Virgilio\''s on the other hand, is best known for its stellar cocktail selection, and the Aqua Nightclub for its dueling bartenders, drag shows, idol karaoke and poker tournaments.

John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park is a protected park where you can view coral reefs and colorful sea life. The state park also offers an aquarium, museum, and campsites as well as ample opportunity for activities like snorkeling, diving, and boating. Pennekamp Park is a treasure trove of local flora including wild orchids, gumbo limbo, wild cotton, strangler fig, tamarind trees, wild coffee, and mahogany trees. If you want to see endangered animals go to Key Largo Hammocks State Botanical Site where the mangrove trees grow a \"hammock\" which is basically a small island that attracts animals.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Islamorada</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Billed as the \''sportfishing Capital of the World\'', Islamorada\''s waters are home to the Conch, Alligator and Pickles reefs, and a vast array of marine life. It\''s a destination for scuba divers and snorkelers. A sunken ship off the shore of Islamorada is an especially popular spot for dives.Those interested in Keys\'' geology should visit the Windley Key Fossil Reef State Geologic Site; a reef that\''s no longer underwater. Catch a boat to the Lignumvitae Key State Botanical State Park - a virgin hardwood forest -, or visit the Indian Key State Historic Site, once the Miami area\''s county seat! Both of these are accessible only via ferry.You can also feed tarpon off the docks at Robbie\''s Marina or swim with dolphins, manta rays and sea lions at the Theater of the Seas.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Marathon and the Middle Keys</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This history of Marathon and the Middle Keys can be traced back to the 1800s, and a few residents of the islands are descendants of these early settlers. Bahamians raised tropical fruit for a living; New England fishermen searched the sea for its bounty; and in 1908, Henry Flagler\''s Overseas Railway reached Key Vaca, where the village of Marathon grew as headquarters for the railroad\''s final push to Key West. Here your adventure can include a swim with dolphins, an iguana introduction, a visit to a hardwood hammock or rainforest, and a loll on sandy beaches. Roaring jet skis and other water sports are available as well as fishing at the reefs, the flats or in the deep. To learn more about early Indian settlements, visit the Museums of Crane Point, which encompass the Museum of Natural History of the Florida Keys and the Florida Keys Children\''s Museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bahia Honda and the Lower Keys</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Big Pine Key is the center of life in the Lower Keys. Looe Key Reef off Big Pine Key is one of the Keys\'' top diving spots and one of the best reefs for diving in the world. In July each year, the Sanctuary sponsors a popular music festival promoting the preservation of the Keys\'' coral reefs. So popular is Bahia Honda State Park that campers reserve space months in advance to ensure a place in this waterfront paradise with its pristine beaches and warm waters.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Kingston overlooks what is the seventh-largest natural harbor in the world. Like a fan, the city spreads north from the harbor as far as the foothills of the famous Blue Mountains —impressive peaks that form a glorious backdrop to the whole.  What better way to combine business with leisure than to take in all that Kingston has to offer? With an eye on satisfying the most demanding visitor, this cosmopolitan city extends excellence in upscale high-rise accommodations, fine international dining, pulsating nightlife, business and financial services, shopping, and culture. Just like any major metropolitan city, Kingston has its share of street vendors, beggars and unappealing, less desirable areas, but north of the harbor and uptown, New Kingston sparkles!  Most people think of Kingston as being divided into two parts. It\''s not unlike a vibrant modern American city in that there\''s a downtown sector - stretching north from the waterfront to the busy traffic junction at Cross Roads - and also an uptown sector, which extends to the smart suburbs located at the base of the mountains. It will probably take visitors at least half a day to check out the downtown sights or maybe a bit more to encompass all the must-dos in the uptown area.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (1066,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Music abounds in Kingston. Numerous recording studios have blossomed throughout the city, giving birth to new titles and bands almost every month of the year. As with the rest of the island, buses double as mobile discotheques, and shops and bars blast reggae, ska and dance hall from mammoth speakers. Visitors can get a good idea of Jamaican music just from wandering the streets of Kingston. Better still, hit some clubs to hear live bands perform.Reggae developed during the 1970s as singers like Bob Marley and the Wailers and Jimmy Cliff gained popularity throughout the island. By the time of Bob Marley\''s death in 1981, reggae had achieved international acclaim. Both the Bob Marley Museum and the Tuff Gong Recording Studios are well worth a visit.  Friday night is the time to catch live music in town. Remember that the scene doesn\''t really start to get going until around midnight. There is also a good retro scene where vintage oldies pull in the nostalgia crowd.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater & Dance</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kingston has a year-round calendar of lively theater and performance, mostly with a local flavor. Plays often incorporate dance and include a message, sometimes concentrating on the tribulations of the poorer classes, or commentary on the slave era. That said, many performances are bawdy, upbeat affairs, and whatever your tastes, be it comedy, tragedy or political satire, there will surely be something to suit. Most of the plays feature Jamaican patois, but not so that you won\''t understand what\''s going on in a general sense.  Jamaican pantomime is a distinctive art form completely different from British pantomime, though there are nods in the direction of traditional fairytales from the British Isles. Folklore is prominent, audience participation high, and song, dance and satirical stabs at the political scene are rife.  Jamaican dance covers classical, African and contemporary forms. Kingston is blessed with having the acclaimed National Dance Theatre Company based at the Little Theatre. The troupe, famed for its elaborate, colorful costumes and African themes, was founded in 1962.  The Ward Theatre north of Parade features the city\''s primary annual pantomime (running December through April), Jamaican folk singers and other kinds of performance. The Little Theatre is home to the NDTC, whose season runs from mid July to mid August, with performances also in November and December. The Barn Theatre on Oxford Road features lively folk and jazz performances by the University Singers as well as shows by the Cari-folk Singers, a troupe renowned for preserving traditional Jamaican folksong.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Extremely popular with the locals, Kingston\''s cinemas feature a good smattering of Hollywood hits. Most are located uptown with tickets selling for cheap. Expect an intermission and to stand for the National Anthem. The most comfortable include the five screen Carib Cinema on Cross Roads, and the Palace Cineplex at the Sovereign Centre on Hope Road.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kingston has a vibrant art scene. Kick off with a visit to Kingston\''s National Gallery. The Jamaican School can be found on the first floor. Here are works by the school\''s leader, the sculptress Edna Manley, as well as paintings by the self-taught primitive John Dunkley, a Kingston barber who started off by painting his entire shop with colorful organic forms before moving on to canvas. More mystical in feel are the works of sect leader \''kapo\'' Reynolds (his figurines made of wood are particularly enchanting), and Albert Artwell, Everald Brown, David Pottinger and Osmond Watson - all of who use Rastafarian symbolism in their paintings. It is recommended that you get a guide to show you around.  Rastafarian art can be seen also at Bolivar Art Gallery, which holds works by many of the leading Jamaican artists. The Grosvenor Gallery shows both permanent and temporary exhibitions by renowned figures, or stop by the Contemporary Art Centre, owned by a local painter, and always showing some interesting exhibits.  Some of the leading hotels are good venues of artistic expression. The Jamaica Pegasus, on Knutsford Boulevard, has a basement gallery housing regular exhibitions of Jamaican art, while the neighboring Hilton Kingston Hotel possesses a great collection of works by Portland artist Ken Abendana Spencer in its lobby.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Events</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Time your visit to coincide with one of Kingston\''s many festivals.  In January, the National Gallery stages its Annual National Exhibition, a showpiece for both new artists and the more established crew.  February is the month for the Bob Marley Birthday Bash, held at the Bob Marley Museum and around the island. Celebrations concentrate on the late musician\''s birthday on 6th February. February is also the month for the University of the West Indies Carnival. This annual celebration feature steel bands, parades, mas players, soca jump ups and the choosing of a carnival king and queen.  April sees the carnival proper bursting onto the streets of Jamaica. The festivities kick off early in the month, with costume parades and all night parties. On August 6th, see The Independence Day Street Parade that wends its way through the streets of central Kingston with costumed parades and Junkanoo.  December is the month for the Devon House Christmas Fair.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1067,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown Kingston</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A great place to sample the essential atmosphere of this noisy and vigorous metropolis. Finding a way about on foot is pretty easy, since Kingston uses the grid system. If visitors get tired, they can flag down a taxi (fix the price beforehand) as rates are fairly reasonable and it\''s more straightforward than trying to tackle the chaos of the city\''s bus system.  The waterfront is a pleasant place to begin the tour of the area. Mixing alongside industrial-looking ships and warehouses, visitors get sights of fishermen and pelicans, vendors flogging root snacks, and people dozing under the shade of a palm tree.  Ocean Boulevard is the waterfront\''s breezy main strip, and its focal point is the emotionally charged <em>Negro Aroused</em> statue depicting a crouched man breaking free from bondage. This is a replica of the original, now in the National Gallery of Jamaica, by Edna Manley, wife of former prime minister and National Hero, Norman Manley, and mother of another former prime minister, Michael Manley. The highlight of the waterfront is the National Gallery, a repository of Jamaican art, with important works by John Dunkley, Carl Abrahams, David Pottinger and Barrington Watson.  The Kingston Crafts Market at the western end of Ocean Boulevard (open daily except Sunday) houses myriad little stores where you can pick up jewelry, T-shirts, carvings and richly embroidered baskets, though don\''t expect to be able to barter prices down. The area just north of the grassy waterfront forms the historic city center, though many grand, 18th-century buildings were flattened in an earthquake in 1907. In colonial days, King Street was the main thoroughfare, and despite the earthquake, it still retains a number of beautiful old buildings with columned verandas and decorative carvings. Half way up is the Parade, a large square used as a parade ground by British troops in the 18th century as well the site for grisly public floggings and hangings. The center of the parade is the shady, statue-filled area, William Grant Park. Today, following a massive face lift in the 1980s, the Parade is one of the most vibrant spots in town—music blares from ghetto blasters, traffic screeches, vendors hawk their baubles and queues for taxis and buses spill onto the road.  North of the park is the elegant sky-blue wedding cake building of the Ward Theatre, a magnet for thespians since the 18th Century and home to the annual panto as well as seasonal spectacles; feel free to nose around the inside. Further west are the ghetto areas known as the yards, where hard hitting wall murals act as territorial markers. The region is a no go for tourists - even Jamaicans from neighboring areas think twice before entering the opposition\''s turf.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Duke Street & Around</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kingston has many handsome old churches, but one of the most impressive is the octagonal St Andrew Scots Kirk, built in the Georgian manner by a group of prominent Scottish merchants, and surrounded by a gallery supported by Corinthian pillars. Upon completion, it was dubbed the handsomest building in Kingston.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Headquarters House & Gordon House</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Two blocks west of East Street is Headquarters House, a trim little townhouse once known as Hibbert House, but now home to the National Heritage Trust, which has its offices in the former bedrooms. You can explore the rest of the building; the debating chamber is on the ground floor, still furnished with original furniture and impressive portraits of Jamaican heroes, and the basement has some offbeat relics and a mishmash of art collections.  Gordon House is where Jamaica\''s parliament resides. The House of Representatives meets here most Tuesdays at 2p, and the Senate sits in chamber on Fridays at 11a. Entrance to the public galleries, for a glimpse of how Jamaica conducts business, is free.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Other Downtown sites</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Walk along North Street and you reach the imposing domed Holy Trinity Cathedral, the island\''s center of Catholicism. Gleaner Building, at the junction of North and East streets, is home to Jamaica\''s premier newspaper, the<em> Jamaica Gleaner</em>. After exploring Downtown, make your way to Kingston\''s other interesting districts.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Uptown Kingston</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The district north of Cross Roads - is where the commercial sprawl of hotels, banks, embassies and offices meets the residential areas of Hope, Mona, and Beverly Hills.  Centuries ago, uptown was mostly rural, save the odd sugar estate or livestock farm. But Kingston\''s wealthy merchants soon bought up the land, seeing in it a chance to escape the noise and bustle of the waterfront area. The process continues, and you will be able to spot newer, more fashionable residential quarters as far north as the foothills of the Blue Mountains.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">New Kingston</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The heart of uptown is a pulsating urban centerpiece dominated by high rise financial buildings bounded by Trafalgar Road, Half Way Tree Road and Old Hope Road. It is likely that your hotel will be located here and it\''s a good area for restaurants and bars too. You can also easily walk to all the most interesting sights from here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Half Way Tree</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This busy quarter about a mile west of New Kingston used to be a tiny village, dominated by the parish church of St Andrew (always open; free). It\''s one of the oldest churches on the island, a tranquil, 17th-century red-brick building with delicate stained glass, and marble wall tablets commemorating Jamaican civil servants and English soldiers. Half Way Tree\''s central plaza, now a busy shopping area, was where farmers would rest as they traveled towards the city\''s main markets. The eponymous cotton tree under which they rested has long since gone, but a clock tower now stands in its place, erected in the early 19th Century as a memorial to the British King, Edward VII.  East of Half Way Tree, and visitors hit Devon House on Hope Road. This impressive edifice was built in 1881 by Jamaica\''s first black millionaire; it has fine landscaped grounds where visitors can stop for a snack or a drink and a tour of the house is well worth considering.Half a mile up Hope Road brings one to Jamaica House (closed to visitors), used as the Prime Minister\''s office, and King\''s House - the official home of the governor-general. Tourists can get a tour of the staterooms in this impressively restored 19th-century house. Hope Road is also home to the much-vaunted Bob Marley Museum. It then forks up towards the Hope Botanical Gardens and Funland Jamaica; the latter is a haven for kids, with great rides and interactive spaces.For those with wheels, consider driving into the Blue Mountains from here, or at least going up onto Skyline Drive, a road noted for its stunning views over the city and across the harbor to Port Royal. You can get there by following Barbican Road to its northernmost edges, then join Jack\''s Hill Road to Skyline Drive.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

These take place at Klezmer Hois and Alef.Many of the city\''s bars offer live music, often jazz. These are great places to meet friends or new people. They vary in atmosphere and style from pub-style locals to underground bars in classic Gothic cellars. Traditional favorites are Harris Piano Jazz Bar, U Muniaka and Klub Indigo. But the best places where you can listen life music in the evening are: the Piano Rouge or Stalowe Magnolie, which offers jazz and pop music. There are also popular concerts of classical music in churches like St. Peter and Paul church, St. Adalbert church, Bonerowski Palace or Piwnica pod Baranami where visitors can hear Chopin music.Kraków - like all Polish cities — used to go to bed early, but not anymore. There are now many dance clubs that stay open until wee hours of the morning. For those who wish to have fun and go dancing there are a lot of options, including Frantic Club, Shaker\''s, or Baccarat.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kraków has some fine museums, several of which are quite unique. Don\''t miss the famous Czartoryski Museum, the site of the famous painting of Leonardo da Vinci\''s \"Lady with Armine\" and Rembrandt\''s \"Landscape of Good Samarytanin\". For anyone with a love for art, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Krakow must definitely not be missed. The  Kraków History Museum, located in the baroque splendor of the Krzysztofory Palace is a riveting journey of history from the 16th through the 20th century. The Jan Matejko House exhibits exceptional paintings of the eponymous Polish painter and is worth a visit, as is the Manggha Center of Japanese Art and Technology.It is hardly surprising that the city that birthed several Polish artists who left their mark long after they were gone will be anything but teeming with a host of art galleries, exhibiting everything from nuanced, fine art collections, to avante-garde specimens of contemporary art. Some of the city\''s best art galleries that must not be missed include the MOCAK, the Nova Gallery, the Olympia Galeria, and the Bunkier Sztuki housed within Planty Park.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1096,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Old Town</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Old Town is one of the largest (and most concentrated) collections of historical buildings anywhere in the world. Occupying the very center of the city, this district is separated from the rest of the city by a belt of parkland. This green area (now popular with cyclists and walkers) was once where the defensive walls and a moat were located. Steeped in history, this medieval old town was one of the first towns to enter the list of UNESCO\''s World Heritage Sites. In its heyday, the Old Town was the seat of political power, which saw King Sigismund III Vasa\''s reign, until the shift to the current capital of Warsaw in 1596. A powerful surge of history grips the entire district, its storied past palpable even today. You will be mysteriously drawn toward the magnificence of the Rynek Główny, or the Main Square, known as Europe\''s largest medieval town square. Surrounding this glorious square are a wealth of monumental landmarks from a regal era, including St. Mary\''s Basilica (Kościół Mariacki), Church of St. Wojciech (St. Adalbert\''s) and Church of St. Barbara. A jumble of aristocratic buildings hearken back to memories of the city when it once teemed with nobles. The Town Hall Tower, reaches for the skies in its imposing form next to the Sukiennice, a Renaissance-era hub of cloth trade that also houses the National Gallery of Art.The Royal Road, Old Town\''s main thoroughfare as well as the historic path that once witnessed regal coronations, slices the district into parts, and is dotted with several landmarks like the St. Florian\''s Church and the Kraków Barbican. The Wawel, the royal complex that consists of the castle and the eponymous cathedral sits along a verdant stretch of the Vistula River in Old Town, still resplendent in its age-old glory. Traditionally this was where the best and most fancy shops were located, where the finest restaurants could be found and where the most desirable hotels were situated. These days, with the advent of shopping malls and entertainment centers well outside the center and with modern, well-equipped hotels also some distance away, this traditional dominance is being somewhat challenged.However, the ever-increasing number of tourists means that the restaurants are flourishing, the hotels are full and the shops very much cater to tourists. The locals too love nothing more than a pleasant Saturday stroll through the Old Town.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Kazimierz District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Brought to the world\''s attention by the movie \"Schindler\''s List,\" the traditional Jewish area is coming back to life after years of neglect.Kazimierz was named after Casimir the Great who gave the town its charter in 1335. In that era and for centuries afterwards, it functioned as a separate town. It had a separate administration and was also physically separated from Kraków by an arm of the Wisla river. A bridge was built in 1802 and finally the section of the river was completely filled in, forming what is now Ulica Dietla.Within the boundaries of Kazimierz is an area called Stradom. This was also originally independent but was incorporated into Kazimierz way back in 1415. There are many fine churches and historical buildings here.The Jewish area of Kazimierz is the site of a handful of synagogues and other important monuments, such as the cemetery. Some landmarks of importance include the Ethnographic Museum of Kraków, the Galicia Jewish Museum, and the Corpus Christi Basilica. Over the past few years many new cafés, restaurants and hotels have been opening up.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This area is made up of the sections of Kraków that lie outside the Old Town Walls. One of its districts is Zwierzyniec, which used to be the royal hunting grounds and now contains the popular 48 hectare Blonia Meadow. There are many other fine ancient buildings to be found here, including wooden churches. The district is known for its festivals and strong sense of tradition.Bronowice is a green and leafy suburb that was once a separate town. It is known throughout Poland as the location of the famous \"Wesele\" (Wedding), a popular Polish play. Other suburbs of note are Kleparz (north of the city), Wesola, Podgorze and Nowa Huta.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nowa Huta</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1949, the new Communist rulers of Poland decided that the country needed to be industrialized. Kraków, as a seat of intellectual power with a long history of rebellion and dissent, was seen as a distinct threat. A huge industrial and workers residential complex was built just outside the city. A massive metallurgical plant was constructed which immediately began spewing a toxic blend of dirt and pollutants. The monuments, churches, buildings and streets of Kraków were soon affected and began to decay. Today, much has been done to alleviate this problem and the air is getting cleaner.While Nowa Huta is the city\''s relatively newer district, it is also the most densely populated. It is well-known for its sprawling size and typical Socialist architecture. However, it does have several redeeming features: it is more open and spacious than the city\''s other districts, it is close to several forests and parks and it contains two picturesque artificial lakes. Some of the architecture here is also noteworthy. Notable landmarks include the PRL Museum, the  Arka Pana Church, and the Roman Catholic Parish of St. Bartholomew and St John.  Each district offers a different perspective on the past and together they make up what is one of the most historic and beautiful cities in the world.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Like hustling, bustling Tokyo, there are parts of the city that resemble any other Japanese metropolis, especially the downtown area, where you will find a throng of huge department stores in the vicinity of Shijo, a congregation of fine hotels around Kyoto Tower, and exciting nightlife and entertainment spots at Pontocho in the Gion district. There is, however, an important historical fact that sets Kyoto apart from other urban centers: It was never bombed during World War II. For this reason, it is possible to wander the older streets of the city and get a good idea of how life used to be in the medieval days of artisans and courtiers, merchants and samurai. You can still find streets lined entirely with wooden buildings, as in the weaving district of Nishijin, for example. Some of these structures are more than 100 years old.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (1114,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater and Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If stage arts are your passion, you are in a some real treat in Kyoto. Here you will find colorful <em>kabuki </em>spectacles, stylized Noh drama, the craftsmanship of <em>bunraku</em> puppet theater, and the comedy of <em>kyogen</em> pantomime. You will delight to the eerie and otherworldly sounds of <em>gagaku</em> court music, and even the rituals of <em>Sado</em> (the tea ceremony) can be highly entertaining. Fortunately, you do not have to travel all over the city to witness such an array of Japanese traditions. Just pay a visit to Gion Corner Theater in the heart of the city, where a sampling of these many performing arts can be seen twice daily from March through November. For something really special, also check out the Pontocho Kaburenjo Theater, where you can see live performances of the traditional geisha dance, known as <em>Kamogawa Odori</em>, which combines dancing, singing and <em>Kabuki</em>-like theater.  Another must-see is the Minamiza Theater, which has been staging <em>Kabuki</em> theater since 1615.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you prefer your entertainment on the move, rather than viewed from a seat in the audience, you are also in luck. Perhaps no other city in Japan has such famous local festivals, such as Aoi Matsuri in May, the parade of floats at the Gion Matsuri in July, and the huge bonfires of the Daimonji Fire Festival in August. Each October, more than 2,000 people in period costumes take to Kyoto\''s streets in celebration of the \"Festival of the Ages,\" or Jidai Matsuri, wending their way from the old Kyoto Imperial Palace to the spacious grounds of Heian Shrine.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As the sun sets and you begin to yearn for a healthy dose of nightlife, look no further than the Gion district and the downtown streets nearby. This is the traditional playground of aristocracy and the working class alike, where <em>mizushobai</em>, or the \"water trade,\" has been practiced successfully for centuries--and still is! You will most certainly want to pay a visit to Pontocho Dori, opposite Gion and just west of the Kamo River. This long, narrow street is lined on both sides by bars and restaurants. It is a fun place to explore at night, and you will certainly want to pop into some of the more inviting spots, such as live house Taku Taku with its big-name bands and Butterfly Club with its stylish modern motif.  A word to the wise, however - some of the buildings you will see here actually <em>are</em> geisha houses. Your curiosity may be piqued, but venture inside with caution. Not only are they terribly expensive, they are usually off limits to non-Japanese visitors as well. But if you would like to see live geisha dances in Pontocho, without the high prices, they are performed at Kamogawa Odori at Pontocho Kaburencho every spring. For less traditional, more contemporary evening entertainment, take a stroll from Pontocho to parallel Kiyamachi Dori or perpendicular Kawaramachi Dori. These streets provide a lively collection of eateries and watering holes that offer all comers a convivial welcome. Drop in at Kyoto\''s popular Irish bar, K6, for a pint of Guinness; it\''s one of the city\''s best known drinking spots. For a night out Japanese-style, sit at the counter bar of a typical <em>nomiya</em> (drinking spot). After a long day of temple-hopping, there is perhaps nothing more relaxing than to sip sake (rice wine) and nibble <em>otsumami</em> (pub grub) in the company of friends because wherever you go, you will be among friends in Kyoto, one of the most hospitable and fascinating cities in the world.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Brewery Tours</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For <em>sake</em> lovers, the city has a wide variety of bars and breweries, mostly concentrated in the Fushimi district. Here, the quality of water, and history of rice cultivation has led to the production of some of the country\''s best rice wine or sake.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Art</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While much of Kyoto itself is like one big open-air museum, thanks to its elegant historic architecture and adherence to centuries-old cultural traditions, the city has an excellent selection of museums exhibiting everything from ancient Japanese art to more modern interpretations. A few of these include the Kyoto National Museum, Kyoto Museum of Traditional Crafts Fureaikan, and Kyoto International Manga Museum.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1115,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Central Kyoto</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Like other major cities in Japan, central Kyoto is packed with things to do and places to see. Spread across several wards, including Nakagyo-ku, Higashiyama-ku and Shimogyu-ku, visitors can find everything from high-fashion to ancient culture. Two important Buddhist temples, the Nishi Hoganji and Higashi Honganji, are located right near Kyoto Station, while elegant, Japanese style lodgings can be found at Hiiragi-ya. The popular Gion district, Kyoto\''s most famous Geisha district, is full of shops and restaurants, and is perfect for a stroll, particularly down Hanami-koji street, which is lined with traditional wooden merchant houses. For something more tranquil, the stepped approaches to Kiyomizudera are the ideal place to enjoy the sights and smells of cherry blossom season.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sakyo-ku</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Home of the beautiful and often-photographed Ginkaku-ji (Silver Pavillion) temple, Sakyo-ku covers the East and Northeast areas of Kyoto. Largely residential in the South, with strict restrictions placed on the construction of tall buildings, and mountainous in the north, this is a great destination for those that want to escape central Kyoto. The cold months of January and February bring the Setsubun Festival to Yoshida Shrine, while the Honen-in Jodo temple is a perfect place to enjoy the peace and tranquility of this ward all year. Sakyo-ku is also home to Kyoto University.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ukyo-ku</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Full of beautiful scenery and many historical and religious sites, Ukyo-ku covers a large area of Kyoto to the West and Northwest. A few of the prominent sites include Jingo-ji, a Shingon Buddhist temple that dates back to 781, and Tenryu-ji, a temple of the Rinzai sect that is well-known for its dry landscaped gardens. Visitors might also want to stay for lunch at Tenryu-ji Shigetsu, where they can sample the six flavors of Zen vegetarian cooking. For hiking enthusiasts, the Atago Jinja Shrine is located atop the highest point in Kyoto\''s western mountain range.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kita-ku</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though a mainly residential area, Kita-ku still has a number of things worth seeing, including Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavillion) and the famous Daitoku-ji complex of Zen temples. But if you\''re visiting Kyoto in April, be sure to visit the Hirano Jinja shrine, famous for its cherry blossoms. Because of its location just north of busy Central Kyoto, seeing this part of the city is an easy and convenient diversion. Before you head back south though, finish off a trip to Kita-ku with an adventurous meal of blowfish at Uotake.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Arashiyama</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lying to the west of Tokyo, Arashiyama is lauded for its natural beauty. Nestled in the base of the eponymous mountains, the area\''s top attractions are the otherworldly bamboo groves, the Zen Buddhist Tenryu-ji Temple with its ethereal gardens set amidst the mountains, and the hilltop monkey retreat of Kameyama-koen Park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fushimi</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Southern Kyoto\''s Fushimi district\''s claim to fame is the monumental mountain shrine of Fushimi Inari, belonging to the Shinto sect and welcoming thousands of tourists and pilgrims every year. Also known as the city\''s <em>sake</em> district, the district\''s canal-lined streets are home to a number of historic breweries like the Gekkeikan Okura Kinenkan that even has a museum dedicated to the art of <em>sake</em> production.&nbsp;</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

See the Paris Las Vegas with outstanding replicas of the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe and <em>magnifique</em> Parisian atmosphere and charm. The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas is also an impressive hotel with a nice casino that is very popular with the most trendy of visitors and celebrities. At the \"bottom,\" or south end, of the strip, risen from the ashes of the Hacienda Hotel, now stands the magnificent Mandalay Bay with its tropical atmosphere and a pool with waves you can actually surf. At the top of the Strip, you will find the Stratosphere Tower visible from miles away. It was the highest free-standing building in the western half of the United States, at the time it was built. Thrill seekers can spin 900 feet (274 meters) above the air, with only the city lights beneath their feet in this heart-stopping ride. From gondola rides at Venice-inspired St Mark\''s Square to admiring art at the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art or taking in neon views from the top of The High Roller, the sheer variety of things to do will leave you spoiled for choice.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown: Fremont Street and the Arts District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The original Las Vegas, where people hung out in the 1930s and early 1940s, is still thriving, but with a modern face known as the Fremont Street Experience. Some tourists actually prefer this area to the Strip because room prices are generally lower, it\''s an easy walk from one casino to the next and it\''s reminiscent of the early, nostalgic days of Las Vegas. In addition, there are famous hotels such as The Plaza (formerly known as Union Plaza), overlooking Fremont Street, and the classic Golden Nugget. For nostalgia buffs, there is also the Golden Gate Hotel Casino, renovated to its earlier classic glory and appearance and still famous for their shrimp cocktails. Downtown Vegas is also home to another monument to its infamous past with the Mob Museum.The 18b or the Downtown Arts District is where you\''ll find quirky galleries side by side bohemian boutiques, bars and lively cafes. The heart of the city\''s creative movement, this neighborhood is in a constant state of reinvention and growth. With more of a local vibe than DTLV or The Strip, this is the place to experience a different, more alternative side of the city.  Drop by on the first Friday of the month for a lively atmosphere fueled by art events and explore the art houses and studios that feature everything from famous to upcoming artists that call Las Vegas home.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Off-Strip</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In recent years, hotels have sprouted up near the Strip, which are conveniently accessible by shuttle bus, taxi or car. Some of the better known of these are The Orleans, the Rio Suites and the Gold Coast on Flamingo. Further north on Sahara, is the Palace Station, the granddaddy of the Station Casinos. To the east, there\''s the sprawling Las Vegas Convention Center and further south, between Flamingo and Tropicana, east of the Strip, you will find the \"must-see\" Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Boulder Strip</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This has become something of a phenomenon in itself. The Boulder Highway was once a sprawl of small motels and businesses, leading from Fremont Street out to the city of Henderson and beyond that to Boulder City and Boulder Dam, also known as Hoover Dam. But in recent years it\''s become the \"Second Strip\" with its proliferation of large, popular hotels and casinos including the Boulder Station Hotel and Casino, one of the first properties to offer child-care at a nominal fee for children of both guests and non-guests, and Sam\''s Town Hotel and Casino, which has become the high standard of western-theme resorts with its Mystic Falls Indoor Park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Summerlin</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Located in the far northwest section of the Las Vegas valley, Summerlin is a planned community with homes, shops, recreational activities, festivals and concerts. A wonderful accommodation in this area is the Suncoast Hotel and Casino. Outdoor adventure is just a hop-skip away here and the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area located to the west is a great place to escape the frenzy of The Strip. Nearby, the Shelby American, Inc. Headquarters offer self-guided tours of their manufacturing facilities, a real treat for automobile fans.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Las Vegas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city of North Las Vegas has the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, a major tourist attraction in itself, as well as Nellis Air Force Base, one of the strongest military bases in the United States and home to the flying Thunderbirds. As far as accommodations are concerned, there are several popular spots including The Fiesta and Texas Station Hotel and Casino. There is also the Santa Fe in northwest Las Vegas. Much more low-key than its larger-than-life neighbor, Las Vegas still has plenty to offer visitors. Topmost on your list should be a helicopter tour. Operators like 702 Helicopters take visitors on a thrilling ride over major attractions like the Las Vegas Strip, the Grand Canyon and the Las Vegas Valley! If you love an active lifestyle, then the Aliante Nature Discovery Park is a great way to spend a fun day out with the family.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beyond Las Vegas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For day trips that are well worth your time, check out nearby Boulder City, Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam to the east and southeast. To the west, there is Red Rock Canyon and beyond that is Spring Mountain Ranch State Park.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

For a small city of 125,000 people, it has a world-class opera, as can be seen in performances at the Opéra de Lausanne, ballet, chamber orchestra (Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne) and more theaters per capita that rivals other European counterparts. Popular theaters include the Théâtre Sévelin 36 specializing in contemporary dance, the Théâtre du Vide-Poche, an intimate venue featuring comedy and musical performances, and the Théâtr\''onze, often hosting jazz and French folk performances.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Some of Lausanne\''s most popular museums are the Musée Olympique, the Musée de Design et d\''arts Appliqués Contemporains, the Musée cantonal des Beaux-Arts and the Fondation Claude Verdan). The Collection de l\''art Brut is a small museum dedicated entirely to amateur artists, known as \''outsider art\'', while the Fondation de l\''hermitage excels in a wonderful lakeside location and features several short-term exhibitions. Located on avenue de l\'' Elysee, the Musee de l\''elysee is small photography museum housed within a historic building.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is a city that insists on constant entertainment: Summer festivals, (Le Festival de la Cité, Montreux Jazz Festival), street performances; twice-weekly markets (Marché du centre and the <em>Marché aux puces</em>—flea market); free concerts in ancient churches (Cathédrale de Lausanne, St-François Church), choirs, jazz clubs (L\''arlov Jazz or VO), free-for-all concerts in tiny cafés (Le Café de l\''hôtel de Ville). In short, name it and you can find it in Lausanne. Not to be missed are the Lausanne Carniva, the Electrosanne Festival, the Lausanne Underground Film & Music Festival and the Les Printemps de Sévelin Festival.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Added to this mix are awfully funky cafés, some of which showcase trendy bands like Bleu Lézard, while others are in prime people-watching locations, like the Le Café Romand. A surprisingly hip youth culture with very plugged in clubs such as MAD and D! Club also rule the roost in Lausanne.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1154,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ouchy</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are only two distinct neighborhoods in Lausanne: the beach and the city. Like most lake or seaside cities, the beach is where the city people head as often as possible. Lausanne\''s closest beach is in a district called Ouchy. It is where you will find open-air movie theaters, rollerbladers, ice skaters, cyclists, people strolling, swimmers that dive into Bellerive, visitors to the Olympic museum, long stretches of boardwalk, sunsets over Lake Geneva, French tourists, and sailors (<em>Ciels Bleus</em>).  The activities on the largest freshwater lake in Europe are practically endless. You can sail, fish, swim, water-ski, wakeboard, windsurf, or all of the above. Summer is short in Switzerland, so once the temperatures warm up, the inhibitions come off: this is playtime and the Swiss and tourists alike take to the water in droves. But don\''t worry, there is plenty to go around, literally: The lake is 72.3 kilometers (45 miles) long.  Although it sounds pretty unbelievable, spending time along this lake in the summer beats hanging out in the more famous places like Nice. No <em>faux</em> glamor, no polluted noisy streets nearby, just pure bliss. The Musée de l\''elysée is also located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Vidy</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In towns like Vidy, a few kilometers west, there are easy-going folks swimming, fishing and dining, small pedestrian paths to walk along, beautiful turquoise water, quaint cafés with lake views, and all this without the ridiculous drunken crowds that race to the traditional beaches of France and Italy. And while you are less likely to come across a topless beach in Switzerland - one can vouch for the nudist capacity of Vidy beach.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city is where you will find upscale stores Bang & Olufsen, A L\''Emeraude, tourist attractions, excellent restaurants, cafés, parks, and all the best of the big cities without the crime and the grime. Most tourists head to the Place St. Francois where you will find the church of the same name (St-François Church) and hip café-restaurants like Le Café Romand. Keep the hip places on your left and you will wind up on rue de Bourg, the main ritzy shopping street in Lausanne. Turn left at the Banque Cantonale Vaudoise, which has a logo that conveniently points the way, and you will walk right to Place de la Palud.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Old Town</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lausanne\''s Old Town has its own attractions, such as the Madeleine Statue and the Town Hall but it is also a main hub of Lausanne. This is car-free, bus-free territory, where the pedestrian rules. From here, you can walk to the Palais de Rumine and its many museums, rue Saint-Laurent, the Cathedral and just about everywhere else. The grand Château Saint-Maire and the Museum of Contemporary Design and Applied Arts are also located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Flon</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lausanne is hilly, walkable and entirely livable. There are a few nightclubs in the alternative neighborhood of Flon, most notably MAD, which plays host to some pretty good live shows. But mostly, this is a city worth visiting because it is accessible and clean with a long history and a <em>joie de vivre</em> that rivals its Latin neighbors.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Leipzig\''s city center has been completely refurbished since German reunification and its magnificent historical buildings once again bask in their former splendor. A prime example is the Hauptbahnhof, an awesome turn-of-the-century construction which used to be Europe\''s largest train station, but which has now been transformed into a mecca for shoppers. Over 100 shops and boutiques now compete for consumers\'' hard-earned euros. In short, anyone who was familiar with Leipzig before 1989 would scarcely recognize the city today. The motto \"Leipzig is coming!\" is an extremely appropriate one for this forward-looking city.Yet the traces of Leipzig\''s recent past are still visible. If you take a walk down some of the side-streets outside the city center, you can\''t help but notice the remnants of the socialist East German era. Abandoned old buildings are overshadowed by enormous, prefabricated high-rises, which although spruced up, still stand out as hulks and mar the otherwise harmonious cityscape.Most of Leipzig\''s major sights are easily accessible on foot, and are often interspersed with tree-lined parks and squares, making a stroll through the city center a relaxing and enjoyable experience. Good public transport links also make excursions to the outlying areas a simple matter.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Other sights include the Völkerschlachtdenkmal (the monument of the Battle of the Nations), the Museum Zum Arabischen Coffe Baum, the Schillerhaus and the Sportmuseum. The city\''s more recent past can be explored in the Museum in der Runden Ecke and in the Stasi Bunker.The Museum der bildenden Künste, the main fine arts museum, offers its visitors a glimpse into different artistic periods and genres. The nearby Naturkundemuseum explores the relationship between man and nature, as well as some more general ecological issues. For music-lovers, Leipzig has the Johann Sebastian Bach Museum, the Mendelssohn Haus, and the Musical Instruments Museum. The latter is housed in the Grassimuseum, which also includes the Museum of Ethnology and the Museum of Arts and Crafts. Others include the Egyptian Museum and a Technical Centre. Further collections tailored to more specific interests are the Museum of Printing, the Camera and Photo Museum and the Saxon Chemists\'' Museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Those who prefer to spend their day and money on jewelry, stylish clothing or souvenirs can follow their heart\''s desire during a leisurely walk around the shopping districts of the town center. Here, numerous boutiques and shops make for an enjoyable afternoon. A large number of specialist shops attract many a curious passer-by in the Mädler Passage, Messehofpassage, and Petersstraße, as well as in the Messehaus Specks Hof and Barthels Hof. The Städtische Kaufhaus and other department stores offer at least as much as the newly built shopping centers. The regular markets for fresh produce, flowers, ceramics and books all have vendors calling out for the attention of potential customers as they seek to sell their quality wares.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Leipzig catches the hearts of sports fans, since all can have a good romp, or at least contentedly spectate. All around Leipzig, enthusiasts jog through parks and skaters speed along streets. Other appealing activities include swimming, cycling, rowing, fishing, volleyball and fencing.One of Germany\''s largest stadiums, the Red Bull Arena, is built here and has seen many tears—be it in victory or defeat. There\''s also the Scheibenholz racetrack, where so many have tried their luck with a flutter of hope. Other sporting events include international tournaments such as the German freestyle wrestling championship, held in the summer, and the international women\''s tennis Grand Prix in autumn. For those seeking something more relaxing, Leipzig has some romantic lakes where visitors can indulge themselves by soaking up the afternoon sun.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After a hard day\''s sightseeing, visitors may well be in the mood for a taste of Leipzig\''s nightlife. A good starting point is the Moritzbastei, a youth and student club which stages concerts and exhibitions in its underground vaults. In the summertime, plays and open-air films are organized around the city while the many beer gardens thrum with live music and a relaxed buzz. The nearby marketplace provides a second possibility with its jazz festival and other varied events running for the most part of the summer. After 10p, the bars in Barfußgäßchen and Gottschedstraße start to amp up and are perfect for sampling the local brew.The somewhat less central Karl-Liebknecht-Strasse is also home to an exciting array of restaurants and pubs which will delight gourmets.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Werk II on Connewitzer Kreuz is a multicultural center which organizes jazz concerts and dance performances. All the adjoining districts have smaller clubs with rock or jazz music, while discos provide an exciting venue for dancing through the night. The most important event of the year occurs no less than twice: Europe\''s Honky Tonk festival, with over 100 bands, takes place in May and November. From the smallest pub to the most exclusive restaurant, the most diverse establishments take part in this festival, which is widely regarded as the biggest pub festival in the world.For those inclining more towards classical tastes, the voices of the Thomanerchor make hearts soar to captivating heights, as do the soloists and choir of Leipzig\''s famed Gewandhausorchester, with its classical and contemporary songs. A visit to the Opera House is also highly recommended.The Schauspielviertel is the focal point of the most important theatres in Leipzig. The Krystallpalast Varieté in Magazingasse presents a repertoire combining music, theater, dance and entertainment. Other theaters competing for attention include the Schauspielhaus, Theater hinterm Eisernen, Theater der Jungen Welt, Puppentheater Sterntaler, Theater im Globus and the Lofft. Current theater productions include drama, fairy tales, musicals and opera for children, as well as comedy. The Schaubühne in Lindenfels is noted for its attempts to fuse theater and film.The potential is broadened by numerous small-scale and varieté performances from a wide range of talented artists. In October, the Lachmesse casts its spell over enthusiasts of cabaret and theater, attracting ensembles from all over the world. The most famous cabarets, the Leipziger Pfeffermühle and the Academixer, are rounded off by others who have also made a name for themselves in the cultural scene - the Leipziger Funzel and Sanftwut. In addition, the Leipziger Brettl, a lively cabaret in Gambrinus, should not be forgotten as it too enriches the extensive theatrical essence of the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The cinematic experience can be seen, heard and felt in the Bofimax, Regina-Kinocenter or Schauburg cinemas. The highlight for movie-goers is the annual International Festival for Documentary and Animated Films, which has attracted thousands of viewers to Leipzig every October since its inception in 1957.So let your curiosity lead you out into Leipzig\''s rich and multi-faceted entertainment scene—you\''ll be surprised at what you find!</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The aroma of coffee and freshly baked cakes wafts from the atmospheric cafés and bars which line the square, many of which spill into the crooked little alleyways nearby.The Altes Rathaus—a beautiful Renaissance building erected in just nine months—used to be the city hall, but now houses the Stadtgeschichtliches Museum; a fascinating museum depicting Leipzig\''s history from Medieval times to the present day. The northwestern corner of the square contains two other historic buildings: <em>Webers Hof</em>, a typical bourgeois home, and <em>Adler Apotheke</em>, where the author Theodor Fontane worked from 1841 to 1842 as a chemist\''s assistant.On the western side of the Marktplatz, you\''ll see Barthels Hof (1523), Leipzig\''s oldest commercial building and the first structure in the city to be built in the Renaissance style. Goethe was overwhelmed by the \"spacious rooms\" which where reminiscent of the country\''s \"great castles\". In the nearby <em>Zum Arabischen Coffe Baum</em> Museum and Café, visitors can enjoy a \"Schälchen Heeßen\" (as the locals affectionately refer to their coffee) in one of the oldest coffee shops on the continent. The <em>Messehaus am Markt</em> was home to the world\''s first underground trade fair - a 5,000-square-meter (53,820-square-foot) complex where books, watches and hunting instruments were exchanged.Behind the Altes Rathaus is the <em>Alte Handelsbörse</em> on Naschmarkt, where a bronze statue stands in memory of J.W. Goethe, who studied here between 1765 and 1768. A few steps away in the magnificent <em>Mädler Passage</em>, visitors can wine and dine in Auerbachs Keller, which was featured in Goethe\''s classic work, <em>Faust</em>.Leipzig is blessed with dozens of historic buildings which are best explored on a stroll through the city. Fine examples include the impressive baroque buildings on Katharinenstraße, churches such as Thomaskirche and Nikolaikirche, or the <em>Alte Waage</em>, where imported goods used to be weighed and taxed.It\''s also worth popping into the University of Leipzig for a glimpse of the place where many a famous Germans studied. Known by locals as the \"steep tooth\" or the \"wisdom tooth\", the main building is 34 floors high and towers over the city.For those interested in all things cultural, the Neues Gewandhaus - home to the world-famous Gewandhausorchester—shouldn\''t be missed. Other cultural landmarks include the Opera House, the <em>Moritzbastei</em>, the Johann Sebastian Bach Museum, the Egyptian Museum and the Museum of Natural History.Yet perhaps the best thing about Leipzig is the pulsating multicultural atmosphere that permeates its city center, day and night. In summertime, every street seems to metamorphose into an outdoor café or beer garden. And the 3.5-kilometer-long (2-mile-long) promenade which encircles the old city offers both locals and tourists the chance to relax and take a breather.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The South</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city\''s most imposing structure is without a doubt the Völkerschlachtdenkmal, located in the district of Probstheida. Inaugurated on 18th October 1913 to mark the 100th anniversary of the <em>Völkerschlacht</em> (The \"Battle of the Nations\"), the memorial remains controversial to this day. The 90-meter-high (295-foot-high) viewing platform offers a breathtaking views over Leipzig.The National Library and the National Museum of Books and Writing are also located in the southern part of Leipzig. The latter boasts an impressive collection of priceless scripts and patents. Located not far away is the <em>Alte Messe</em> - Leipzig\''s old exhibition center with 22 halls and 27 pavilions - which is living testimony of the crucial role that trade fairs and exhibitions have played in the history and development of the city. Numerous film and TV companies are also based in this area, cementing Leipzig\''s reputation as a media hotspot.The district of Lößnig is worth a visit for its unique architectural layout. The so-called <em>Rundling</em> is a fine example of 1930s residential housing. With all its buildings arranged in a circle around a central area (Siegfriedplatz), the Rundling offered modern and affordable housing for large, working-class families.Heading further south, visitors will come across Agra-Park, a beautiful park complete with landscaped gardens, a botanical estate and cultural monuments.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The East</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The eastern part of the city is home to the <em>Bayrische Bahnhof</em>, the world\''s oldest railway terminal which opened in 1844 to serve the line between Bavaria and Saxony.Leipzig is also famous as being home to some of the world\''s largest and most prestigious publishers. Although the old publishers\'' quarter was destroyed during the Second World War, certain street names (such as Reclamstraße, Inselstraße and Baedekerstraße) still bare witness to the district\''s literary roots. The <em>Messehaus Bugra</em>, an important centre of the German book trade, can also be found here.Heading a bit further east, visitors will come across the lovely Botanical Gardens, which have been growing countless varieties of orchids, palms and other exotic plants since 1542.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The North</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Schillerhaus is a small, half-timbered farmhouse located in the district of Gohlis, and was home to the writer Friedrich Schiller in 1785. This is the place where Schiller wrote his legendary \"Ode to Joy\" as well as parts of \"Don Carlos.\" The house has now been turned into a museum. Gohliser Schlößchen, a magnificent baroque and rococo palace, is a great place to enjoy a touch of chamber music or to savour a bit of fine Saxon cuisine.The Brodyer Synagogue was founded in 1904 and was the only one of Leipzig\''s synagogues to survive the Nazi purges on <em>Kristallnacht</em> in 1938. It was reopened on 22 May 1993.Visitors can admire the lions, hyenas and Siberian tigers in Leipzig Zoo, one of Germany\''s oldest zoos (1877). Those who want to avoid paying the entrance fee could wander along the Rosenthal at the back of the zoo and take a look in through the large pane glass windows.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The West</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As well as containing dozens of business parks and factories, the districts of Plagwitz and Lindenau also contain the Red Bull Arena, one of Germany\''s largest open-air stadiums, and the Sport Museum, a fantastic sports exhibition with a particular focus on gymnastics. Visitors could also take a relaxing walk through Clara Zetkin Park, full of beautiful flower beds, fish-ponds and lawns.

The Mariinskii Theatre is the premier home of this world-renowned troupe, and a largely coveted experience in the city. Formerly known as the Kirov, this theater is the jewel in the crown of the city\''s cultural life. Luxuriously outfitted, it hosts several major premieres every year and affluent tourists flock to catch showings of major Russian pieces such as <em>Swan Lake</em> and <em>The Nutcracker,</em> as well as performances of major works from the European canon. For opera and ballet, your next best bet is the Mikhailovsky Theatre on Arts Square, not quite as luxurious or prestigious as the Mariinskii but still worth a visit. Elsewhere, the Grand Concert Hall Oktyabrsky hosts performances in its large Soviet-era hall.Symphony concerts can be attended at a variety of excellent venues, among them the Grand Hall of the Saint Petersburg Academic Philharmonic Society and the Glinka Kapella just off Palace Square. Smaller venues such as the Home Theatre at the Yusupov Palace, and the Hermitage Theatre (both former private theaters for the Imperial elite) offer more intimate performances. The renovated Smolnyi Cathedral also hosts classical music performances.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">St Petersburg has a grand dramatic tradition and takes the theatrical arts very seriously. There are a huge variety of venues to visit, offering a wide range of performances. The premier venue is the Bolshoi Drama Theatre on the Fontanka canal, whose repertoire takes in a broad range of Russian material plus the occasional interpretation of Western works. Located in a beautiful Rossi-designed auditorium, the Alexandrinsky Theatre draws on the full canon of Russian and Soviet works. The Maly Drama Theatre is another popular option, as is the Komissarzhevskaia Theatre just off Palace Square. Both show mainly Russian works, the latter with a much more classical bent.The Baltiiskii Dom hosts a number of the city\''s more progressive and innovative drama groups as well as a number of rock and pop concerts.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Clubs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The club scene in St Petersburg is a lively affair. From wildly popular clubbing destinations, to more discreet underground clubs, there is a plethora of options to suit the tastes of any clubber. For techno/dance music you can head for the underground chill of Griboedov or the smaller hangout Fish Fabrique. For live music your best bets are Liverpool or Money Honey. The city has a smattering of LGBT-friendly venues, of which the popular ones include Central Station and the Blue Oyster Bar.Jazz has a long history of popularity here and the city boasts both a string of well-known bands and a devoted and knowledgeable following. There are numerous venues: the Jazz Philharmonic Hall is something of an establishment and charges the highest prices. JFC Jazz Club is a small and nearly always packed venue notable for the enthusiasm of its crowd and the variety of music played: dixieland, Latin jazz, acid jazz - it\''s all here. There\''s also the seemingly underground Jimi Hendrix Blues Club, which caters to fans of blues music as well as straight jazz, plus the Hat Bar, a smaller venue that hosts big names.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Saint Petersburg\''s sprawling neighborhoods are home to a host of museums that feature deeply fascinating exhibits and artifacts. Gaze longingly at impressive art collections and works from both Russia and the world over, at revered institutions like the State Hermitage Museum and the Russian Museum. Watch some of Russia\''s most prized handicraft items and the legacy of the nation\''s royal jewelers at the gorgeous Fabergé Museum. Or admire the astonishing literary heritage of one of Russia\''s most compelling writers who penned classics like <em>The Brothers Karamazov </em>and <em>The Double </em>at the Dostoevsky Museum, housed within the former apartment of the author. Other prominent museums of military, political and historical value include the Military-Historical Museum of Artillery and the State Museum of Political History of Russia.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1173,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Central</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nevskii Prospekt is a grand-scale thoroughfare cutting right through the heart of the city. The rough triangle (to the north of Nevskii) formed by the street\''s central stretch, the Fontanka canal and the Neva is crammed full of St. Petersburg\''s main cultural attractions and a good number of its restaurants and places of entertainment. There\''s the Winter Palace and Palace Square, the Saviour on Spilled Blood Cathedral and Museum, and the Russian Museum. On the south side of Nevskii Prospekt stands the impressive semi-circular and columned Kazan Cathedral and further along you will find the central department store Gostinyi Dvor which is not far from the plush Grand Hotel Europe.This is the touristic, commercial and cultural heart of the city where visitors are guaranteed to spend a large chunk of their time. Nevskii itself is buzzing at all hours, but traffic (both human and vehicular) can be escaped by venturing to the peaceful Summer Gardens which are located north of the triangle.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Vasilievskii Island</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This large chunk of land lies to the northwest of the center, dividing the river Neva into the Greater and Lesser Nevas. Although the island is now primarily a sleepy residential district, it played a major role in the city\''s early history.Peter the Great originally intended Vasilevskii to be the city\''s center and therefore encouraged newly-arrived nobles and merchants to set themselves up there. His plans were never realized—problems with the construction of a canal network and the logistical nightmare of locating a city center on a sometimes inaccessible island encouraged the rise of Nevksii Prospekt as the alternative hub of the city. Nonetheless, testimony to the former importance of the island lies in the cluster of museums and buildings on the eastern side—the pre-revolutionary stock exchange building (now home to a Naval Museum) still stands here, along with Peter\''s macabre Kunstkammer museum and a little further on, St. Petersburg State University—the <em>alma mater</em> of President Putin. Beyond this there isn\''t a lot to see or do on Vasilievskii, although if you want a look at some awe-inspiring Soviet architecture you could do a lot worse than the vast residential building stretching westwards from Primorskaia metro. Also nearby is the hulking mass of the Swedish-built Pribaltiiskaia hotel which stands atop an extensive open area of concrete looking out onto the Gulf of Finland.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Petrograd Side & the Kirov Islands</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When Peter the Great first concocted his grand plan for a capital city on the Gulf of Finland, construction began on the Peter and Paul Fortress, located on the northern shores of the Neva. Although Nevskii Prospekt may constitute the heart of modern-day St. Petersburg, the city\''s origins actually lie on the other side of the river. The area to the north of the fortress is known as the Petrograd side. After the construction of Trinity Bridge, the area experienced something of a housing boom, contributing to its essentially residential nature. That said, it\''s not without interest. For a start, there\''s the Museum of Political History and the \"ship that launched the revolution\"—the Aurora—which is moored just around the embankment from the fortress. The Petrograd side was home to a number of notables (including Shostakovich, Lenin and Pavlov), each of whom have respective apartment museums situated here.The islands—Krestovskii, Kamennyi and Yelagin—are favorite winding-down spots for Petersburgers tired of the hectic city life to the south. Lurking at the western end of Krestovskii Island is the huge Krestovsky Stadium, also known as the Saint Petersburg Stadium.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South & West of Nevskii</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The area south and west of Nevskii (again, the area of land enclosed by the Neva, Nevskii and this time the southern stretch of the Fontanka canal) is also home to many tourist delights which are obviously less concentrated here than in the heart of the city. The tone of the area can change fairly dramatically: Sennaia Ploshchad is about 15 minutes by foot from the imperial St. Isaac\''s Square, but in comparison to the soaring grandeur of St Isaac\''s Cathedral or the elegance of its neighbor the Astoria hotel, it\''s a dingy vision of haphazard kiosks. However, much of the area is residential and fairly sleepy. Behind Gostinyi Dvor stands Apraksin Dvor—a complex of market stalls, smaller stores and cafés. At the northern end stands the Admiralty and the Bronze Horseman—two great symbols of the city—while deeper inside the territory stands the world-famous Mariinskii Theatre, the city\''s premiere cultural venue.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beyond the Fontanka</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This incorporates a huge area, including the eastern end of Nevskii as well as the Liteinyi, Vladimirskaia and Smolnyi regions. Beyond the Fontanka, Nevskii itself becomes more solidly commercial, although a glance above shop level reveals an impressive mish-mash of architectural styles. Vladimirskaia—to the south—is a bustling hub of activity, its main thoroughfares being important shopping areas. The area is also dotted with museums such as the Dostoevsky Museum.To the north, Liteinyi Prospekt and the area around Chernyshevskaia metro is a little quieter and more restrained. Maybe there\''s a reason for this—at the end of the street lie the former offices of the St. Petersburg KGB. It\''s very much a residential/commercial district, but there are nonetheless a few cultural attractions to be found here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Country Estates</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city itself isn\''t exactly lacking in extravagant monuments from the Imperial age, but if you want a glimpse of just how extravagant Russia\''s pre-Communist rulers really were, you\''ll need to jump on a suburban train and visit at least one of the Tsarist country residences. Though nearly all the palaces were sacked by the Germans during their World War II invasion, the palaces have been well-restored to their former glory. For sheer bombastic opulence, visit Peterhof—built to order by Peter the Great as a riotously over-the-top testimony to Russia\''s victory over Sweden. The huge Catherine Palace at Tsarskoe Selo is also grand, while the other estates—Pavlovsk, Oranienbaum (also known as Lomonosov) and Gatchina—are not quite as ostentatious but are still redolent of Imperial grandeur.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Museo de Arte de Lima, situated in the center of Lima, was the city\''s first museum of art and houses Peruvian art spanning more than 3,000 years, from the pre-Inca cultures to contemporary art.  The Museo de la Nación has a permanent collection, which covers all of Peru\''s archaeological and ethnographic regions and in addition, a replica of the royal tombs of the Señor de Sipán. The largest private collection of Mochicha art in the world is to be found in the Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera along with the famous erotic <em>huacos</em> (ceramic relics). Visit the Museo Amano to admire the wonderful collection of pre-Hispanic textile arts. The Pedro de Osma Museum is a museum housed in an old mansion and contains pieces of art in every textile imaginable, even metal and glass. This museum not only has local artists from Peru, but art from throughout the world. To witness a piece of history about the Spanish Inquisition, visit the Museo de la Inquisición, where you can venture below to the dungeons and see all of the torture instruments that the conquistadors used against infidels.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lima has an interesting stable of artists and every two years the Bienal de Arte is held when various galleries and large buildings in the center of Lima open to the general public with exhibitions of works by Peruvian and foreign artists.  The most popular galleries include the Galería de la Municipalidad de Miraflores and Galería Forum, which can both be found in Miraflores. In the district of Barranco you can find the Lucía de la Puente gallery and in San Isidro there are always interesting exhibitions in the Galería Cecilia González and in the Centro Cultural de la Universidad Católica.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Folk & Salsa Clubs (Peñas & Salsódromos)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Peru is very rich culturally, in dance, music and tradition. <em>Las Peñas</em> are folk clubs to gather together to the rhythms of <em>Criolla</em>, a traditional music form. Lima has several clubs such as the well-known Sachún, and El Eslabón in San Borja, where they also stage folkloric ballets like <em>Así es Mi Perú</em> (That\''s My Peru).   The <em>Peña folklórica</em> held at Brisas del Titicaca affords unforgettable performances of Andean song and dance—especially from the Puna district. The lively ambiance invites all to join in along with the cast of professional performers. It is without a doubt the best spot in town of its kind.   A stop over at a <em>salsódromo</em> (salsa club)in order to be able to dance salsa, meringues, or any other variation of Afro-Latin-Caribbean music is a must. These venues specialize in these musical styles and normally showcase numerous live bands, which, in most cases, play until the early hours. One of the best-known <em>salsadromes</em> is Del Carajo! in Barranco.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bars, Clubs & Discotheques</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Miraflores, with its colorful vibe, is a great choice to have a good time. However, beware of several nightclubs parading as <em>bordellos </em>or brothels, and it is best to stick with places you know before sauntering inside.  The Cocodrilo Verde, an incredible bar that hosts jazz and occasional <em>bossa nova</em> performances in its dimly-lit space, is a favorite with the Miraflores crowd, as is Aura. Valetodo Downtown is a hit with the city\''s gay crowd, while El Dragón in Barranco is a fabulous dance spot that the young and the restless flock to. La Noche and El Tayta in the same neighborhood are also worth exploring. If unwinding with a drink is on the agenda, then you will be better of visiting pisco-serving bars like Ayahuasca, Bar Maury and Barra 55.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema & Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For cinema-lovers, there are a huge number of multiplex cinemas, which have sprung up all over the city. They mostly show Hollywood blockbusters. For those who prefer less mainstream, independent films, there are Filmoteca de Lima, which is in the Museo de Arte de Lima, and the cinema at the Centro Cultural de la Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú in San Isidro.   Lima is not really known for its theater, but from time to time there are a few interesting plays and shows. The City of Lima and the Instituto Cultural Peruano Norteamericano are two institutions that organize annually very good international festivals, in which you can enjoy the best dance companies and local theater, as well as renowned groups from other parts of the world.  For those who enjoy light comedy, one of the oldest and best-known comedy theaters is the Teatro Marsano in Miraflores. The theater at the Centro Cultural de la Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú stages a varied repertoire of works from a diverse range of dance and theater companies, usually of a very high standard.   The in-house theater of Teatro de la Casa Yuyachkani is one of the most alternative theater spaces in Lima, where the Yuyachkani theater group continuously presents shows which usually mix theater with dance and movement.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

 (1193,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Barranco</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The well-known district of Barranco is known for its leisurely strolls, bars and <em>bohemia</em>. Located, along the Chorrillos, at the southern tip of Lima Bay along the shoreline and the Avenida Bolognesi, it is the dividing line between the two different faces of this city: the historic residential area and the other a bustling working class area.The historic district lies between Avenida Bolognesi and the <em>malecón</em> (quayside), where mid-19th century streets, parks and gardens can be enjoyed. Follow the seafront southward to the beaches lining the coast, to arrive at the Bajada de los Baños, a romantic location to savor typical local dishes, or enjoy a drink while gazing out over a beautiful ocean view.The Parque Municipal is found just past this area. Retaining the aristocratic airs of yesteryear, most of Barranco\''s cafes, restaurants, bars and pubs—housed in mansions—are clustered around this plaza. Like the traditional Bar Juanito, most attract the local bohemians, artists and other patrons who come to Barranco for a good time.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Miraflores</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Miraflores is without a doubt the area with the most commercial activity, drawing throngs of tourists on a daily basis. Filled to the brim with shopping malls, cinemas, hotels, it boasts the highest concentration of cafes in Lima. Located along a sloping shoreline, its surrounding promenade leads to the beaches and parks along with the modern shopping complex, Larcomar.The district is also well-known for its nightlife and shopping. Grab a pizza along the street named after this dish, the <em>Calle de las Pizzas</em> or take to the floor in one of the modern dance clubs, with the latest techno and trance sounds. A number of casinos, boutiques, parks and luxury hotels are also located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">City Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The streets, plazas and alleyways of the historical center of Lima have a myriad of cafes and restaurants sewn into its sinuous stretch. There are also colonial and republican buildings, along the centuries-old streets, house museums, beautiful, cavernous Renaissance and Baroque churches, old mansions of particular historic interest like Casa de Osambela Oquendo and Palacio de Torre Tagle; as well as landmarks such as the Iglesia de San Francisco and the Lima Art Museum, close to the Justice Palace.From the expansive Plaza de Armas, you have the choice of wandering along one side of the Government Palace toward the charming little plaza in front of Iglesia de San Francisco. On the other side of the palace the alleyway known as Alameda Chabuca Granda is ideal for taste testing typical local sweets and if luck has it, catching a live concert of traditional Criollo or Afro-Peruvian music. There are a host of traditional old bars which serve food and drink in an atmosphere reminiscent of the days of yore, such as Cordano and the Queirolo, which makes its own wine.Lima\''s city nightlife is varied. For drinks, try the <em>choperías</em> (beer pubs) such as Piano Bar Munich on the Jirón de la Unión street. Stroll the alleyways of Santa Rosa and Los Escribanos and stop for a coffee, ice cream, snack, or browse through a bookshop. Though there are a few night-clubs in this area, it is not the safest of places to venture after dark.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">San Isidro</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Originally, this district was an upper class residential area where the scenic neighborhoods are arranged around attractive parks of large, stately trees, such as Olivar de San Isidro, and El Club de Golf. The ruins of Huaca Huallamarca is also one of its main landmarks. Today the area is best described as a shopping and financial district. As many as 38 embassies and consulates grace the streets of this district, along with banking institutions, synagogues, churches, and temples. The Ovalo Gutiérrez district is also alive with shops, cafes, and other activities.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">La Victoria</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hemmed by Lima\''s central district on the west, La Victoria is considered one of the city\''s most populated districts in the city. It stretches from Avenida Grau to Avenida Mexico. The heart of this district is teeming with local stores, while the Pedro Canepa Park mall is the only commercial mall here. Strewn across the district are several green spaces and a few colleges as well. The suburbs of Balconcillo and Santa Catalina are largely residential, with the latter being the more affluent of the two. The Estadio Alejandro Villanueva, home ground of the Peruvian Alianza Lima team, is located here. Each November, the streets of La Victoria come alive with the procession of the Lord of Miracles, where a revered 17th Century painting of Jesus Christ is paraded, and a feast also marks the celebration.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outlying District of Callao</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This airport district has an important maritime port that serves the entire country. The Callao Port was established in 1537 in order transport riches from the new world back to Spain. Don\''t forget to visit the Fortaleza del Real Felipe which is located in the port and the natural beauty of the Isla San Lorenzo where you can sunbathe, explore aquatic caves and enjoy some delicious seafood. Though Callao is considered part of the greater Lima metropolitan area, Callao is administratively separate from the capital and more than 600,000 people reside in the district.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The proliferation of hip, trendy, and increasingly famous young British artists merely adds to the wealth of the more traditional art that London has to offer. The National Gallery and the Tate Britain are mainstays. The Courtauld Institute of Art, the National Portrait Gallery, the Barbican Centre and <span>Serpentine Galleries</span> are lesser known but just as good. For a modern challenge, check out the Saatchi  Gallery and of course, the Bankside behemoth that is the Tate Modern.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most of the city\''s mainstream cinematic venues are centered in Leicester Square. A cheap option is the Prince Charles cinema. For a real \''art-House\'' experience, try the Gate Cinema, the ICA Bar And Cafe, or the BFI Southbank. There are also frequent film festivals like the popular Latin American Film Festival. The BFI London IMAX at Waterloo offers a state-of-the-art screen featuring IMAX films — a real viewing experience.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Comedy</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\''re looking for a laugh, you can\''t beat what London has to offer. The most famous club is The Comedy Store, but the Camden Comedy Club and Up the Creek are also worth checking out. Besides these regular venues, there are comedy festivals and comedy nights held around the city regularly. Of these, the Live At The Chapel in Union Chapel, Islington hosts some of the biggest names in comedy entertainment.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dance</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Performances tend to center on Sadler\''s Wells theater, where contemporary dance, ballet and opera can all be found. The Royal Festival Hall and The Barbican Centre also house excellent productions, and the ICA is a Mecca for experimental dance.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you want to check out some art, not to worry-museums here are abundant and of excellent quality. The Science Museum, the Natural History Museum and the V&A South Kensington are all located in South Kensington. The Imperial War Museum is also worth a look — it isn\''t just for tank-spotters. Naturally, there is an absolute myriad of smaller, often fascinating museums throughout London: Pollock\''s Toy Museum & Toy Shop, the Design Museum and the Horniman Museum and Gardens are just a few examples.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Classical and Opera</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Classical music has three main homes in London: the Barbican Centre, the South Bank Centre and the Royal Albert Hall. The London Symphony Orchestra is resident at the Barbican and the Philharmonia is based at the Royal Festival Hall, which is part of the South Bank Center. The Royal Albert Hall plays host annually to the BBC Proms — a fabulous summer-long festival of classical music. Opera resonates from two sources — the English National Opera and the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rock/Pop/Jazz</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This sort of music is everywhere in London. Camden is always bubbling with indie vibes. The Brixton Academy is an excellent place to see bands on the verge of stadium-sized fame, and Borderline is good for bands on the verge of Brixton Academy-sized fame. For jazz, you can\''t beat the legendary Ronnie Scott\''s.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightclubs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">These places come in as many flavors, shapes, sizes and styles as there are people to fill them. The better-known clubs tend to be around the Leicester Square/Charing Cross Road area. Legendary nightclub Fabric brings together some of the best DJs on the international circuit with a loyal EDM-loving fan base. Shoreditch\''s XOYO is where those with a love for live music will find their niche, while rooftop revels can be had at Queen of Hoxton. For alternative sounds in a student-led space, Corsica Studios is a great choice while more mainstream sounds can be found at the ultra-popular Ministry of Sound.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater in London can be separated into three parts. One section encompasses the sophisticated end of the theater spectrum - plenty of Shakespeare and complex modern plays. There are three repertory companies based in their own theaters - the Royal National Theatre, the Royal Court Theatre and Shakespeare\''s Globe. Then there are the \"West End\" shows (this refers to big productions, not to their location). Many of the West End shows can be found on or around Shaftesbury Avenue and Charing Cross Road. There are many big production musicals and plays that make for a great evening out.The rest are generally known as Off West End. One of the best exponents of this sector is the Almeida where film stars Ralph Fiennes and Nicole Kidman have trod the boards. The Lyric Theatre and the Young Vic also regularly host high-quality productions.London features a number of tour companies and discount booking businesses. Theatre Breaks offers discounted rates to some of the most popular attractions and events.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A global shopping destination, London has it all.

The covered arches of Covent Garden Market are home to a variety of local arts and crafts, while the surrounding alleys have some of the best shoe stores in the city!

Modern structures like Lloyd\''s Building outnumber the more ancient edifices of the Bank of England and the Old Bailey. The City embraces the sacred in St. Paul\''s Cathedral and the everyday in Spitalfields Market and Leadenhall Market. Blackfriars Bridge was the site of the infamous 1982 murder of the Italian banker Roberto Calvi.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Westminster & St James\''s</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The British Empire was ruled from Whitehall, but now it only serves the United Kingdom. Not surprisingly, civil servants and politicians abound in the vicinity. Big Ben reliably strikes out the hour, loud enough to wake the old kings and queens from their tombs in Westminster Abbey.

Many Londoners congregate here for Chinese New Year Celebrations, a very colorful, fun-filled spectacle.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Battersea & Clapham</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Home to hoards of trendy young things, this is the place to go for fun and funky bars and restaurants outside of central London.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bayswater & Paddington</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Famous for its train station and the Peruvian bear named after it (the marmalade sandwich-munching Paddington Bear), this area is a good bet for affordable accommodation that\''s close to the tranquility of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bloomsbury, Euston & Fitzrovia</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bloomsbury is London\''s literary capital and a walking tour is the best way to discover the haunts of the city\''s verbose geniuses.

The wonderful cultural diversity is visible in the bustling, popular market.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Camden</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Crowded streets spill over with shoppers and people-watchers who flock from far and wide to relax, rather than haggle, at the Camden Market. However, good restaurants like Gilgamesh, clubs like Monto Water Rats and a top comedy venue make Camden much more than a great grocery shopping stop.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chelsea & Fulham</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chic boutiques, expensive restaurants, aristocrats and models in slick sports cars haunt Brompton Cross, King\''s Road and Kensington High Street. It\''s always a pleasure to cruise across the delightful Albert Bridge at night when it\''s all lit up.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Clerkenwell & Shoreditch</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This trendy area is flush with hip, sofa-laden hangouts, swanky restaurants and sleek galleries. Most of the action revolves around Hoxton Square, but East London is always booming due to its proximity to the city. Once favored only by struggling artists on the cutting edge, it\''s now a new media mecca with artists and savvy tech upstarts providing a vibrant mix.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Docklands & Wapping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Heavily bombed during World War II, this area has become the incarnation of 1980s prosperity. Canary Wharf Tower dominates the skyline and the Canary Wharf area is one of the capital\''s greatest economic powerhouses. The Tower of London was a 16th-century prison where some of Henry VIII\''s unlucky wives were beheaded. No longer so unfriendly, visitors are able to view the fabulous Crown Jewels on the premises. Afterwards, stroll outside and take in the stunning Tower Bridge.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ealing</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is home to a beautiful active Benedictine Abbey, a large Polish community and the famous Ealing Studios where films like <em>Shaun of the Dead</em> and <em>Doctor Who</em> have been produced.

A popular place for theater, you can choose from the cozy Lyric Hammersmith, the high-quality London Apollo or the fringe-style Bush Theatre.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hampstead</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This neighborhood is a leafy suburbia with a charming village ambiance.

From the eternal sunshine and Hollywood glitz to all the small communities with their own distinct cultural personalities, this City of Angels will forever be many things to many people.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Getty Villa is a breathtaking architectural work that\''s stunning even before you even see the collections inside.

Although it bears no resemblance to the former hit television show, Melrose is the best sidewalk spectacle. Crammed full of sidewalk cafés, bars, coffeehouses and boutiques, the street is always full of activity and unusual characters. If true Hollywood stars and über-glam shopping are what you are looking for, Rodeo Drive is the ultimate destination.

 (1242,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown and the Arts District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While not exactly in the center of town geographically due to the sprawling nature of the city, Downtown Los Angeles is still teeming with activity. There are cultural hotbeds like Olvera Street and Chinatown that are just minutes away from Los Angeles landmarks like the Walt Disney Concert Hall, home of the LA Philharmonic. And if you have a hankering for more art and culture while Downtown, the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) is a definite must-see.The Downtown Arts District has over the years seen creative rejuvenation, and the sheer concentration of galleries and alternative art spaces speaks to this growth. Explore the neighborhood on foot to discover up-and-coming artists, indie boutiques, craft eateries, and more! For art enthusiasts, the Downtown Art Walk, held every second Thursday of the month is highly recommended.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hollywood</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The big sign just about says it all - Hollywood is glitz, glamor, and unavoidable. The center of things is, without a doubt, Hollywood Boulevard, the location of world-famous tourist spots including TCL Chinese Theater, the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and the Dolby Theatre. The Miracle Mile/Hancock Park area is another of L.A.\''s historic neighborhoods. Here you will find Wilshire Boulevard\''s Museum Row. The museums are contained within Hancock Park, a small but peaceful oasis in the center of hectic urban activity. To venture into the distant past, stop by the La Brea Tar Pits; and to immerse yourself in a famous museum, the LACMA: Los Angeles County Museum of Art is a popular attraction on Miracle Mile. Ritzy West Hollywood is home to one of the city\''s most famous (or infamous) attractions - the Sunset Strip. Here you\''ll find most of the city\''s hippest clubs frequented by up-and-coming actors and socialites, as well as some of the city\''s finest hotels and shopping, including the upscale Melrose Avenue Shopping District. West Hollywood is also the center of the city\''s gay and lesbian community, and it puts on one of the flashiest and most exhilarating annual Halloween parades in the state.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beverly Hills & the Westside</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This world-famous city with its world-famous zip code is synonymous with wealth, status, and celebrity. The understated elegance and grace of the residential neighborhoods are balanced out by Rodeo Drive, which offers some of the finest - and most expensive - shopping in the world. For some of the freshest locally-grown Californian produce, the Farmers\'' Market held every Sunday is a local favorite and a must for all gourmets.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Santa Monica & Bay Cities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Back in the heyday of Route 66, Santa Monica was the end of the line. Today, this beachfront community offers the best in entertainment for all ages on its famous Santa Monica Pier. You can enjoy some carnival-style food and games or take a ride on the Ferris wheel for a breathtaking view of the city and shoreline. When you\''re ready for some shopping, the active Third Street Promenade has a diverse directory of stores and eateries. The motto of the coastal community of Malibu is \"27 miles of scenic beauty\" - and that just about describes it best. The main attraction here is the drive along the Pacific Coast Highway, which takes you past beach after beach on one side of the road and million-dollar hilltop estates on the other. Make sure you have sunscreen and your camera handy. Even at night, the stars just seem brighter. Venice, just south of Santa Monica, is the city\''s home to all things eclectic and many things downright bizarre. This small, artsy beach town offers one of the greatest collections of cafés, bars, galleries, antiques and one-of-a-kind shops around. Weekend afternoons on the boardwalk are definitely a memorable experience for any visitor to the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">San Fernando Valley</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the other side of the Hollywood Hills sits \"The Valley,\" as it\''s known by locals. It features a seemingly endless sea of suburban cul-de-sacs, strip malls, funky shops and restaurants. Hollywood makes its presence known in the cities of Burbank and Universal City, which are home to Warner Bros. Studio and Universal Studios. To experience the diversity that makes this area unique, visit the Wat Thai Temple, or get swept up in the region\''s natural beauty at the Lake Balboa Park. Stroll around NoHo and drop in for a show at one of the theaters or laugh out loud at a comedy club like the Acme Comedy Club.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Central & Compton</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although the South Central neighborhood of Crenshaw gained worldwide publicity as the center of the infamous 1992 riots, this area is rich in history and culture. South Central is also home to famous Los Angeles landmarks such as the Watts Towers, the historic Shrine Auditorium, and Exposition Park. Within the famed Exposition Park is the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, the California Science Center, and the IMAX California Science Center. It has also long been a place of culture and diversity, as evidenced by the African American Cultural Center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Long Beach & the South Bay</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Long Beach is a fairly large city in its own right and is a neighbor to the well-known district of Orange County. Aside from a plethora of shopping and dining options, this beach community is perhaps best known for the Queen Mary, a Titanic-esque ocean liner now permanently docked here and open for tours. They also have many outdoor activities for tourists to take advantage of, as well as museums and beaches that all can enjoy. Kids will especially love the Aquarium of the Pacific, the world\''s largest aquarium, located in Rainbow Harbor. The South Bay is made up of smaller beach towns and quiet neighborhoods such as Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach, and Manhattan Beach.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pasadena & Points East</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pasadena is one of the most prominent communities in the entire state of California. Old Town Pasadena provides one of the greatest clusters of bars, shops, cafés and restaurants in the entire L.A. area. The city is also known for the Norton Simon Museum - the largest collection of art owned by one man -and the Rose Bowl. Every New Year\''s Day, this not-so-sleepy town becomes the focus of the entire world for the annual Tournament of Roses Parade. East L.A., as evidenced by its name, forms the eastern edge of the city and is a great example of a neighborhood rich in cultural expression.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">LAX & Inglewood</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">LAX is one of the largest airports in the United States when it comes to the sheer number of people passing through its hallways. The airport is the main feature of the otherwise sleepy, suburban neighborhood of Westchester. This pocket of quiet, tree-lined streets and neighborhood schools and churches is a refreshing oasis in an often-frenetic city. Inglewood features a wide variety of restaurants, music and sports venues. Here you will find The Forum, an entertainment hot spot.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The best known and most popular are the Musée de la Civilisation Gallo-Romaine, which explains in depth the history of ancient Gaul under the Roman Empire, the Musée des Confluences, the Musée des Beaux-Arts, a name recognized worldwide, the Institut Lumière, which focuses on the Lumière brothers and their great invention, and finally, the Musée des Miniatures, which provides a birds\''-eye view of our world, reproduced in miniature. Art lovers will find solace in the three-storied splendor of the Musée d\''art Contemporain, a modern space brimming with avante-garde installations and video art. The Galerie Catherine Mainguy, another artistic fixture on Lyon\''s streets since 2008, features excellent exhibitions while Galerie Clémouchka, nestled in La Croix-Rousse, is a bright, light-filled space exhibiting a riveting array of modern art.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Film</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lyon is certainly not lacking movie theaters, offering new releases, old classics, and even small, low budget movies. The most popular movie theaters in Lyon, frequented for their quality and reasonable prices are the UGC Lyon Part Dieu 4 and the Ciné Cité. These cinemas show new releases for the most part, in very comfortably equipped screening rooms. Lesser known or small-budget movies and old cult classics can be found in the local cinemas, like the Cinéma Opéra, the Cinéma Le Zola, as well as the UGC Astoria which shows both major motion pictures and small-budget films. You must also not miss a visit to the marvelous and historical Institut Lumière.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater & Dance</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are many stages for theater and dance performances in Lyon, which are usually well-appreciated and frequented by its cultured denizens. The best-known are the Théâtre National Populaire, the Maison de la Danse, the Théâtre des Célestins, and the Théâtre de la Croix-Rousse. Lyon is an excellent place both to discover new talent and admire established names, as many well-known troupes make this city a regular stop.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Classical auditory treats abound in Lyon, with busy concert schedules at the Auditorium Maurice Ravel and the Opéra de Lyon. The Opera hall is truly spectacular, the sound is remarkable, and the decor beautiful. A memorable evening is guaranteed, particularly on nights featuring masterpieces like the <em>Magic Flute</em>.  Those travelers who love nothing better than a peaceful evening accompanied by the soulful sounds of jazz and blues will have no trouble getting some satisfaction in Lyon. There are many music-themed bars which cater to this style: try the Hot Club or the Le Sirius to start out.  There are also many places where you can enjoy good rock music, like the Eden Rock Café, Le Triperie and Le Sonic. The groups who perform are good, and the number of skilled musicians in Lyon is surprisingly high.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightclubs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lyon by night is by no means Paris, but hosts quite an entertaining nightclub scene that has burgeoned in the last few years. There are excellent evenings to be had at atmospheric and wildly popular clubs like Terminal and Le Petit Salon, where a combination of electronic music, a massive dance floor and eons of youthful energy culminate into an unforgettable clubbing experience. Le Marché Gare, a dynamic concert venue that also doubles as a nightclub, hosts roaring crowds to the strains of eclectic music genres - from punk and disco, to hip-hop and rap. Of course there are also places for more intense partying or drinking. The rue Sainte Catherine is unbeatable for mythic nights, if not always the most pleasant. Bars line the street, creating an energetic buzz all night. Start at Ayers Rock and keep moving down the street for an intense evening. A host of varied bars and pubs follow each other from Saint-Jean to Vaise along the Saône riverside. Cruise through to find a fun-loving crowd.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lyon has something to offer most sports lovers, with the Gerland Stadium for the Olympique Lyonnais football club and the Astroballe for ASVEL Basket basketball team. It also has many other stadiums, gymnasiums, and sports cafes.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you must shop in Lyon, shop at its fabulous outdoor markets that sell what the city does best - food. You can find gastronomical delights galore at markets like St Antoine and La Croix Rouss, or be mesmerized by the stupendous array of shops that line the stunning halls of the Les Halles de Lyon Paul Bocuse gourmet mall. If you do stop eating or shopping for anything food related, waltz by the lanes of the Les Puces du Canal flea market, where you can find everything from vintage linen to small knick knacks. Or, head to the La Part-Dieu mall for all and sundry.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1252,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Vieux Lyon</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Vieux Lyon is without doubt the most famous and most visited area of the town, honored in 1998 with classification as a World Heritage Center by UNESCO. In addition to the Palais Episcopal Saint-Jean and the Cathédrale Saint Jean, visitors will find many townhouses which date from the middle ages and the Renaissance: the Maison du Soleil (Saint Georges quarter), the Auberge du Gouvernement, the Maison Thomassin, the Maison des Avocats, the famous Cour des Loges hotel, the Maison du Chamarier (Saint Jean quarter), and the Hôtel Paterin. From the Middle Ages the area was reserved for trade and fairs, as shown by the Loge du Change, which was once a bank and then became a Protestant place of worship. Fans of architecture will be delighted to pace the cobblestone alleyways and the traboules—these famous passages link alleyways together and through them you can explore the interior courtyards of the townhouses. Those fond of archeology will be interested in the remains of the primitive cathedral (fourth-eighth centuries) in the Jardin archéologique situated at the north side of the present day sanctuary. Old Lyon (Vieux Lyon) has an undeniable charm, with its boutiques, its <em>bouchons</em> (restaurants which specialize in the cuisine of Lyon), and the colors of the city which are slightly reminiscent of Italy.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fourvière</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Old Lyon is situated at the foot of the Fourvière hill. Fourvière represented the very heart of the old town, which explains the large number of Gallo-Roman remains jutting out from its slopes. The Museum of Gallo-Roman Civilization presents the history of Lugdunum. Today the hill is home to many ecclesiastical communities who have chosen to settle near the famous Basilique de Fourvière, whose imposing architecture looms above town. Don\''t miss the superb view from the Esplanade de Fourvière.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Presqu\''île</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Presqu\''île is the stretch of the land which spans from the Rhône and the <em>Saône</em> to the foot of the Croix-Rousse hill. This is the commercial center of Lyon with the Rue de la République and the Rue Victor Hugo which give out onto the Place Bellecour, a meeting place for many people of Lyon. Stylish shops are to be found around the Rue Edouard Herriot, the Rue Comte houses the majority of Lyon\''s antiques dealers, and the Rue Mercière boasts all styles of restaurants. Visitors should take a stroll down smaller streets in this area, rather than settle on the first appealing window display. Saint Martin d\''ainay, one of the rare Roman churches preserved in Lyon, is situated to the south of Presqu\''île, as well as the pleasantly surprising Musée des Tissus, housed in an 18th century townhouse.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Terreaux</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Terraux quarter takes its name from the old moat which protected the north of the town in the Middle Ages. Today it includes the neighborhood of the Place des Terreaux, redesigned by Daniel Buren in 1994. This quarter features many monuments like the highly successful Opéra de Lyon, which was renovated by Jean Nouvel, the Palais Saint Pierre which today houses the Musée des Beaux-Arts, and the Town Hall. The Rue Sainte Catherine which runs along the north of the Place des Terreaux is known for its many pubs.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Croix-Rousse</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Croix-Rousse is known as the former den of the silk workers, which Lyon was famous for until the nineteenth century. The buildings were constructed in the nineteenth century to house the large weaving looms invented by Joseph-Marie Jacquard. The density and shape of the buildings transformed the Croix Rousse into a maze scattered with passageways, which gave them their reputation—the traboules. The slopes of the hill are also home to many restaurants and bars, where all types of cuisine are to be found. The Croix-Rousse hill became the home of the artists, and the <em>Ecole des Beaux Arts</em> was built on it. By taking an alleyway you will undoubtedly find one of hill\''s special places like the Amphithéâtre gallo-romain where the first Lyonnais martyrs were sacrificed, or the Jardin des Chartreux which offers a superb view over the town.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Part-Dieu et Villeurbanne</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The left bank of the <em>Rhône</em> is to business what the right bank of the <em>Saône</em> is to tourism. The so-called pencil of the Part Dieu is surrounded by and essentially made up of offices. Those who travel by train know that the train station is an ideal pretext to go shopping in the huge shopping center of the Part-Dieu. This district may still turn out to be of interest to tourists, especially if one considers the contemporary architecture and especially the Cité des Gratte-Ciel complex. This complex is one of the first workers\'' housing developments of the 1920s, situated near the Hôtel de Ville de Villeurbanne which marks the architectural grandeur of the period.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Gerland et les Etats-Unis</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Gerland quarter, in the south of Lyon, is especially renowned for its football stadium, its pharmaceutical laboratories, its weekend traffic jams and its new university campus. The area is gradually coming to life after its industrial past, and this can be seen in the Halle Tony Garnier, the last vestige of the industrial estate built by the famous Lyonnais architect. Tony Garnier was also responsible for the contemporary design of the Gratte Ciel — a utopian estate in the quartier des Etats Unis. Fans of modern architecture should also visit the Musée Urbain Tony Garnier, which details the architect\''s ideas, and appreciate the murals which adorn the façade of the buildings. Near the American quarter do not miss the wonderful Mosquée de Lyon.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Quartier Tête d\''or</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The north of the left bank is thought of as the peaceful, residential area of the town, where old buildings stand beside chic boutiques. Here you can take a stroll in Lyon\''s only big public garden, Tête d\''or Park, which houses botanical gardens and the Jardin zoologique de la Tête d\''or. Not far from the park on the banks of the Rhône, there is an estate which brings together a cinema complex, the modern conference hall, and the unmissable Musée d\''art contemporain.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

After a night out at Joy Madrid, for example, it\''s a Madrid tradition to go for early morning fritters and hot chocolate next door at Chocolatería San Ginés. Other clubs worth visiting are Palacio de Gaviria and Kapital. The <em>Malasaña</em> district is full of bars and clubs and tends to attract the younger folk. It\''s easy to party all night in any of the places around the Plaza del 2 de Mayo. Black & White is one of the best-known gay discos in the city.Clubs like the Ocho y Medio and La Riviera are one of Madrid\''s oldest, while Fabrik and Nox are hip techno and electro clubs in the city. The Goya Social Club hosts a fantastic line-up of DJs, as does Sala Arena.  Apart from a pulsating club scene, Madrid\''s bar scene is also largely legendary. Gran Via and Chueca shine with a collective dazzle that emanates from the jumble of diverse bars that line their streets. From landmark bars like El Palentino and La Ardosa that serve fantastic tapas alongside libations, the vermouth-serving Casa Camacho and the craft beer and tapas specialist Pez Tortilla are also incredible local gems. Anyone who loves cocktails must visit Del Diego, and oenophiles should flock to the Vinoteca García de la Navarra.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Galleries & Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city is brimming with art galleries of every taste. For example, the Mad is Mad Gallery specializes in contemporary artworks, presenting the hottest new artists, as do others like the Mondo Galeria and Heinrich Ehrhardt Gallery. The tony Salamanca district and Alonso Martínez also contain a number of galleries.There are museums devoted to every subject from famous painters to famous motorcyclists. The three most important collections of art in Spain are all within walking distance of each other in what\''s known as Madrid\''s \"Golden Triangle.\" The Museo del Prado is the most famous and exhibits masterpieces from El Greco, Velázquez, and Goya. The Thyssen Bornemizsa shows Van Dyck, Van Gogh, Dégas, Dalí, Carpaccio, and Kandinsky. The Centro de Arte Reina Sofía specializes in contemporary Spanish art, such as Picasso\''s <em>Guernica</em> and works by Miró and Dalí. Pre-Columbian art collections grace the walls of the Museo de América, and Museo del Romanticismo is home to the works of Goethe and Lord Byron. The Sorolla Museum explores artistic roots closer to home, at former house of Spanish artist Joaquin Sorolla, which features his lifelong work.Besides art, Madrid is also teeming with a host of other museums like the Museum of Natural Sciences, the National Archaeological Museum, the CaixaForum Madrid, and the unique Museo del Traje.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinemas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The cinemas are concentrated along the Gran Vía east of the Plaza de España. Movies tend to be dubbed into Spanish so if you want to see them in the original language, make sure it specifies V.O. (<em>versión original</em>) in the listing.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dance</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lots of bars and clubs put on a traditional <em>tablao</em> where you can watch flamenco dancing in its different forms. Mainstream venues like the Teatro de la Zarzuela and the Centro Cultural de la Villa (under the waterfall in the center of the Plaza de Colón) host national and international companies performing ballet and contemporary dance. Although flamenco comes from the south of Spain, Madrid attracts many top acts. Try El Corral de la Morería, Casa Patas or Candela, or just wander through the gates of the Plaza Mayor until you hear something you like coming from within.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Live Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As for music, jazz aficionados can choose from a number of clubs in the Huertas district. Or for Rock/Indie music you can go to larger venues like La Riviera, which hosts many major international superstars.The lovely Teatro de la Zarzuela and the Teatro Real are good places to hear classical music and opera.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are dozens of \"mainstream\" theaters, often showing works by famous Spanish dramatists, many of whom have metro stops named after them (Quevedo, Tirso de Molina). The Nuevo Apolo, the Abadía and the Comedia are just a few. Or for way-out Spanish fringe try Sala Cuarta Pared. Be sure to check out Madrid\''s English-language what\''s-on guide for a listing of English productions.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Madrid\''s favorite sport, football, finds credence in La Liga football clubs like Real Madrid and its rival, Atlético Madrid, which play at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and Wanda Metropolitano Stadium respectively. Besides football, Spanish basketball and tennis is also enjoyed. Those interested in more traditional renditions of sports will love the action and drama that ensues at La Ventas, the largest <em>plaza de toros</em>, or bullring, in Spain. This spectacular Neo-Mudéjar plaza hosts bullfighting season between March and October.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Along the thoroughfare of Gran Via await some of the most diverse shopping experiences in the city. A gaggle of various pedestrianized streets such as Calle Preciados radiate from this arterial stretch, featuring an eclectic range of brands like H&M, Zara. Near Calle Toledo, streets and lanes boast of a more regional touch, and are home to several independent boutiques and shops. A staggering realm of retail is set along the streets that maze through the Barrio de Salamanca<em>, </em>prime among which are the shops on Calle Serrano and Calla Alcala. Madrid is also teeming with urbane malls that line its busy streets, from the ABC Serrano Shopping Center to the La Vaguada.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Expect to find wonderful 19th-century buildings, shops, cafés, bars, restaurants, and crowds at this busy central intersection. From here, head up Calle Mayor to Plaza de la Villa and the old historic district. Or you can take Calle Arenal and visit the Palacio Real (Royal Palace) and the Teatro Real (Royal Opera House). If you go up the Carrera de San Jerónimo, you\''ll come to the Prado Museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Castellana</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This long, tree-lined boulevard is the backbone of Madrid. It\''s so long that it even has three official names. Come here to relax, take a coffee break, or simply do some sightseeing. Starting from Atocha train station, wander up shady Paseo del Prado and take in two of Madrid\''s most famous art museums: the Prado and the Thyssen-Bornemisza. The area also features the Real Jardín Botánico (Royal Botanical Gardens), home of many exotic plants. Continue on until you reach Plaza de Cibeles and the grand Palacio de Telecomunicaciones (post office).Suddenly, the boulevard turns into the Paseo de Recoletos, a great place to take a stroll. Or, better still, stop at Café Gijón, where Spain\''s intellectuals hang out, for a <em>café con leche</em> (coffee with milk). Check the local listings for times and dates of the book and craft fairs that take place along this part of the Castellana. Continuing on, you\''ll pass the massive square and monument to Columbus, and the Biblioteca Nacional (National Library). At this point, the street officially becomes Paseo de la Castellana, a busy commercial area. Here you\''ll find Real Madrid\''s football stadium, Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, and more banks.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Gran Vía</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Traffic surges through this long, noisy avenue, along with swarms of locals and tourists. Look up and admire the eccentric 20th-century architecture built during the Franco era. You\''ll find every style represented, from neo-baroque to art-deco. As you follow the Gran Vía all the way from Calle Alcalá to Plaza de España, take note of the grand old-fashioned movie houses, some of the last of their kind, which continue hiring artists to paint original movie posters. Another building to watch out for is the elegantly-domed Edificio Metrópolis at the Alcalá intersection.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Madrid de los Austrias</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Walk around this historic district, named after the Austrian Hapsburgs, and lose yourself amongst the cobbled, winding alleys, iron balconies and old, leaning buildings. It\''s easy to imagine you\''re back in the 18th Century, especially at night when the street lamps give the place a romantic feel. Visit the Royal Palace, the Opera House and the Plaza Mayor. Enjoy dinner or a drink at one of the great Basque restaurants and elegant cafés.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">La Latina (The Rastro)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Right next to Madrid de los Austrias, this old district is known for its huge array of bars, cafés, and restaurants, and Spain\''s largest flea market, the Rastro. Every Sunday morning, you\''ll find stalls selling everything from valuable antiques to old junk.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Retiro Park</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Escape the city in huge, lush, green Parque del Buen Retiro (Good Retreat Park). Do what the Madrileños do: buy a bag of sunflower seeds or <em>kikos</em> (fried corn kernels), dress up in your Sunday best and stroll down the long <em>paseo</em> (promenade) in front of the pond overlooked by a statue of Alfonso XII. On sunny days, you can rent a rowboat, or enjoy the numerous magicians, folk musicians, and poets performing on the promenade. The best way to enter the park is from Calle Alcalá, passing the 19th-century Puerta de Alcalá. Beware of pickpockets in this area, especially at night. Right outside the park boundaries is the elegant district of Salamanca, which features several upscale boutiques and art galleries.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Moncloa and Argüelles</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The hub of Madrid\''s nightlife, this area is dominated by great tapas bars that don\''t even open until 9p or later. The Palace of Moncloa, where the Spanish Prime Minister resides, is also located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Huertas and Plaza Santa Ana</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is yet another lively spot for cafés, bars, and nightlife action. It is centered around Plaza de Santa Ana. Located close to Madrid de los Austrias, this is also the place to go to see live music. The crowds here consist of mainly 20- to 30-somethings.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Malasaña and Chueca</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is a fairly quiet area during the day, with winding streets and 19th-century architecture. At night, it\''s transformed into a busy nightlife spot as young and old mix in the many bars, discos, and cafés. Malasaña is dominated by Plaza Dos de Mayo, while Chueca is the epicenter for the city\''s gay population. During the day head to the Plaza de Chueca and experience the hip gay crowd of Madrid. At night, discos like Black & White are great places to go for dance or even a drag show!</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The 800 year old Koutoubia Mosque and the Mosque Ben Youssef near the Médersa Ben Youssef are two examples of beautiful ancient architecture. The Ben Youssef Mosque is so holy that non-Muslims are not permitted to enter. The same is true of the Zaouïa Sidi Bel Abbès, the grave site of Marrakech\''s patron saint. The Dar Si Said and the Musée de Marrakech were both constructed in the 19th Century. There are also more modest but equally beautiful places, like the Maison Tiskiwin (Musée Bert Flint) <em>riad</em>, which showcases local artifacts that tell the history of the city. If you are interested in contemporary art, don\''t forget to take a look at the oldest and most acclaimed gallery in Marrakech, the Matisse Art Gallery, located in the Gueliz district, to discover the creativity of present-day Moroccan artists by observing their unique painting and sculpting styles. The Mouassine Museum, a glorious architectural vestige from the Saadi dynasty makes for a beautiful visit, while the Berber Museum, tucked away in the Majorelle Gardens, displays a stunning array of traditional costumes, artwork and handicrafts. For glimpses of contemporary art, visit the David Bloch Gallery, and the La Qoubba Galerie D\''art in the old medina for splendid local art.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater & Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Jemaâ El Fna square, the heart of the medina, is like its own little world. Immerse yourself in its unique atmosphere and watch the bustling crowds while you have a meal or drink in the evening. Visitors who enjoy cultural events can check out the Institut Francais in the Gueliz district. It hosts film showings, theater performances, dance shows and various exhibitions. Also stop by the Théâtre Royal in Gueliz, both for its architecture and the exhibits that are hosted there. If you want to stay in the medina, stop at the Fondation Culturelle Dar Bellarj, which promotes local Moroccan artists through different events and exhibits. The Dar Cherifa hosts concerts, readings and exhibitions. Your best bet if you\''d like to catch a good movie is to check the programming at the French Institut, but the latest American blockbuster can be found at Colisée or Megarama, popular cinemas in Marrakech.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Bo&Zin is perhaps one of the most famous lounges among the celebrities passing through Marrakech, followed by Comptoir Darna and Palais Jad Mahal. Those who love Latin beats can choose between the Afric\''n Chic and La Casa. There are only a few steps between the Casino de Marrakech and the ThéâtrO, one of the most popular nightclubs in Marrakech. From classics like Le Diamant Noir to more modern venues like Pacha Marrakech, this city is a dynamic hotspot for everyone.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoors</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Jardins de la Ménara, with its famous pavilion, and the Jardins de la Ménara, are two ideal places for a stroll. The little jewel of Marrakech is the Jardin Majorelle & Musée d\''art Islamique, a wonderful botanical garden created by French painter Jacques Majorelle. But romanticism isn\''t the only thing Marrakech\''s gardens have to offer: modernity is an asset of the Cyber Park Arsat Moulay Abdeslam, which is equipped with Wi-Fi hotspots. The Palmeraie area encompasses three Golf courses, among them is the oldest in the country, the Royal Golf Club. A nice way to go to the Palmeraie from the medina is to ride a <em>calash</em>. This provides a nice tour in the medina and around the Remparts de Marrakech. As for tennis players, they will appreciate the Royal Tennis Club Marrakech. Finding a place to do some horse riding isn\''t a problem, Marrakech is full of equestrian clubs, such as Les Cavaliers De L\''atlas.If you prefer to kick back and relax, bask in the sun around the swimming pools of La Plage Rouge or Nikki Beach, where DJs blend right into the setting. Don\''t hesitate to go take day trips to the Vallée de l\''ourika, which is dotted with Berbere villages like Setti Fatma. You could also organize a trip to the Parc National de Toubkal, where you can get great views of the surrounding natural beauty.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Marrakesh offers an arsenal of shopping experiences that satisfy every fantasy, from characterful <em>souks </em>bursting with color and life, to luxury boutiques displaying avant-garde designs. Artisanal treasures are guaranteed when you are in the world\''s <em>souk</em> capital, where seemingly endless alleyways and narrow lanes hold limitless treasures - lanterns, lamps, scarves, pottery, ceramic items, perfumes, mirrors, bags, accessories and more. In this wonderful city, <em>souks </em>are also categorized as per their specialty; so you can buy your spices from the Rahba Kehdima, or mystical carpets from the Carpet Souk. Other prominent souks include the Creiee Berbere and Souq Haddadine. Mustapha Blaoui offers an assemblage of glassware items and priceless home decor objects, while 33 Rue Majorelle is your upscale stop for sartorial choices sourced from over 50 Moroccan designers.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1271,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Medina</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The 19-kilometer (11-mile) long Remparts de Marrakech encircles the biggest <em>medina</em> (old Arabic town) in Morocco, which has been on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list since 1985. It is the historical heart of Marrakech. The beautiful minaret of the Koutoubia Mosque, dating from Almohad times, overlooks the medina, whose epicenter is the famous Jemaâ El Fna. The ochre buildings, the hustle and bustle of the markets and commercial streets filled with artisans, and the beauty of the monuments and <em>riads</em> (guesthouses) hidden behind alleyway walls make the medina an enthralling place to visit.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Souks Quarter</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Starting directly north of Jemaâ El Fna square, the Souks quarter is made up of ancient <em>souks</em> (markets) that are divided into craft guilds, which have retained their location on the square for centuries. This is probably the most touristy quarter of the medina, with its numerous surrounding <em>riads</em> and its maze of little alleyways, which are full of shops and always crowded with pedestrians. In the center of it all, you\''ll find the shadowed <em>kissarias</em> (covered souks) area. To the east, Mouassine Street leads to the big the Fontaine El-Mouassine.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dar El Bacha Quarter</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Between the Souks quarter and the Bab Doukkala quarter lies the Dar El Bacha quarter, whose name comes from the former palace of the despised Pasha of Marrakech in the beginning of the 20th Century, and the lively Riad El Arous area. Riad El Arous is one of the main motor vehicle-accessible streets in this part of the medina. In the northwestern part of the medina, the area of <em>Bab Doukkala</em>, which served as a leper colony during the Middle Ages, offers many <em>riads</em> along with some of Marrakech\''s best restaurants, such as the Dar Moha, Le Restaurant, Pavillon and the famous Dar Yacout. This lively and dynamic storekeeper quarter occupies a favorable location, as it links the medina\''s Souks Quarter to the east, and to the modern Gueliz district to the west. The busy bus station lies after the Bab Doukkala gate. You can easily reach the Bab Doukkala area by taxi.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kasbah Quarter</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">South of the medina, this was the center of power of the political capital that was Marrakech during the Almohad period. Saadian rulers in the 16th Century also settled here, as is evidenced by the vestiges of the Palais El Badi that Sultan Ahmed El Mansour commissioned to be as distinguished as his reign. The political importance of the Kasbah has lessened recently. South of the quarter lie the Agdal Gardens (Jardins de L\''agdal), dating from the 12th Century. Northeast of the Kasbah quarter is the Mellah quarter, the historical Jewish quarter, which unfurls row after row of lively alleyways full of little shops and markets. North of Mellah, Riad Zitoun El-Jedid Street, with its nice shops, leads to Jemaâ El Fna Square and the museums of Dar Si Said and Maison Tiskiwin (Musée Bert Flint), along with the Palais de la Bahia. Though it doesn\''t attract the touristy crowd of the souks, the Riad Zitoun area is one of the most Europeanized quarters of the medina.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ville Nouvelle (New Town)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The New Town lies outside the medina\''s ramparts. It dates back from the times of the French Protectorate, when the Gueliz district was built west of the medina. The project was assigned to a French urban planner in 1912 and first aimed to accommodate the French administration and its officials. Many buildings from those times are now threatened by the present real estate frenzy in Marrakech. The name of this district comes from <em>Gueliz Mountain</em> (which was used for the building of gate Bab Agnaou), west of Marrakech.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Gueliz Quarter</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Today, this district serves as the downtown of modern Marrakech. It is the district of offices and business headquarters, of banks, financial institutions and the train station. In the manner of the Rue de la Liberté, a little shopping heaven, it is also the district of mega-shopping, offering mostly luxury shops and international brands. On the cultural side, there is the Théâtre Royal. The Avenue Mohammed V crosses the Gueliz district. This central avenue, always very traffic-choked during rush hour, links three squares, namely Place Abdel Moumen Ali, Place du 16 Novembre, and Place de la Liberté, after which it enters the medina through gate Bab Nkob. Behind Bab Nkob, you\''ll find the Cyber Park Arsat Moulay Abdeslam. Place Abdel Moumen Ben Ali is easily accessed by pedestrian-only streets and hosts the Délégation Régionale du Tourisme de Marrakech along with cute coffee-houses and shops. As for the Place du 16 Novembre, its home to the central post office. The magnificent Jardin Majorelle & Musée d\''art Islamique lies north of the Gueliz district.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hivernage Quarter</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This quarter lies southeast of the Gueliz district. Several big standing hotels and some ritzy villas have been constructed here in this posh and verdant district that\''s appreciated for its quietness, but also for its happening nightlife spots like the Casino de Marrakech, the ThéâtrO or the Comptoir Darna.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Palmeraie</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The history of Marrakech is indissolubly linked to its palm grove, which was born at the same time as the city, thanks to an ingenious irrigation system commissioned in the 11th Century by the Marrakech\''s founder, Youssef Ben Tachfine. The palm grove stretches northeast of the city for about 6400 hectares (15,814 acres). This surface is much smaller than it used to be, evidence of its frailty due to constant drought. Some measures have been taken to aid the palm grove, like the creation of a date-palm nursery in order to replant the trees if they die. But the palm grove isn\''t only a big garden planted with palm-trees in the shade of which grow the fruit trees; it has also become one of the most sought-after residential districts, and undoubtedly the housing goal of most Marrakech VIPs. In the shade of the palm trees lie golf courses, luxury hotels and the villas of some politicians and stars from France and abroad.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Better suited to art lovers, the impressive National Gallery of Victoria showcases both domestic and international artists, displaying works by such names as Degas, Monet, Boyd, Picasso, and Nolan.Smaller and specialty museums and galleries include the National Sports Museum, Australian Centre for the Moving Image, ArtVo, and Immigration Museum. Two landmarks, the Shrine of Remembrance and Melbourne Cricket Ground, also offer educational experiences in their onsite museums. If you\''re traveling to the city and reserve some time to check out the arts and history scenes, you definitely won\''t be disappointed.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Live Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Melbourne is widely regarded as the live music capital of Australia. Everyone who is anyone in the Australian music scene plays here regularly, and almost-legendary venues are packed every night with fans looking for old favorites or the next big thing. You\''ll find any number of spots to get down to alternative rock, and those interested can also enjoy emerging funk, jazz, and hip hop scenes. Those with more discerning musical tastes have their own slew of options. Have a night out with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra or Opera Australia. While in town, you can also check out the brilliant 85-piece Australian Pops Orchestra or delightful Australian Boys Choir. The sky is truly the limit when it comes to live music is this exciting city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater & Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Melbourne\''s lively theater scene offers everything from experimental works to mainstream, Broadway-style blockbusters like Miss Saigon or the Phantom of the Opera. Better still, the hosts its shows in truly beautiful and historic theaters, such as Her Majesty\''s and the Princess Theatre.  Ballet and dance are as good as any in the world, and the Australian Ballet performs 160 shows a year to packed houses. For something a bit funkier, Chunky Move diverges from traditional theater venues, performing bold works in club-type settings. OzOpera similarly abandons tradition and brings its own version of opera to everyday people in Melbourne and across Victoria. Otherwise, the city hosts a full range of cinemas, from Hoyts and Village blockbuster multiplexes to arthouses like the Astor. An international film festival is held every winter while summer in the city would not be the same without the Moonlight Cinema set in the beautiful surrounds of the Royal Botanical Gardens.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">English-style pubs have traditionally been the bedrock of Melbourne\''s nightlife scene, and the city is blessed with plenty. Every area will have one, which range from grungy to elegant venues. There are traditional watering holes like the quirky Builder\''s Arms. Usually open in the afternoon through midnight or later, many of these establishments serve food as well as providing beer gardens, satellite television, pool tables, or live music. Recently, a slew of stylish, intimate bars have evolved in the lanes and alleyways of the central business district. They draw an eager crowd of after-work drinkers and stay open late. Try a cocktails and comedy at Spleen on Bourke Street or simply explore until you find a place of your own—they seem to pop up in little recesses of the city overnight! Melbourne\''s club scene is large and varied but concentrated in a few different districts. King Street in the city center is home to several large and well-known establishments. South Yarra around Chapel Street attracts a hipper crowd to venues like Revolver while Brunswick and Smith Streets in Fitzroy cater to a more bohemian, alternative crowd with a smaller venue, the Night Cat. St Kilda, home to Monkey, is also a lively part of town. The Crown Entertainment Complex is home to a variety of establishments, from cabarets to wine bars to jazz clubs. Its casino is one of the largest in the world, housing a five-star hotel and plethora of shops and restaurants on the southern bank of the Yarra River.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals & Events</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Melbourne keeps a packed events calendar throughout the year. It hosts a major international arts festival known as the Fringe Festival, and the family-oriented Moomba Waterfest is an equally good time. There are separate celebrations for comedy, contemporary visual art, gardening, writing, fashion, and food. There are also Italian, Greek, Vietnamese, and Chinese festivals, not to mention happenings in St Kilda, Chapel Street, Williamstown, and Brunswick Street. Summer is the time for outdoor cinema, classical music, and jazz, and Melbourne also hosts trade fairs for industries as diverse as holidays, motoring, and aeronautics.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Melbourne is renowned for its major international sporting events, including the Australian Open Grand Slam tennis tournament, the Grand Prix motor race, marathons, cricket tests, and major golf tournaments. But perhaps its biggest sporting events are its most unique. The AFL Grand Final decides the champion of the national football code, and the famous Melbourne Cup horse race is held like clockwork on the second Tuesday of November, bringing the whole city, if not the nation, to a halt.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1281,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Central Business District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Laid out as a grid, the Melbourne city center is delightfully easy to navigate. The modern skyline of the financial district contrasts with well-preserved Victorian architecture, and the alleyways and arcades that snake through the city give it undeniable charm and character. Swanston Street, generally considered the city\''s main drag, runs from the ornate 19th-century domes of Flinders Street Station to the gleaming, billion-dollar Melbourne Central Shopping Complex. Elsewhere, the stretch of Collins Street between Swanston and Spring Streets is a more exclusive shopping strip. Known as \"the Paris end\" of the city, it is home to luxury boutiques, upmarket offices, and prestigious hotels. Running parallel is Bourke Street, the oldest and most successful pedestrian precinct in the city, where major department stores like David Jones and Myer are located. A block away, the entrance to Melbourne\''s Chinatown on Little Bourke Street is marked by an ornate Chinese arch. Spilling into the surrounding alleys, the worldly area represents one of the oldest Chinatowns outside Asia and plays host to a variety of restaurants and grocery stores.The area between Swanston and Spencer Streets is nine-to-five territory, Australia\''s corporate heartland and headquarters of many of its largest enterprises. Ambitious plans are afoot to further extend this area by redeveloping the derelict warehouses of the adjacent docklands. The Etihad Stadium was the first project to be unveiled, and if the developers have their way, the world\''s tallest building will soon follow. To the south and east lies a vast and beautifully maintained belt of parkland, containing the Fitzroy Gardens and Melbourne Cricket Ground, with the Royal Botanical Gardens lying just across the Yarra River.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Southbank</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the southern bank of the muddy and surprisingly narrow river lies the landmark Victorian Arts Centre and chic Southgate shopping and dining precinct. Further along is the glitzy Crown Entertainment Complex, which offers 24-hour entertainment, luxury stores, nightclubs, eateries, and one of the world\''s largest gaming facilities. Hugely controversial, it is one of the city\''s most popular, and popularly detested, sites. Whether the locals like it or not, it is also Melbourne\''s favorite visitor attraction. Directly opposite are the state-of-the-art Sea Life Melbourne Aquarium, Convention Center, and Exhibition Center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Prahran & South Yarra</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just outside of the city are Prahran and South Yarra, names often used interchangeably for roughly the same area. Home to Chapel Street, lined with boutiques and nightclubs, this is Melbourne\''s favorite playground. It\''s packed every weekend with young people out for only one thing—fun! Saturday nights see the street grind to a halt and transform into a traffic-jam disco as cars blare top volume techno music while the gay strip along Commercial Road buzzes alongside. The funkier, more relaxed Greville Street plays host to vintage fashion stores and a lively weekend market. South of Prahran is Toorak, which is synonymous with discreet wealth and home to many top executives.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">St Kilda</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Further out is St Kilda, which has transformed from a shabby red light district to a bayside resort and now serves as a popular place for backpackers and locals on sunny weekends. Its biggest attraction is the lively street life along Acland and Fitzroy Streets. The district also boasts Luna Park, an ornate and historic fun fair along the waterfront, as well as a lovely pier, weekend craft market, and the Prince of Wales hotel.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Carlton</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Carlton lies just north of Melbourne proper. Many of its quaint Victorian terrace houses have been converted into student accommodation for the nearby university, and the district\''s cafés and bookstores buzz with life. The new Melbourne Museum is located here in the beautiful Carlton Gardens. Lygon Street, arguably the city\''s premier dining strip, boasts a large Italian community, as well as restaurants serving Malay, Japanese, Vietnamese, and even Jamaican fare.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fitzroy</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Even more cosmopolitan is Brunswick Street, one of Melbourne\''s liveliest and most distinctive streets. Originally a working class neighborhood, the Fitzroy area has emerged as the heartland of bohemian café culture. It hums night and day with colorful bars, nightclubs, and restaurants of every kind, as well as funky and unconventional stores.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Williamstown & Other Areas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A little further out, albeit still easily accessible by ferry or train, lies old Williamstown, a once-vital port. This quiet residential suburb has recently regained favor after many years in decline. Picturesque and historic streets, views over the sea, and pride in bygone days attract hundreds of weekend visitors throughout the year. Once home to Greek immigrants, the Richmond area has more recently become known as \"Little Saigon\" because of its growing Vietnamese community. You\''ll find delicious restaurants and shops along Victoria Street. Moreover, the factory outlet stores of Bridge Road and Swan Street offer some of the best bargain buys around. Tree-lined streets and beautiful town houses distinguish South Melbourne, which is popular both for its namesake South Melbourne Market and growing breakfast café scene. Port Melbourne is being transformed from derelict docks to inner city dwellings while Albert Park is home to the Grand Prix in addition to being a popular spot for joggers and dog walkers.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

This street, where B.B. King got his start, has been revived through a joint initiative of the city council and local merchants. Beale Street bars and clubs feature an outstanding variety of live music every night. Rum Boogie Café attracts 20-somethings who come to dance to the hot rhythms of R&B and rock groups, while Kings Palace Café draws listeners with its line-up of blues artists. In the spirit of \"something for everyone,\" The New Daisy theater books alternative groups for the young and hip crowd. On weekends, Beale is closed to traffic and comes alive with bands playing both inside and out, tourists and locals mingling in the streets, and artists entertaining viewers with gymnastic antics. On special weekends, a particular type of music, such as Zydeco, may be featured. A wristband assures unlimited entry into all clubs.  With numerous venues like the Mud Island Amphitheater, there always seems to be a concert of some kind. If nothing in Memphis appeals to you, take a short drive to Tunica, just south of Memphis, and catch one of the many concerts at the strip of casinos that have sprung up along the Mississippi.  Every year in May, thousands of people travel from all over to take part in the rapidly growing Beale Street Music Festival. This three-day event includes six different stages, each dedicated to a different kind of music. Whether you enjoy rock, blues, country or jazz, this festival has it all. In recent years, artists such as Bob Dylan, Percy Sledge, Joan Jett and Bryan Adams, plus groups such as Creed, Dave Matthews Band, the Allman Brothers, Los Lobos and the Foo Fighters have played here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In a city lacking mountains and lakes, many nature lovers may feel a bit stifled. However, they can retreat to any of Memphis\'' many parks for a little peace and greenery. For example, the recently-completed Riverwalk in Tom Lee Park provides an escape along the river just seconds from downtown.  Overton Park, in Midtown, encompasses the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art and a golf course. On any sunny morning, the park is filled with Midtowners walking their dogs or jogging the trails. Travelers can make a day of it by visiting the Memphis Zoo and Aquarium, checking out the museum and then relaxing in the park.  Near the University of Memphis, Audubon Park provides the perfect setting for a shady picnic on a hot day. This is where many locals have their Fourth of July picnics, eating barbecue from their favorite restaurant, of course. A creative anachronism group meets here on Sundays, staging medieval battles with realistic looking armor and weapons. Spectators are welcome to watch but need not fear that the \"knights\" will fall victim to any real injury.  Just outside of Memphis are Meeman-Shelby and Shelby Farms. Meeman-Shelby, to the north of Memphis, offers fishing, horseback riding and camping. Bring a picnic and check out the horses at Shelby Farms, located just northeast of Memphis. If you\''re lucky, you will see some of the buffalo that graze here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Memphis locals enjoy their theater almost as much as their music, even if the theater scene is not as well-known. The strong theater tradition in Memphis has produced such stars as Cybill Shepherd, Kathy Bates and Michael Jeeter. Just a block from the Peabody Hotel is the restored Orpheum Theater featuring touring productions of Broadway hits such as \"Cats\" and \"Phantom of the Opera\" as well as performances such as \"Stomp\" and \"River Dance\". For local theater, check out the Circuit Playhouse and Playhouse on the Square in Midtown or Theatre Memphis in the University of Memphis area. All three theaters stage traditional favorites like Noel Coward\''s \"Private Lives,\" as well as more experimental pieces by modern playwrights. Playbills from these theaters reflect the eagerness with which up-and-coming thespians come to Memphis.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Film</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the past to see a movie, locals had to travel out to one of the many multiplexes in East Memphis and Germantown. Today, however, Malco opened Studio on the Square, a 4-screen cinema in Midtown specializing in foreign and art films with a cappuccino/wine bar and lounge.  Memphis has become a popular site among movie-makers in the years since John Grisham\''s book \"The Firm\" was filmed here. Low costs and a mild climate have lured producers such as Sidney Pollack and stars such as Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love. Visitors may find themselves on the edge of a scene being filmed on Beale Street, on the skyway to Mud Island or sitting in the Peabody Hotel lobby with celebrities relaxing after a day\''s work.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Where would Memphis be without a museum dedicated to Elvis? How about one dedicated entirely to his cars? The Elvis Presley Automobile Museum, near Graceland, displays the collection of unusual and classic cars that Elvis prized.  And, of course, there is a museum dedicated to music. At the Memphis Music Hall of Fame you can see the vintage equipment actually used at the legendary Sun Studio to record artist such as Elvis and B.B.King. Exhibits trace the history of rock n\'' roll, soul and R&B in this area of the country over the past 50 years. Visitors will enjoy the photographs of their favorite artists as well as videos and displays of the actual instruments used to create some of the most memorable music of this era.  The Lorraine Hotel, where Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, has been turned into the National Civil Rights Museum. Visit the room where he was shot and learn about his civil rights efforts. A life-size bus exhibit allows visitors to feel what it was like when Rosa Parks was told to sit at the back of the bus. Other interactive displays bring to life the history of African-Americans in the South and the struggles of those who fought for civil rights. It is an inspiring place for anyone who has ever pondered the flaws in human nature that allow prejudice and racism to exist.  While wandering down Beale Street, be sure to stop at the Beale Street Police Station, home of the Memphis Police Museum. Learn about the history of the police department in Memphis and sit inside an original jail cell. See the photographs and records of small time crooks and nationally-hunted criminals such as James Earl Ray, the assassin of Martin Luther King, Jr.  On a lighter side, children will enjoy learning and playing at the Children\''s Museum of Memphis. This museum in midtown includes hands-on exhibits as well as replicas of planes, trains and automobiles where children can learn as they explore.  Art buffs will want to spend some time at the Brooks Museum of Art to see its top-notch collection of medieval paintings or the Dixon Gallery and Gardens for its impressionist works. The Dixon also holds concerts in the gardens every spring and summer.  Those interested more in cultural history can pretend to shop in a life-size replica of the first Piggly-Wiggly Grocery Store at the Pink Palace Museum. Previous exhibits have focused on the prehistoric wildlife of the Mississippi River Valley and the fossils found in the La Brea tar pits. This museum also houses a planetarium and IMAX theater. When the nights are clear and warm, telescopes are provided on the lawn for star-gazers of all ages.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Until recently, Memphis had only a few professional sports teams. Now, the city seems to have gone mad for the triple-A Redbirds baseball team. The Autozone Park provides an ideal venue for this team and has locals clamoring for tickets. Riverkings ice hockey team has been around a bit longer. Locals, who rarely see ice and snow on the ground, have embraced this winter sport. Although many of the players are transplanted Canadians, they are local celebrities with fans as rabid as any in Canada.  Although the University of Memphis has a football team, it is far better known for a tradition of nationally-competitive basketball teams.  Tennis fans will enjoy benefiting St. Jude Children\''s Hospital by watching the Kroger St. Jude Tennis Tournament which takes place every February with featured stars such as John McEnroe and Michael Becker.  St. Jude also benefits from the FedEx St. Jude Classic Golf Tournament held June at the South Winds course in Germantown. This has become a premier event on the pro-golfers\'' circuit. If you missed the tournament, there are many public and private golf courses in Memphis where you can practice your swing including the Overton and Audubon Park courses.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Casinos</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The first casino on the Mississippi opened in Tunica, about an hour and a half south of Memphis. Tunica had long occupied the unenviable position of \"poorest county in the country.\" The hope was that casinos would bring in tourist money and jobs. Within five years, this initiative proved remarkably successful. A line of casinos and hotels now stretch down the river along Highway 61, beginning just about 12 miles south of the state border. While the primary activity of casinos—gambling—doesn\''t vary much from one neon-lit building to the next, there are differences in atmosphere and other facilities that make it worthwhile to plan a few stops on your trip to \"the Las Vegas of the Mid-South.\"  The Hollywood Casino has perhaps the most interesting decor. Actual props from movies, movie posters and photos of major celebrities line the halls. The casino sometimes exhibits memorabilia such as souvenirs of Elvis from the private collection of his long-time physician. Even the key chain to hold the ubiquitous player\''s card is in the form of the famous \"Lights, camera, action!\" signboard.  While most of the casinos have a variety of dining options including lavish buffets, steakhouses and cafés, one of the most popular places to eat is the Village Square Buffet at the Horseshoe Casino and Hotel. It features areas devoted to particular cuisines: grilled vegetables and pasta in the Tuscany section, dumplings and stir-fries in the Chinese area, and spicy Creole dishes from New Orleans. Horseshoe also has a Blues and Legends Hall of Fame Museum to tour when you need a break from the slots. There is also a Bluesville Showcase Nightclub featuring some of the best blues musicians in concert every weekend.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">How many cities can boast a festival that lasts for a full month? The Memphis in May celebration comprises 31 days of music, dance and theater as well as the lesser arts of barbecue and wine carrying! Every year, one country is chosen as the focus for events around the city. Past years have honored France, the Ivory Coast, Portugal and Australia. As part of the celebration, recurring events include the Beale Street Music Festival, the World Championship Barbecue Contest, the Great Southern Food Festival and the Sunset Symphony concert performed by the Memphis Symphony on the banks of the river. Other sanctioned events include a canoe and kayak race and the wine carrying race where local waiters compete in the Olympics of table service.  It seems as though there\''s a festival somewhere in Memphis every weekend of the year. And that is not too far from true. The Italian Festival in June highlights the heritage of an important element of Memphis\'' population with spaghetti gravy contests and a boules court. The Pink Palace Crafts Fair brings craftsmen and artist from all over the country to ply their wares under big tents on the grounds of Audubon Park. Arts in the Park celebrates every aspect of art and culture with ballet troops from Russia, prizes for painting, sculpture and photography and craft tables for interactive activities for children.  The Cooper-Young Festival in the gentrified midtown neighborhood, the Greek Festival and the River Arts Fest all contribute to the festivities in Memphis.  Last, but definitely not least, is the Mid-South Fair, held in late September through early October every year in neighboring Mississippi. The traditional county fair competitions in jelly making, quilt sewing, cattle breeding and hog calling are supplemented with amusement park games and rides, art and photography competitions, craft sales and the ever popular \"fair food.\" It\''s a cultural and recreational event not to be missed.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

However, there are various museums in the city that are not to be missed. The Museo Nacional de Antropología (National Anthropology Museum) is one of the most renowned museums in the world, and houses extensive collections of artifacts from Mesoamerica, including the famous Aztec Sun Stone. The Museo Arqueológico de Xochimilco (Archaeological Museum of Xochimilco) is a recreation of what life was like in Xochimilco in pre-Hispanic times. The museum houses objects that date as far back as to the Olmec culture, or around 9000 BCE. The Museo Nacional de Historia (National History Museum) is located in the Castillo de Chapultepec and features exhibits about the social and political history of Mexico. The museum also features murals by some of Mexico\''s most famous artists. The Museo del Templo Mayor is a modern building constructed on the site of the Aztec Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan in the Zócalo. Here you can view artifacts from the temple, including the original stone depiction of the goddess Coyolxauhqui. Mexico City has also been home to many famous artists, and there is certainly no shortage of museums dedicated to them. The Frida Kahlo Museum is located in the artist\''s former home, and in addition to her own works you can view other personal possessions of hers as well as works by other Mexican painters. Another artist who has several museums dedicated to him is Diego Rivera. The <span class=\"st\">Museo Diego Rivera Anahuacalli</span> is of the artist\''s own conception and displays the impressive collection of pre-Hispanic artifacts the artist acquired during his lifetime. The Museo de Arte Moderno (Museum of Modern Art) features works from many different painters of the Mexican school of painting.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mexico City is home to many theaters and many theater productions of all kinds. Among the best-known theaters for live drama or comedy is the Teatro Insurgentes. Teatro Sergio Magaña in Santa María La Ribera presents mainly comedies featuring television actors and actresses. Teatro Benito Juárez puts on classic plays as well as other internationally famous works for incredibly affordable prices.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Being one of the world\''s largest cities, Mexico City often hosts some of the world\''s biggest names and concerts in music. The Estadio Azteca hosts many of these blockbuster events. The Palacio de Bellas Artes, along with being one of the city\''s most beautiful landmarks, also plays host to classical concerts, opera, and some theater as well. Among those who perform at the Palacio de Bellas Artes is the Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional, who perform both classical and contemporary works. The Orquesta de Cámara de Bellas Artes puts on classical, chamber music and choir performances throughout the year while the Orquesta Filarmónica de la Ciudad de México frequently hosts guest musicians and composers at the Ollín Yoliztli Cultural Center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoors</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mexico City is full of parks and other opportunities to spend time outdoors. The 1600 acre Bosque de Chapultepec is a large park just east of the center of the city which is home to numerous attractions, including a lake, where you can hire a boat and paddle around. The Bosque de Chapultepec makes for a fun day out, whether you are taking a bike ride, a walk or just lying in the grass. Another of the city\''s main parks is the Alameda Central, where visitors will find a number of statues and monuments among the greenery and fountains. The Alameda Central is also a historic site in the city, as it dates back to the 16th Century. One of the oldest attractions in Mexico City are the ancient canals, or <em>chinampas</em> of Xochimilco, which means \"land of the flowers\" in Nahuatl. These canals are lined with flowers and floating vendors, while visitors can cruise the 14 kilometers (8.5 miles) of canals in wooden boats decorated with flowers. There are several good outdoor retreats just outside the city as well. The Bosque Nacional del Desierto de los Leones is a 200 hectare retreat of greenery where people go to escape the city by bicycling, jogging, and doing other outdoor activities. The Cerro de la Estrella is located next to Lake Texcoco, and is the ancient site of Aztec sun renewal ceremonies. Aside from visiting the hill itself, visitors can go to the museum to learn more about the history of this special place.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Family & Kids</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Being that Mexico City is one of the largest in the world, there is no shortage of family and kid-friendly activities. For something a little educational that the whole family will find interesting, visit the Papalote Museo del Niño children\''s museum, with its interactive exhibits and IMAX theater. Another museum the kids will enjoy is Ripley\''s Ciudad de México, where you will be immersed in a world of stuff that\''s almost too weird to believe, like shrunken heads and human hair dresses. Mexico City is also home to the world class Six Flags México amusement park with its exciting roller coasters. Here in the city, you will also find a number of zoos, like the Parque Zoológico de Chapultepec, located in the Bosque de Chapultepec and the Zoológico Los Coyotes.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Historic Attractions</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As Mexico City is such an old and historic city, the numbers of historic attractions in and near the city are endless. Probably the most popular attraction are the ruins of the ancient city of Teotihuacan, with its grand pyramids of the sun and moon, along with 156 square kilometers (60 square miles) of temples, altars and other fascinating objects. In another part of the city, the Arbol de la Noche Triste (Tree of the Sad Night) is the tree under which the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés is said to have cried during his troops\'' retreat from the city of Tenochtitlan, which shares its location with modern-day Mexico City. Another historic sight pertaining to Cortés is the Casa de la Malinche, the house where his Aztec lover and interpreter once lived. Today a school is housed inside. The Plaza de la Constitución / El Zócalo was constructed on top of the ceremonial site of Tenochtitlan beginning in the 16th Century and today serves as the city\''s primary plaza. On one side of the Zócalo is the Palacio Nacional, built by Cortés on top of King Moctezuma\''s royal residence (you can still see some of the foundation inside.) The Palacio contains several murals by Mexico\''s most famous painter, Diego Rivera. The historic Castillo de Chapultepec, located in the Bosque de Chapultepec was once home to the Emperor Maximilian and Empress Carlotta during the French occupation of Mexico. Since 1939, the castle has been the home of the National History Museum. The Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe is built on the famed spot where an indigenous man named Juan Diego had a vision of the Virgin Mary. After Juan Diego told the bishop, he was skeptical and demanded proof, and Juan Diego had another vision: the image of the virgin appeared in a cape with which Diego was carrying roses. The bishop immediately ordered a church built on the site of these visions. Today, visitors can see the miraculous cape in a case behind the altar. Mexico City also has its fair share of monuments commemorating the many wars, struggles and heroes throughout the city and country\''s history. Probably the most famous is the Monumento a la Independencia, also known as <em>El Ãngel</em> (the angel). El Ãngel was built to commemorate the centennial of Mexico\''s War of Independence, and it was erected in 1910, after being commissioned by President Porfirio Díaz in 1902. The monument also includes a mausoleum at its base which holds the remains of 12 heroes of Mexican independence. Also commissioned by Porfirio Díaz is the Monumento a la Revolución, which stands in the Plaza de la República next to the Museo Nacional de la Revolución, and is home to the remains of two Mexican presidents. The Monumento a los Niños Héroes was built in honor of the six teenage cadets who died defending Chapultepec Castle from United States forces in 1847, and the <em>niños heroes</em> are honored in various ways all over Mexico City and the entire country.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Several museums are tucked away within this enormous green space, including the National Anthropology Museum, Rufino Tamayo Museum, Museum of Modern Art and Papalote Children\''s Museum. The National History Museum is housed in the most important and visible attraction in the park, the Castillo de Chapultepec, a sumptuous castle whose rich history reflects the entire history of Mexico itself. Nearby is La Feria, the city\''s oldest amusement park. Los Pinos, the official residence of the President of Mexico, is nestled inside these woods, along with the National Auditorium, the city\''s large and modern auditorium which stages world famous performances. Just north of Chapultepec is the elegant commercial and residential neighborhood of Polanco. This district is popular among the city\''s affluent residents; excellent restaurants, designer boutiques and world class hotels are found here. A scenic stroll down the beautiful Paseo de la Reforma leads to the Fuente de la Diana Cazadora and to the landmark Monumento a la Independencia, commonly known as <em>El Ãngel</em> (The Angel).</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Zona Rosa</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Zona Rosa is an area near the center of the city that is bustling with activity and entertainment. Known for its array of restaurants, bars, cafes and shops, it is an ideal place to relax with a drink or a bite to eat while people-watching. Stop in at the Wax Museum to rub elbows with the biggest stars and VIPs of yesterday and today. Also in the area is the Central de Abastos, one of the largest markets in the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Centro Histórico</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Down Paseo de la Reforma, across Avenida Juárez is the historic part of the city. The Palace of Fine Arts is found here, across from the Torre Latinoamericana and the Alameda Central. Continue down Avenida Francisco Madero to reach the Zócalo / Plaza de la Constitución, the city\''s enormous main square, on which its founding institutions were erected, including the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Palacio Nacional and the ancient Aztec Templo Mayor. The diverse origins of Mexican cultures are apparent here, illustrating its inherent mix. The<em> </em>Centro Histórico also offers architectural sightseeing, shopping, dining and a chance to experience city life.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">San Ãngel</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Down the tree-lined Avenida Insurgentes, dotted with shops and entertainment, is the colonial neighborhood of San Ãngel. Here, you will find the monument to General Ãlvaro Obregón, named for the ex-president whose forearm and hand—with a ringed finger—floats poised under glass inside the scenic Jardín de la Bombilla. Among other sites are the Jardín del Arte, Plaza San Jacinto, and the Ex-Convento del Carmen, famous for its collection of mummies on exhibit.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Coyoacán</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You could easily dedicate a full day to meander the cobblestone and unpaved streets around the city\''s most attractive area, Coyoacán. Coyoacán is a traditional colonial district filled with churches, parks, gardens, plazas, museums and book shops. From the 1920s to the 1950s it was a haven for such bohemians and intellectuals as Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and Salvador Novo, and has retained that aura up to present day. Because of its past residents and interesting history, this is where you will find such interesting places to visit as the Diego Rivera-Anahuacalli Museum, the Frida Kahlo Museum, and the León Trotsky House & Museum.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

The ever-popular dance clubs around the Beach include the always rocking Cameo. Salsa dancing can also be found all over the city. South Beach generally carries the bulk of the dance clubs, while Coconut Grove offers a variety of live music venues. Miami\''s nightlife, however, is much too diverse and extensive for such generalizations. You can always find something going on every corner. Some of the best of the best are Story - a megaclub that oozes exclusivity, with bottle service and a line-up of underground musicians and top-notch DJs - while the Basement is a multi-room, nighttime escape with a stellar program of thrilling club nights. Then there\''s the uber-glitzy LIV at Fontainebleau, - a celebrity hangout, and host to fantastic DJs from across the globe and big-name hip-hop acts on any given night. For a party on the sands, head to Nikki Beach, or try the Purdy Lounge for a cocktail by the sea. From scintillating nightclubs and glamorous bars to laid-back pubs and underground haunts, Miami has it all and more in spades.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping in Miami is an experience to be savored. The city\''s retail therapy landscape is a delightfully diverse one with everything from shopping streets lined with department stores, luxury boutiques and cafes, to sprawling malls, kitschy souvenir stalls and quaint vintage shops. The Aventura Mall is one of Miami\''s most upscale, anchored by six department stores and luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Fendi. The Brickell City Center is another popular destination for luxury shopping, while the Dadeland Mall is home to the state\''s largest Macy\''s. The Shops at Merrick Park and Bal Harbour Shops are other great Floridian shopping destinations.While Miami\''s malls are sure to thrill, the city\''s fabulous shopping streets are the way to go for an authentic and eclectic Floridian shopping excursion. South Beach\''s Lincoln Road, Collins Avenue and Washington Avenue top the list when it comes to big-name brands, while Sunset Harbour is the place to be for locally-owned boutiques and hip specialty shops. In downtown Miami, you\''ll come across the La Epoca department store and a host of fabric shops down Flagler Street. The Design District is thronged with designer boutiques while Wynwood dazzles with a quirky mix of art galleries and hip little stores. The Miracle Mile in Coral Gables and CocoWalk in Coconut Grove are other iconic shopping locales in Miami.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Miami attracts a medley of sounds and talents. Whether it\''s a jazz festival, a symphony orchestra concert or the Latin beats of Miami\''s own Gloria Estefan, the city\''s musical offerings are never at a loss. The innovative New World Symphony showcases fresh talent. Also of interest is the talented Miami Symphony Orchestra. The New World Center is Miami\''s premier concert hall, designed by renown architect, Frank Gehry. There is also the Florida Grand Opera, which presents five productions annually, and a whole host of bars that showcase live music. At the top of the list are Gramps, Ball & Chain, Churchill\''s Pub, Bougainvillea\''s Old Florida Tavern, Wynwood Yard and Lagniappe, each catering to distinct tastes and genres.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You\''ll come across a fair share of modern multiplexes across the city, but Miami\''s penchant for indie entertainment best shines through at its many independent and arthouse cinemas. The Miami Beach Cinematheque is one of the best, an HD, Art Deco gem built in 1927 that screens limited-release films and is a venue for several of Miami\''s prestigious film festivals. The O Cinema, on the other hand, is a contemporary theater featuring foreign, independent, art and family films. The Soundscape Cinema at the New World Center is another stellar venue, an al fresco cinema that screens movies and simulcasts of symphonies for free. Other acclaimed venues include the historic Tower Theater and the Coral Gables Art Cinema.Each year, Miami also hosts a slew of film festivals, the most famous of which is the Miami International Film Festival. The Miami Short Film Festival and Miami Independent Film Festival also attract much interest.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals & Fairs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Throughout the year, Miami plays host to a flurry of festivals, fairs and events. From January through March, visitors and locals look forward events like to the Art Deco Week, the Coral Gables Art Festival, the Martin Luther King Jr. Day Parade, Calle Ocho, the Funkshion Fashion Week, the International Boat Show and the Ultra Music Festival amongst many others. Later in the year, the Miami Beach Gay Parade, the Miami Fashion Week, Miami Carnival and International Auto Show take center stage. The International Book Fair, King Mango Strut Parade and  Art Basel round off the year in Miami.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Miami\''s sun-kissed beaches are its most popular feature; miles of golden sand littered with bronzed bodies lounging by the water. The beaches of Miami are an ideal destination for fans of water sports, as well as for those who simply want to bask in the sunshine. Miami has much more to offer besides. Outdoor enthusiasts can explore the miles of hiking trails at the Oleta River State Recreational Area, embark on an airboat tour of the Everglades, sign-up for sailing lessons and indulge in deep sea fishing. Yacht charters and jet boat rides are other popular pastimes in Miami.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whatever your interest, Miami offers a museum related to it. Celebrate the city\''s intriguing past at the Historical Museum of Southern Florida. Take a stroll through the exquisite 16th-century Italian Villa Vizcaya and gardens. For those who enjoy the visual arts, there are outstanding collections at the Miami Art Museum, the Bass Museum of Art, the Wolfsonian, the Lowe Art Museum and the Jewish Museum of Florida.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">No matter what the season, the stage is always set in Miami. Whether it\''s a Broadway road show or a local production, the audience is sure to be dazzled. The nationally acclaimed Coconut Grove Playhouse is famous for premiering shows that go on to successful runs in New York. In the elegant Biltmore Hotel, GableStage offers an exciting season of Florida premieres and New York hits. The Actor\''s Playhouse at the Miracle Theatre also offers quality productions by a talented residential troupe. The Miami Light Project - a non-profit organization that produces music, dance and theater - has the freshest talent in town. Teatro Avante presents regular performances in Spanish. Miami\''s cultural venues are as intriguing for their appearance as for the performances on their stages. Audiences have much to admire during intermission with the charming Art Deco design of the Colony Theatre.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Comedy</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Good humor comes naturally in a city blessed with beautiful weather year-round. A few local clubs feature comedians that keep the visitors and locals laughing into the wee hours. The Villain Theater tops the list of Miami\''s best comedy clubs, featuring sketch shows and Chicago-stye improv that have the audience shaking with mirth. Just the Funny is another worthy contender for the coveted title of Miami\''s funniest troupe. The ensemble showcases comedy of every genre, with everything from comedic songs and sketch shows to stand-up and parodies on the cards. Other venues that also host comedians alongside musicians, spoken word artists and other performers are Artistic Vibes in Kendall, Speak! Fridays in Wynwood, the RedBar in Downtown and the Open Stage Club in Coral Gables. The Backroom Comedy Club and the Comedy Inn are other worthy contenders for a rib-tickling good time.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dance</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From classical to modern to ethnic, Miami has a rich array of dance theater. Even the most classical repertoire is infused with a certain innovative quality. The Miami City Ballet is recognized as one of the top ten companies in the nation. The company\''s impressive repertoire (over 80 productions and counting) delicately blends the classical and the contemporary. For the more traditionally inclined, Ballet Etudes of South Florida performs classical masterpieces, while the thrilling performances by Ballet Flamenco La Rosa capture the passion and spirit of flamenco.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1310,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Miami Beach</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When talking about Miami, the beach is the best place to start. In the 1940s, when vacationers began to arrive, Miami Beach was the center of the action. Although years have passed and times have changed, the beach remains a perennial hot spot. Enormous luxury resorts such as Fontainebleau and Eden Roc rise majestically against the skyline, shops and restaurants line the streets, and who could forget the miles of white sand beach?</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Beach</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once home to a number of retired citizens and struggling artists, South Beach has now risen to international fame as a popular vacation destination. Every block is packed with restaurants, bars, shops, and - of course - dance clubs, each trendier, more glamorous and cutting-edge than the last. One could spend days soaking in the sights and sounds of South Beach. Take a walking tour along Ocean Drive or down Lincoln Road, where the beautiful people come out to play. Whether it\''s three in the morning or three in the afternoon, there is bound to be plenty to do.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bal Harbour</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Located on the northern end of Miami Beach, Bal Harbour is the most exclusive neighborhood in Greater Miami. Luxury resorts sit serenely amid the lush foliage and palatial homes. No visit to this district is complete — or even begun — without a visit to the Bal Harbour Shops. Versace, Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Prada are just a few of the fashion houses that have retail outlets in this shopping center. Plenty of fine dining can be found in Bal Harbour as well. If you\''re on a budget, this isn\''t the place to dine or shop!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown Miami</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although primarily a business district, there\''s a lot to see and do in downtown. Tour the design district between Northeast 36th and 41st Streets, or check out the museums at the Metro-Dade Cultural Center. Shoppers will delight in the Bayside Marketplace with its retail shops, open-air crafts market, half-dozen restaurants, and pier. The Port of Miami is next to Bayside, where you can easily find a boat to take you on a tour around the bay.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Coconut Grove</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although this bustling district is one of the oldest in Miami, it seems to just be hitting its prime. Full of energy and creativity, the Grove is as busy as South Beach, but in a different way. Instead of attracting models and bodybuilders, it draws in artists, writers, and patrons of the arts. There are hundreds of fabulous shops and restaurants crammed within this small area, most of them located on the CocoWalk.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Coral Gables</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Coral Gables is a gated enclave crisscrossed by canals, just a few minutes\'' drive from Downtown Miami. This small, tree-lined village is home to many of Miami\''s most famous attractions, including the Biltmore Hotel, Venetian Pool and Miracle Mile. Excellent shopping and dining can be found on the Miracle Mile as well as on the side streets surrounding it.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Little Havana</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This area is located west of Brickell Avenue and runs along the thoroughfare known as Calle Ocho (Southwest 8th Street). Many immigrants and refugees from Cuba have settled here, along with natives of Colombia, Guatemala, Puerto Rico and other Latin American countries. It is in this district that you can enjoy authentic salsa music, indulge in a complete Cuban meal that\''s light on your wallet, or try a steaming cup of shockingly strong <em>café cubano</em> in an outdoor cafe.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Key Biscayne</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though located just over the Rickenbacker Causeway, Key Biscayne might as well be 1000 miles away. Things are different on this peaceful tropical island: the pace slows down, people are friendly and matter-of-fact. If the marvelous white sand beaches and varied leisure sports aren\''t enough reason to go, consider the prospect of kissing a dolphin at the Miami Seaquarium!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">West Miami</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">West Miami is a quieter, more residential area. It\''s spread out and almost impossible to sightsee without a car. Hialeah and Miami Lakes, two residential communities, are located in this area. The Miami International Airport is also situated here along with the Hialeah Park Racetrack.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Miami/Aventura</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While it may be slightly out of the way, Aventura is easy to reach even without a car, thanks to the shuttle buses that run regularly from the major downtown hotels to the Aventura Mall. The mall is well worth a day trip, as it boasts over 250 shops, restaurants and attractions. This district is also home to dozens of excellent restaurants, many of them specializing in \"Floribbean\" cuisine.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Broward County</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While Broward County is not officially a part of Miami, it might as well be — it\''s less than a half hour away. The thriving art community of Hollywood, the outlets at Sawgrass Mills and, last but not least, the decadent little city of Fort Lauderdale are a few possible destinations in Broward. The pace is slightly more relaxed than in Miami, but people are here to have fun, make no mistake about it. Enjoy the shops on Las Olas or dine in a restaurant that has its own private boat dock for guests traveling by water.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The locals strut the street in smart attire and daring outfits with as much poise as models on the runway. At the forefront of the latest trends and avant-garde fashion, Milan is a treasure trove for fashionistas and high-end shoppers. Most of the city\''s designer boutiques are clustered around the Quadrilatero d\''oro, edged in by Via della Spiga, Via Manzoni, Via Sant\''andrea and Via Montenapoleone. Milan is also home to the spectacular Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, one of the world oldest shopping malls and the abode of Prada\''s flagship store since 1913. You don\''t have to break the bank to shop in Milan, however. There are several excellent outlet stores that offer designer clothing with discounts of up to 70 percent on the original price. Il Salvagente and DMAG Outlet are a couple of the most popular, while hidden gems like the Basement cater almost exclusively to locals in the know. For alternative fashion, head to corso di Porta Ticinese, corso Vercelli or the Isola area, behind Stazione Garibaldi. High-street shopping can also be had at Corso Buenos Aires, via Torino or corso Vittorio Emanuele.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Milan has plenty to offer in terms of great entertainment, culture and art. The city is home to the famous Pinacoteca di Brera and the Museo Cenacolo Vinciano, which houses artifacts relating to the Leonardo Da Vinci\''s <em>Last Supper</em> as well as the famous painting itself. There are a host of museums spread out across the city. The Museum of Science and Technology is a definite must for boffins and future Einsteins., while the \"Museums of the Center\" cover a range of topics including everything from the Revival period at the Museo del Risorgimento to contemporary history at the Museo di Milano. Piazza Duomo itself has the Duomo Museum, filled with tapestries, stained glass, and clerical vestments. Milan is rich with history, and close to the center stands the Castello Sforzesco, which has interesting archaeological and numismatic collections. Also in the vicinity are the Palazzo Bagatti Valsecchi and Museo Poldi Pezzoli. Although, not quite as grand as the Castle, they are just as interesting, replete with displays of textiles, furnishings and artwork. There are several art galleries as well that celebrate the city\''s long-standing penchant for the fine arts, such as the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana , the Civica Galleria d\''arte Moderna, and the Padiglione d\''arte Contemporanea. Veritable shrines of art, these galleries showcase Italian masters alongside established contemporary artists and emerging talents through a diverse program of exhibitions.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater & Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\''re familiar with the world of classical theater and opera, one name is sure to spring to mind when you think of Milan: the world-famous Teatro alla Scala. Besides this legendary, historic venue, the city\''s principal theaters include the traditional Teatro San Babila, the Piccolo Teatro, founded by Strehler, and the Teatro Franco Parenti, which has devoted recent seasons to European culture. Milan has also recently rediscovered its passion for ballet and big-name musicals, such as <em>Singin\'' in the Rain</em>, <em>The Sound of Music</em> and the eternal <em>Rocky Horror Show</em>. Many of these are staged at the Teatro Ventaglio Nazionale. When it comes to classical music, the Teatro alla Scala and the Auditorium di Milano Fondazione Cariplo host performances by the symphony orchestra La Verdi, while the Conservatorio showcases lyrical concerts. more niche venues like the Nidaba Theatre and Blue Note cater to fans of jazz and blues music, adding diversity to the city\''s musical repertoire. Indie bars featuring local bands and underground acts, like Tunnel, are also aplenty.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Milan is a city that treasures cinematic brilliance and you\''ll find several multiplexes like the Colosseo and Eliseo that screen blockbusters and English films. For original language and foreign films, the Anteo SpazioCinema, Cinema Mexico and the Cinema Arcobaleno Film Center are top choices.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Milan has a lively, dynamic atmosphere day and night. The most crowded and trendiest nightspots are in the Brera, Ticinese and Navigli districts. Most of the fashionable bars are in Ticinese. In contrast,  Navigli is considered by some to be slightly retro, but is still adored by many; filled with lots of \"boho\" bars, it is just the place to go with a group of friends or in the company of your paramour. Brera and Isola are known as Milan\''s original hotspots; every bar here is fantastic. Glamor oozes from every door and this is a great area for an evening stroll. There is a huge amount of choice when it comes to clubs, discos, and bars. Friday is the day to go to Shocking Club and Hollywood is cool anytime, any day!</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Art lovers will also appreciate the Haggerty Museum of Art and the Villa Terrace Decorative Arts Museum.

The Shops of Grand Avenue is the city\''s premiere shopping center with over 50 stores and more than a dozen restaurants. The Bayshore Town Center is another upscale mall offering various shopping and dining options. There are bookstores, toy stores, and countless apparel stores. Brady Street, a thoroughfare near the Lower East Side is another excellent option for shopping. Lined with countless boutiques and specialty shops, visitors and locals alike are bound to find that perfect item.

This \"interactive improv experience\" has been hailed as one of the best comedy clubs around.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Milwaukee\''s most popular festival is Summerfest. This musical extravaganza is held every summer from late June to early July. Summerfest draws thousands of concert-goers as well as popular musical acts. It takes place over the course of 11 days on 11 stages and features 700 bands. Another popular festival is Irish Fest. Held every August, this festival aims to promote Irish culture. Held in September on Milwaukee\''s Lakefront, the Indian Summer Festival draws large crowds as well as talented musicians and artists. Thanks to great food, fireworks, and lots of family fun, Festa Italiana has continued to grow in popularity. It is the self-proclaimed premiere Italian cultural event in America. And, it is no surprise considering the city\''s large Polish community, that the Polish Fest, one of the city\''s many summer festivals, is in fact the country\''s largest Polish festival. Last but certainly not least is the Lakefront Festival on the Arts. This three-day festival is held every June along the shores of Lake Michigan. Many artists, both local and national, displays their works. Whether you\''re looking to buy that perfect piece of art or simply to browse, this is an enjoyable festival for the entire family.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whether you\''re looking for a friendly pub, a sleek lounge, or a pumping nightclub, Milwaukee has what you need. Popular pubs and taverns include Steny\''s Tavern & Grill, the Palm Tavern, and Mo\''s Irish Pub. All three offer a full menu as well as excellent brews. Some broadcast sporting events and host trivia nights as well as generous happy hours. Fluid is one of the city\''s most popular gay bars thanks to its inviting ambiance and its elaborate drink menu. For those who enjoy dressing to the nines and sipping snazzy martinis should head to Bryant\''s Cocktail Lounge for their splendid array of well-executed cocktails, or to Dock18. Kil@wat is another popular choice. Located inside the InterContinental Hotel, Kil@wat boasts an impressive drink list and a creative design. Milwaukee, home to a number of breweries, is unsurprisingly home to incredible beer-serving institutions like Burnhearts, where the Mitten Fest is held, and Sugar Maple, where a veritable menu of 60 taps dispensing craft beer await. For a more intense party scene, visit the Mad Planet where DJs spin alternative rock tracks and homespun bands perform live gigs, while the Hot Water & Wherehouse Night Club offers a more spacious venue for nighttime revelry. The 42 Lounge is a unique game-themed nightclub on Mason Street that organizes cosplay nights and serves gaming-inspired cocktails.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoors</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Aside from numerous summer festivals, notably Summerfest, Milwaukee offers a wide range of outdoor activities. The Milwaukee County Zoo offers excellent outdoor opportunities for tourists with families. One of the premier zoos in the country, this massive sits on 200 acres (80.93 hectares) and is home to 2500 animals of 300 different species. While Lake Michigan may be the city\''s first love when it comes to the outdoors, the city also boasts several lovely parks. Milwaukee County actually has 136 parks, the most notable being Lake Park. Designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the man behind New York\''s Central Park, Lake Park offers various sporting facilities, playgrounds and green space. Also worth noting is the Lakeshore State Park. This state park is small but picturesque as it runs along the shores of Lake Michigan. In the summer months it is the ideal spot for picnicking or sunbathing.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1337,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">East Town</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">East Town, the city\''s downtown area looks over the Milwaukee Bay. Water Street and Wisconsin Street, both located in the heart of East Town, are considered two of the city\''s liveliest streets. This area is also home to many historical buildings including City Hall, the Pabst Theater, the Iron Block Building, and the Mitchell Building as well as many other historic sites. St. Mary\''s Church, located on North Broadway Street is the city\''s oldest Catholic church. This church boasts a beautiful Annunciation painting located above the altar. The painting was actually a gift from King Ludwig I of Bavaria. Another church of interest is the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. While you\''re here, you can visit a few of the district\''s main attractions that are located within walking distance of one another, such as the Betty Brinn Children\''s Museum, the stunningly designed Milwaukee Art Museum with Georgia O\''keefe collections, the Milwaukee County War Memorial and Discovery World Milwaukee.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kilbourntown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kilbourntown, separated from Juneautown by the Milwaukee River, and part of the West Town district, was founded by Bryon Kilbourn, founder Solomon Juneau\''s rival. Kilbourn refused to align his bridges with those of Juneautown in the district of East Town, a decision that anyone who visits the city can see today. Kilbourntown is home to many large architectural projects. Today one will find the Riverside Theater (designed in Mediterranean Revival style), the Milwaukee Public Museum, the Milwaukee Public Library and the Shops of Grand Avenue. The Wisconsin Center and the Milwaukee County Courthouse are also located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Yankee Hill</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Yankee Hill, located a little to the north of East Town, exudes old-fashioned, high-end charm. This neighborhood was once owned by Solomon Juneau, the city\''s first mayor. It was therefore a hub for the city\''s government and business. Today visitors will find several beautiful churches as well as many lovely row houses designed in various styles including Victorian and Gothic. Two of the city\''s most beloved hotels, the Astor and the County Clare Irish Inn and Pub are located in Yankee Hill, and the neighborhood also hosts the annual summer jazz celebration in Cathedral Square Park, which lies between Yankee Hill and East Town. Yankee Hill is also home to Shank Hall, a small but popular local concert venue.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lower East Side</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Brady Street, this neighborhood\''s most prominent thoroughfare, is a bustling area near the Yankee Hill neighborhood. It had already become a commercial district by the 1880s. Once considered the city\''s version of Little Italy, Brady Street then became an example of New Urbanism thus attracting a slew of hipster-chic and bohemia-loving individuals. Following an effort to gentrify the area, Brady Street is now filled with cafés and boutiques, but it has still managed to maintain some of its eclectic, avant-garde flair. Aside from shopping and dining, the Apollo Café, St. Hedwig\''s Roman Catholic Church, a well-known Polish church built in 1871, the McIntosh-Goodrich Mansion and the Charles Allis Art Museum are also located on Lower East Side\''s Brady Street.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Northpoint/Upper East Side</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Northpoint, another lakefront community north of East Town stretches along the sinuous stretch of Bradford Beach and is one of Milwaukee\''s most scenic neighborhoods. The North Point Lighthouse, a 19th-century landmark lies a little ahead of the beach, and forms part of the verdant expanses of the sprawling Lake Park, where the eponymous golf course is also situated. To its south, the North Point Tower soars majestically above the city in Gothic Revival splendor, while the Villa Terrace Decorative Arts Museum nearby displays period antiquities at its idyllic lakefront location.Further north, the Upper East Side neighborhood is largely nondescript, and is predominantly known for its miscellany of religious landmarks.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">University District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the heart of this vibrant and youthful neighborhood is the University of Wisconsin, surrounded by a plethora of venues, university recreational halls and libraries that are all contained within a few miles of the Downer Woods Nature Area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Walker\''s Point</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Walker\''s Point has a slightly industrial yet hip feel as it encompasses many trendy warehouse-turned-lofts, art galleries, restaurants (notably Steny\''s Tavern & Grill), and nightclubs including several gay bars such as Fluid. The Allen-Bradley Clock Tower is one of Walker Point\''s most prominent landmarks.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Avenues West</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Avenues West, boasting such notable establishments as Marquette University, the St. Joan of Arc Chapel, the Haggerty Museum of Art, the Tripoli Shrine Temple, and the Captain Frederick Pabst Mansion refers to the area west of downtown. Once known for drug dealing and prostitution, the entire area has undergone some serious revamping. One of the city\''s most popular hotels, the Ambassador, is located in this neighborhood, and it, like the surrounding area, has regained its upscale reputation. In 1996 some human remains were unearthed leading the city to believe that this was the site of Milwaukee\''s first cemetery potentially dating back to Native American tribes.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Menomonee River Valley</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Much like Walker\''s Point, the Menomonee River Valley is a trendy neighborhood filled with hip lofts and funky establishments, most of which are former warehouses. It is not surprising that this neighborhood has attracted an increasing number of real estate developers. The area is frequented by a very bohemian, artsy crowd. The Menomonee River Valley\''s pride-and-joy is the Iron Horse Hotel, a state of the art boutique hotel that has been a fixture since 2008. It boasts the chic Branded bar/lounge and the trendy Smyth restaurant. The Menomonee River Valley\''s other famous resident is the Harley-Davidson Museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Brewer\''s Hill</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Brewer\''s Hill, named for its proximity to the former Schlitz Brewing Company and the Lakefront Brewery is one of the city\''s highest points of altitude. Considered a very family-friendly neighborhood, Brewer\''s Hill features a variety of architectural styles including Greek Revival and Queen Anne homes. While the neighborhood fell into a slump in the 1960s and 70s, it has subsequently been revitalized causing real estate prices to rise drastically.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Monterey Jazz Festival, that hoary but vibrant, three-day celebration of jazz, is held every September on multiple stages at the Monterey County Fairgrounds. The Monterey Blues Festival, in June, brings in heavyweights like B. B. King and Etta James at the same location. When those weekend-long musical extravaganzas close up shop for the year, the Monterey County Symphony\''s October-May series of concerts keeps toes a-tappin\''. The organization welcomes internationally renowned guest artists for a classics-based program, seasoned with choice works from the modern repertoire. They perform at the Sunset Cultural Center in Carmel. The very same venue also plays host to performances sponsored by Chamber Music Monterey Bay, which pulls in top small-group performers for its six-concert, winter-and-spring series.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Several fine repertory groups make Monterey\''s theater scene one of the better regional locales in the country. The Pacific Repertory Theatre puts on several plays each year from modern and classic playwrights at Carmel\''s Golden Bough Playhouse. Carmel\''s Carl Cherry Center for the Arts is a good place to catch a rotating program of dance and drama including productions by Monterey\''s own Unicorn Theatre. In Monterey, the Paperwing Theatre Company hosts local productions and spotlights Monterey talent in an intimate theater space.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wine</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though dwarfed by the winemaking powerhouse that is the Napa Valley, Monterey County has its share of respected vineyards and vintners. Accordingly, wine is quite the cultural force throughout the region. Here are some highlights: A Taste of Monterey\''s Cannery Row Bay View Tasting Room invites wine enthusiasts to sample a wide range of regional vintages, all in a comfortable setting with an unforgettable view. Soif Wine Bar offers an impressive selection of wines as well, this time alongside a delectable menu of contemporary Spanish cuisine. True die-hards will want to invest in the Santa Cruz Mountain Winegrowers Passport Program, a great way to see a variety of operations in action and sample the product! Another surefire way to get your fill is to attend the annual Monterey Wine Festival, a four-day bash involving lectures, tours, auctions, demonstrations, food, music and, of course, more tastings!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sometimes, Monterey can feel a bit like old London. Maybe it\''s the fog, maybe it\''s the quaint little streets—or <em>maybe</em> it\''s the plethora of bona fide British-style pubs lining the streets. Saunter into any one of them and you\''ll be sure to stumble out after some pints, some shots, some darts and a hearty dinner of bangers and mash. Of all of them, the Crown & Anchor has been voted \"Most Authentic,\" and its heated outdoor patio keeps locals and travelers coming back for more. The Mucky Duck, in a Spanish-style adobe building built in 1924, also has a cozy outdoor patio, as well as 60 single-malt scotch options. The Monterey branch of the beloved regional chain Britannia Arms keeps patrons busy with raucous trivia contests and karaoke nights. Down near Fisherman\''s Wharf, find your way into the London Bridge Pub, right on the waterfront. Choose from more than 60 beers from all over the world. At Bulldog British Pub, when you tire of ales and lagers, be sure to get yourself a \''red Silk Knickers\''—if only because it\''s fun to order.Cannery Row is a great spot to enjoy a night out. Here, bars and cafes are packed in an easily explored 13-block radius and offer everything from salsa to live music and comedy nights. The craft brewing craze is strong here, and there are plenty of brewpubs where you can sample local drafts.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Family Fun and Outdoor Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Monterey Area is great for a fun-packed family vacation. The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a top choice for all ages, while whale watching on Fisherman\''s Wharf, kayaking tours where you can spot seals, hiking, horseback riding with the Monterey Bay Equestrian Center are a few more fun outdoor activities visitors will enjoy.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Monterrey and its surrounding towns provide plenty of opportunity to indulge in some shopping. While the downtown district is home to Alvarado Street, a street lined with indie boutiques and local shops, Cannery Row, a vibrant waterfront street, is the place for souvenirs and specialty items like wine and antiques. Further afield, a short drive from the city, Carmel-by-the-Sea is a well recognized art haven where collectors can go and check out the artists studio\''s for themselves.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Steinbeck</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">What would a trip to this region be without a fitting remembrance of John Steinbeck, author of such bestsellers as <em>East of Eden</em> and <em>The Winter of Our Discontent</em>? The National Steinbeck Center in Salinas, and its annual Steinbeck Festival do a great job. The Center has comprehensively cataloged every pertinent piece of information from every nook and cranny of the esteemed writer\''s life. The Festival draws revelers from all over the world, offering a celebratory look into the history of the Salinas Valley and its favorite son. If Salinas is a little too out of the way, simply take a stroll down Cannery Row, being mindful to read between the lines and imagine the place as it once was (before the candy shops and theme bars). Who knows: perhaps you\''ll stumble into some forgotten little alleyway where days gone by are still faintly palpable. If not, try Steinbeck\''s Spirit of Monterey Wax Museum. Wax museums may be a hokey concept, but this one is filled with nothing but waxy depictions of the life and times (and imaginings) of one Mr. J.E. Steinbeck III.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1347,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Monterey\''s carefully restored downtown is, in fact, the historical cradle of California. From 1775, when it became the capital of the Spanish colony of Alta California, through Mexican rule and the brief period of independent California, the whole state was governed from Monterey. Landmarks from each of these periods are preserved in the adobe Colonial-style houses that line the streets of the district. Monterey State Historic Park, though it has seen fit to join the Wi-Fi revolution, is still probably the best place to catch a glimpse of the olden days. Historic buildings and pleasant gardens are the name of the game here, and the site plays host to historical reenactments and festivals such as the Monterey Living History Festival every Independence Day, and Christmas in the Adobes. If you\''re in Downtown Monterey in February, and you\''re in a festival-going frame of mind, take in A Day of Romance in Old Monterey, a decidedly romantic celebration of the town\''s history. If you\''re in the mood to survey something other than California history, downtown is also the place to immerse yourself in pub life. The Crown & Anchor, Britannia Arms will keep you in suds all night.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fisherman\''s Wharf</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Within walking distance from downtown is Fisherman\''s Wharf, an often-visited leftover from Monterey\''s days as a Spanish colonial capital, cargo facility, whaling station and port. Now it\''s home to some commendable seafood restaurants like Cafe Fina and more than a few lovely gift shops. Try Carousel Candies for some homemade sweet treats, or The Wharf\''s General Store for just about everything else. Marine tours of Monterey Bay, including whale-watching trips, leave from the wharf frequently. Chris\'' Fishing Trips and MB Whale Watching are two popular choices.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cannery Row</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A mile down the coast from the Wharf is Cannery Row, a world-class tourist destination all its own. The bulk of its shops, restaurants and bars are housed inside historic former sardine-packing factories, so this serves as a dramatic reminder of the hard life depicted in John Steinbeck\''s epic novel about the neighborhood. The area is crammed with gift shops like The Garlic Shoppe and other attractions such as Steinbeck\''s own Spirit of Monterey Wax Museum, many of which give tourists quite a bit of historical and cultural bang for their buck. Many of the district\''s restaurants rank among the best in the Monterey Bay Area. Grab an award-winning steak at the Whaling Station Steakhouse, or scarf some Italian-accented seafood at Massaro & Santos. Cannery Row\''s biggest attraction, and the primary reason for its resurgence as a tourist destination is the aquarium. Arguably the finest aquarium in the world, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is as good as it is not only because of its imaginative presentation and great funding, but also because it focuses its attention on what is just outside, in the deep waters of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. You will see otters at play, a towering kelp forest, trance-inducing jellyfish, the world\''s largest aquarium window—and you can even pet a velvety Bat Ray.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pacific Grove</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">West of Monterey along Ocean View Boulevard lies the cozy seaside community of Pacific Grove. Three hundred and fifty-five days out of the year, Pacific Grove is as quiet a town as one could hope to find, with tree-lined streets fronting small quaint houses. The mix of Spanish adobe construction with Victorian accents is irresistible. But in November, a peaceful madness descends; Pacific Grove truly becomes the \"City of the Butterflies\" as hundreds of thousands of monarch butterflies stop off on their annual migration. Many of Pacific Grove\''s historic Victorian mansions have found new life as renowned bed and breakfasts like the Martine or the Centrella, and others as noteworthy restaurants such as Fandango. This is also the site of the Julia Morgan-designed Asilomar Conference Grounds, situated amongst the Asilomar State Park dunes at the foot of the Pacific Ocean and its dramatically crashing surf.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

But French is only one of 35 or so languages you will hear on the streets of this international island city of 1.6 million inhabitants.Demographics show that Montreal residents come from 80 countries, forming an urban mosaic of vibrant ethnic communities and neighborhoods safe to walk in day or night. Visitors will detect a distinct British influence in parts of the city, inherent in the culture since the days when English merchants controlled the city\''s trade. All in all, it\''s easy to see why \''cosmopolitan\'' is the adjective most used in describing Montreal.  Characteristically, there\''s the famous <em>joie de vivre</em> - the ineffable combination of spirit and ambiance Montrealers exude without even trying. You will see it in the summertime cappuccino-sippers cramming sidewalk cafés; in the long lines outside Schwartz\''s, home to the city\''s best smoked meat; and in the lovers holding hands on Mount Royal, the city\''s parkland mountain rising 264 meters (866 feet) above the ground. The same spirit can even be felt on an outdoor skating rink in the dead of winter, in the tuxedo-ed crowd listening raptly to the Montreal Symphony Orchestra (Orchestre symphonique de Montréal), or when hockey fanatics at the Bell Centre scream and pump their fists in unison with every Montreal Canadiens goal. The island of Montreal sits at the confluence of three rivers: the mighty St. Lawrence, the Rivière des Prairies and the Ottawa. Montrealers describe their streets as going north-south and east-west, but the island itself is askew, tilted to the northeast.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Traditionally known as the center of Montreal\''s Anglophone nightlife, they are now known mostly for their numerous dance clubs/meat markets (Winnie\''s being one of the most famous). Those in search of a more sedate pint in the area can find one at the Irish pub Hurley\''s, the charming Brutopia brew-up, and at numerous other places that are popular among an older, English-speaking crowd.  The Boulevard Saint-Laurent is the city\''s most famous street, as it is the traditional dividing line between the city\''s English and French-speaking areas. Nowadays, booze serves as a very effective <em>lingua franca,</em> especially on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, when things don\''t cool down until dawn. The strip between rue Prince-Arthur and Mont-Royal Avenue features dozens of pubs, clubs, bars and assorted other dives that defy generalization.  In the latter category are the Bifteck and Sir Winston Churchill Pub, two friendly, endearing, impossibly smoky taverns attracting a mixture of students and 20-somethings. Cut a rug at the Belmont sur le Boulevard, lounge among the hipsters at Tokyo, or just enjoy the quiet serenity of Else\''s, an arty but unpretentious pub full of Plateau-dwellers. It\''s all within a 20-minute walk around the Boulevard Saint-Laurent.  You can complete a similar if somewhat less bohemian pub crawl on St-Denis Street, St-Laurent\''s more French, polished cousin, located one major street to the east. The action on St-Denis is clustered around Ontario Street in the Latin Quarter (Quartier Latin), where mind-boggling bars such as the Saint-Sulpice compete with the quieter allure of pubs such as l\''ile Noire, Cheval Blanc, Pub Quartier Latin and the Sainte-Élisabeth. The funky, eclectic bars and cafés situated farther north between Rue Rachel and Avenue Mont-Royal attract a suitably diverse crowd: check out Barouf, Quai des Brumes and Bily Kun. This street is home to dozens of patios (or terraces, in local parlance) that are perfect for watching the world go by.  For those unwilling or unable to go softly into the night, after-hours clubs such as Stereo Nightclub will let you stay until at least 10a on Saturday or Sunday morning.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums & Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Of course, Montreal is more than a university town on a bender. Museums, galleries, theater, cinema and unclassified fringe elements enjoy great public interest from a citizenry for whom the arts represent an integral component of having a good time. An impressive if not overwhelming collection of the European masters awaits visitors at the Musem of Fine Arts, whose magnificent premises also host first-class touring exhibitions. The Museum of Modern Art, itself an amazing building, offers a fascinating glimpse into Quebec\''s thriving community of modern artists. There are also dozens of smaller galleries, museums and exhibition spaces that dot the cityscape and remain relatively undiscovered by tourists.  The Canadian Centre for Architecture (Centre Canadien d\''architecture) presents exhibitions and multimedia displays that range from the straightforward to the thoroughly bizarre, and as a result has gained a worldwide reputation.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Montreal is at the center of the province\''s vibrant cinema community, as evidenced by its fine repertory houses and state-of-the-art first-run theaters. The Scotiabank Theatre Montréal offers stadium seating, state-of-the-art sound and IMAX screens. The Cinéma du Parc, an indie theater spread out over two floors, showcases an impressive program of rare Canadian and international films. Montreal also hosts the Festival International Nouveau Cinéma every autumn. That\''s just one of the festivals Montreal has to offer. Other film fests include the World Film Festival, International Festival of Films on Art and FANT-ASIA. The Just For Laughs Festival is a joyous yearly tradition, while locals flock downtown to Place des Arts for the outdoor shows associated with the Montreal International Jazz Festival and the FrancoFolies .</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater and Concerts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater buffs will find both English and French productions in the city. Well-known companies include the Centaur, whose program features in-house Canadian and international dramas; the predominantly French Infinithéâtre; and the National Theatre School, which hosts occasional presentations. Many smaller companies exist in the city, and though some are ethnically oriented, most enjoy a pleasantly diverse audience.  The Place des Arts is home to the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the Les Grands Ballets Canadiens and l\''opéra de Montréal.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1366,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Main (La Main)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Splitting the city in half, both physically and personality-wise, is Saint Laurent Boulevard - The Main, as it is affectionately known. It is here where waves of immigrants first settled upon their arrival in the New World. Reminders of the past still abound in family-run Polish delis tucked beside upscale restaurants and in dollar stores located next door to swank billiard emporiums. This is ground zero for the city\''s addresses (streets number east and west from St-Laurent) and, historically, this was the demarcation line between English and French Montreal, with the French predominating to the east and the English to the west.  These days, the dividing line is no longer completely rigid, but there are still distinct English and French areas. You will find the English restaurant and bar scene concentrated on Bishop Street and Crescent Street; the French on St-Denis Street and areas east in the Latin Quarter (Quartier Latin) and Gay Village. The traditional French residential areas are tightly packed districts that stretch all the way to the Olympic Park and Hochelaga-Maisonneuve; English becomes more noticeable as you move west, culminating in the affluent suburb of Westmount.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Old Montreal (Vieux-Montréal)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the southern end of St-Laurent Boulevard, lies the historic district of Old Montreal, a major tourist attraction with its cobblestone streets, horse-drawn calèche rides and Old Port (Vieux-Port) activities. This is where in 1642, the city\''s first European settlers staked their claim to a land they thought was theirs by divine right. You can still see the remnants of their original fortifications, and you can check out artifacts from the period at the Montreal History Centre as well as the Pointe-à-Callière Museum of archeology and history. Also found here are the oldest buildings in Montreal, with some, such as the Sainte-Sulpice Seminary, dating back to the late 17th Century.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Montreal Islands</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Across the St-Lawrence River, the Expo 67 islands of Ste-Hélène and Notre-Dame still glitter from when Montreal hosted the World\''s Fair in 1967. Today the site is home to La Ronde amusement park, the Gilles Villeneuve Racetrack (Circuit Gilles Villeneuve) and Montreal\''s world-class Casino.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Plateau Mont-Royal</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the other end of The Main is the Plateau Mont-Royal neighborhood, unusual in that it encompasses both ethnic shops and restaurants on Parc Avenue as well as the hip Francophone crowd along St-Denis Street. This is Canada\''s most densely populated area, and its smaller streets, with their winding staircases and small BYOW (bring your own wine) restaurants, remain a picture of true Montreal life.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Little Italy (Petite Italie)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just a little further north and you will hear Italian spoken on Montreal\''s streets over in the city\''s own Little Italy, the original home of the first Italian immigrants and now one of the liveliest areas in the city with its espresso bars, boutiques and authentic Italian cuisine.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Underground City (RÉSO)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">No visit to Montreal is complete without a visit to the Underground City - Montreal-above-ground has been described as the tip of the urban iceberg. Beneath it lies the world\''s most extensive system of interconnected pedestrian and Metro (subway) networks, linking buildings, boutiques, restaurants and even residential apartments. You could spend an entire winter in this subterranean city without ever once having to face the cold or snow.  The Metro system itself has lines running east-west and north-south (albeit, askew) to just about every part of the city. While you are down there, check out the 68 architecturally unique stations, each created by a different designer.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

The Bol\''shoi Theatre is a world-renowned institution and the jewel of Moscow\''s cultural nightlife. The performances, as well as the auditorium, are immaculate. In terms of grandeur, the Bol\''shoi surpasses anything else in Russia. It is a popular venue, especially among visiting tourists, and tickets may be difficult to find at short notice. Other major venues include the Kremlin Palace of Congresses (State Kremlin Palace), a modern building within the walls of the Kremlin that hosts performances of great Russian ballets. Both the Stanislavskii and Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theater and the Helikon Theater in Arabt run a variety of Russian and foreign classics, with the latter taking a more innovative approach. For the city\''s best orchestral music, visit the Tchaikovskii Concert Hall and the Tchaikovskii Conservatory.While classical concerts generally rule the roost in the city, contemporary concert shows are not uncommon either. The Olympic Stadium that dominates the Olimpiyskiy Prospekt has played host to several big-ticket concerts in the past.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Modern Moscow may be a commercial epicenter, but theater and the arts still find a special role in the city life. The breadth and range of drama theaters rival those of most major capitals.The Moscow Art Theater has always been among the city\''s most prominent theater companies, of which there are now two branches. The original, Chekhov Moscow Art Theater (MKhAT - Moskovskii Khudozhestvennyi Teatr imeni A. Chekhova), is reputed to be the best. The Theater on Taganka was a politically controversial theater during Soviet times. It is famous for its veiled satires.For classic Russian drama, head to the Maly Theatre, founded in 1824. It continues to produce material predominantly from the 19th Century. The same is true for the Sovremennik Theater. Contemporary works are favored by a few theaters, most notably the Maiakovskii Theater and the Lenkom Theater. The Lenkom is the birthplace of the Russian rock-opera.You\''ll find alternative theater productions offered up at the Obraztsov Puppet Theater (Teatr Kukol imeni Obraztsova) and the Moscow Clown Theater (Moskovskii Teatr Klounady).</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Art Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Moscow features a staggering capacity of museums, especially those featuring impressive collections of artworks. Among the most notable include the Tretyakov Gallery and the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, two of the most premier galleries of fine art, the world over. The Multimedia Art Museum and the incredible Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Gorky Park are some of the most eminent repositories of modern art in the country. The Art Gallery of the European and American Countries of the XIX-XX centuries is home to an invaluable collection of 19th and 20th Century American and European artworks. Apart from art museums, Moscow also houses a wide berth of history, military and other specialty museums that cannot be possibly covered in a short time. Ranging from one of Moscow\''s oldest museums, the Kremlin Armoury and the regal Tsarytsino Open-Air History and Architectural Museum, to the Kolomenskoye, the Space Museum and the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center, Moscow\''s phenomenal grip over history and culture can be summed up in the exhibits displayed at these institutions. Other smaller, yet noteworthy museums include the State Historical Museum, the Victory Museum and the Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Kinoteatr Pioner in Moscow not only hosts film screenings, but also regular film festivals of mainstream movies as well as art-house cinema. There is also a cafe on site that serves a variety of European treats. 5 Zvezd in Novokuznetskaya screens Hollywood blockbusters, albeit some screenings may include dubbed versions. The CDK, or the Documentary Film Center located in Park Kulturi, is a film buffs\'' haven and a city treasure. For Russian movies, visit the Illuzion.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightclubs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Moscow is home to some of the world\''s most fiercely fashionable clubs. Gogol, one of the city\''s oldest clubs operates as a restobar during the day, and transforms into an atmospheric club come night. London, another nightclub on Prospekt Vernadskogo, has been captivating crowds since 2008, while Icon, a wildly popular celeb haunt, is one of the city\''s best and biggest. Other dynamic clubs in the city include Propaganda and Krysha Mira, an uber-chic club set on the Moskva River. 16 tonnes is a good place to hear live music, as is the Esse Jazz Club.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Moscow is studded with a wonderful assemblage of malls, department stores and shopping zones that offer a bevy of retail options. Start at its beautiful markets and shopping streets to get the best of local flavor and acquaint yourself with regional treasures. The Izmailovsky Market, a bargain-friendly market, sells everything from art to antiquities, while Arbat Street famously overflows with souvenir shops. Moscow\''s malls are equally famous as well, from the versatile offerings at the Evropeisky Shopping Center, to endless brands and outlets at the GUM and TSUM department stores, and the Okhotny Ryad Shopping Center. One of Moscow\''s most historic shopping sites can be found at Petrovsky Passage, a classy department store that stretches across from the Red Square.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1376,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Red Square and the Kremlin</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Visiting Moscow is best in late spring or autumn when the weather is warm and sunny, and there is simply no better place to begin your exploring than its historic heart: the Red Square (Krasnaia Ploshchad\''). Much of Russia\''s turbulent history has played out either in public on the Red Square itself or in private behind the walls of the Kremlin (Kreml\''). The Kremlin is a powerful mix of church and state, of European and Russian styles, and of historic and modern-day Russia. The Red Square is an impressive and famous city square separating the Kremlin from the city\''s merchant center. Entering from the north end past the State Historical Museum, you will instantly recognize the multi-colored onion domes of St. Basil\''s Cathedral (Sobor Vasiliia Blazhennogo) looming on the far side of the square. To the left of the square is the vast edifice that is the GUM department store and down on the right are the towering walls of the Kremlin. Beneath the walls sits Lenin\''s Mausoleum, a step-pyramid structure housing the embalmed remains of Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kitai-Gorod</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">By and large a thriving commercial area, Kitai-Gorod incorporates the broad area east of Red Square. Kitai is encircled by reconstructed medieval walls and separated from the Kremlin by the Red Square. The area is a unique demonstration of architectural history. It is a mix of traditional, Art Nouveau and monumental Soviet-era architecture. Nestled between sights are the remnants of richly decorated churches and mansions. Notable examples include the well-preserved 17th-century Tserkov Troitsy v Nikitinkakh (Church of the Trinity in Nikitinov) and the Romanov Boyar House in Zariadie (Muzei Palaty v Zariade), the former home of Romanov boyars. Gradually, beginning in the 19th Century, it was transformed into a commercial center with banks, shops and businesses.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bulvarnoe Kol\''tso & Sadovoye Kol\''tso</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Moscow sits on the banks of the Moskva River and its road system is centered around its heart, the Kremlin. The road system is an intricate circular system of roads, which forms rings around the Kremlin. The first, innermost ring is known as the Bulvarnoe Kol\''tso, (Boulevard Ring). The Bulvarnoe Kol\''tso was built on the former site of a 16th-century city wall. Despite its name, the Boulevard is not a full ring, but more of an arc shape. The Boulevard Ring extends from Cathedral of Christ the Savior (Khram Khrista Spasitela) to the Yauza River. North of the Bulvarnoe Kol\''tso is a hugely varied and rolling area encompassing many of Moscow\''s main sights and attractions, including the Bol\''shoi Theatre.The Sadovoye Kol\''tso (Garden Ring), also known as B Route, is the second circular avenue consisting of about 17 streets and 15 squares. The buildings along Sadovoye Kolt\''so are eclectic, from a 19th-century mansion to recently constructed shopping malls. While under the rule of Stalin, the ring underwent construction, yet no part was rebuilt in the Stalinist style. The western side of this arched area was once one of the city\''s fashionable districts. Several famous names resided here, and many of their former homes have now become tourist attractions such as the Tolstoi House-Museum and the Pushkin Museum on the Arbat among others. The area around the Arbat and Novi Arbat used to be a thriving zone for Soviet Bohemians.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The North</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the north of the Garden Ring, you\''ll begin to get a sense of the dizzying size of Moscow; the vast residential districts stretch north as far as the eye can see. There are many sights here that are worth checking out, including the All-Russian Exhibition Center, the nearby Botanical Gardens and the Ostankino Television Tower. Closer to the center, there are a handful of nice museums such as the Dostoevsky Apartment Museum and the Glinka State Central Museum of Musical Culture.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Of The City Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Immediately south of the Moskva River is the State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow\''s foremost gallery of Russian art. The famous Gorky Park is also located here, not far from the controversial Monument to Peter the Great (Monument Petry Velikomu). Farther south, lies the Tsaritsyno.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The East</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Taganka Square is filled with palaces and churches built by Moscow\''s former social elite to the east, now surrounded by extensive residential development. It is home to the famous Theatre on Taganka. Other sights include the Andronikov Monastery and the Pomorskaya Old Believers Commune of Moscow.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The West</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The White House (Belyi Dom) on the River Moskva, has profound cultural and political significance in Russia\''s Post-Soviet history. Over the river resides the memorial Victory Park (Park Pobedy), commemorating the victory over fascism and Nazism in the \"Great Patriotic War,\" World War II. Farther south (and back over the twisting river) you\''ll find the famous Novodevichy (New Maiden) Convent and Cemetery. The cemetery houses the graves of famous Russian authors Anton Chekhov and Mikhail Bulgakovlikes, among other notable Russians. From there across the river, you\''ll see the imposing presence of Moscow State University\''s Main Building.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

As well as staging ambitious concerts, the Nationaltheater with its cast of world class soloists, the Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz and the Prinzregententheater feature outstanding productions of opera, operetta, musical and ballet.  With a capacity of almost 14,000 the Olympia-Halle, along with the slightly smaller Rudi-Sedelmayer-Halle, host the big events in pop and rock. Other popular venues include Zenith, a repurposed railway repair yard. Friends of jazz shouldn\''t miss the Unterfahrt, Muffathalle and Wirtshaus zum Isartal jazz clubs.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater and Cabaret</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There is a vast choice in theater with both sides of Maximilianstraße marking the battleground in the eternal competition for spectators and high quality productions between the Bayerisches Staatsschauspiel (its venues include the Residenztheater, the Cuvilliéstheater and the Marstall) and the Kammerspiele. Apart from that, there are more light-hearted venues such as the Komödie im Bayerischen Hof, small stages like the Metropol-Theater and even smaller ones such as the Theater am Sozialamt. Contemporary and experimental drama can be seen at the Freie Theater while slightly crazy blend of opera, operetta, musical, ballet, drama and comedy is on offer at the Pasinger Fabrik.  Munich holds a unique position in the history of German political satire. This great tradition is still represented at the Lach- und Schießgesellschaft. The stars of political stand-up, the comedy scene\''s modern day equivalent to satirical revues, appear at the Lustspielhaus.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinemas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Visitors will find an abundance of cinemas spread over all parts of the city. Currently the most modern multiplex is CineMaxX at Isartor, the most impressive are Filmtheater Sendlinger Tor and Arri-Kino.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As a consequence of having been the royal residence of the art-loving Bavarian kings, Munich has inherited a rich legacy in the way of art. The Alte Pinakothek exhibits European paintings and sculpture dating from the 14th to 18th Centuries, while fine arts from the 18th and 19th Centuries are shown next door at the Neue Pinakothek. The Pinakothek der Moderne was inaugurated in 2002 after a lengthy seven year construction period. The massive museum is characterized by its concrete rectilinear facade, and features four collections in each of its corners - art, design, architecture, and works on paper. The Staatsgalerie is part of the Haus der Kunst whose constantly changing temporary exhibitions attract many visitors. The most famous of Munich\''s museums is the Deutsches Museum situated on an island in the river Isar. Visitors to the museum are taken on a vivid and spectacular voyage through the history of human technology, from its early beginnings into the future. The Museum Mensch und Natur at Nymphenburg Castle is also well worth the visit. The Bayerisches Nationalmuseum documents the culture, art and technology of Bavaria. The Münchner Stadtmuseum (Munich City Museum) lies at the cultural heart of Munich.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the event that a day in Munich wasn\''t enough to wear you out completely, the city also offers a wide range of nightclubs and bars to spend the hours until breakfast. Since the Swinging Sixties, Schwabing has been Munich\''s entertainment center and even today, small theaters, cabarets, cinemas, pubs and bars congregate in this area. In the streets around Münchner Freiheit and Glockenbachviertel the local youth mix with tourists from all over the world. Top choices include Hofbrauhaus Munchen for a classic Bavarian brewery experience, Backstage for live music for those seeking an alternative vibe, and Cocktail House for a more intimate evening.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1394,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Altstadt</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Munich\''s historic city center lies between Karlstor, Isartor, Sendlinger Tor and Odeonsplatz. Splendid neo-baroque buildings stand in the shadows of futuristic glass and steel constructions. For an excellent view of the city, climb to the top of Alter Peter (St. Peter), affectionately known by locals as \"Old Peter.\" The historic center also boasts numerous other churches, including the Asamkirche, Theatinerkirche and Dreifaltigkeitskirche, as well as the city\''s most distinctive landmark, the twin-towered Frauenkirche. Street performers entertain the crowds at Marienplatz, but everyone\''s attention is immediately drawn to the show on the town hall\''s bell tower when it begins to chime. Unarguably, the jewel in the crown is the Residenz, the former royal palace on Odeonsplatz, complete with the stunning Hofgarten. Visitors can also take a stroll around Viktualienmarkt.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Schwabing</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Countess of Revenlow once said that \"Schwabing isn\''t a place, it\''s a state of mind.\" Once home to colonies of artists, bohemians and other alternative types, Schwabing is now teeming with affluent young professionals. But don\''t be fooled, this part of town has many different faces. Visitors can admire the regal magnificence of 19th-century Munich on Ludwigstraße, home of the university and numerous Bavarian government ministries, while the ultra-modern, high-tech city is clearly visible in the area behind the Siegestor. Leopoldstraße, lined with cinemas, bars, restaurants and shops, is the place to see and be seen. The splendid art nouveau buildings in many of the side streets are a mecca for architecture lovers and a feast for the eye. The alternative and revolutionary atmosphere can still be felt in the area around Münchener Freiheit, and if you fancy visiting a museum, then look no further—this is where the majority of Munich\''s museums are located.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bogenhausen</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Beginning at the Friedensengel on the River Isar, Prinzregentenstraße leads into the heart of Bogenhausen. With ostentatious streets lined with ornate villas, this part of town simply oozes wealth. The area around Arabella park in the north of Bogenhausen has become a symbol of the German economic wonder: mammoth, futuristic 1950s constructions make you feel positively lilliputian.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Haidhausen</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Otherwise known as the \"French quarter,\" Haidhausen is the personification of continental <em>savoir vivre</em>. With its variety of architectural styles and patchwork of multicultural and multi-talented individuals, this district is brimming with creative spirit. It is also the perfect place to embark upon a culinary trip around the world. Don\''t overlook the Müllersches Volksbad, a beautiful Roman-style swimming pool.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Englischer Garten</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you haven\''t fallen in love with Munich yet, then you will when you see the English Gardens. The lush lawns, romantic hideaways and boisterous beer gardens offer something for everyone. Sun worshipers can improve their tan at the Eisbach, tea lovers can take part in a traditional tea ceremony at the Japanese tea house, while others may prefer to savor that inimitable \"Munich feeling\" in the beer garden near the Chinese Tower. The view from the Monopterus—a former haunt of the flower power generation—is well worth seeing. This inner-city oasis is a must for visitors with a bit of time on their hands.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nymphenburg</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tired of the hustle and bustle of city life? Then it\''s time to visit Schloss Nymphenburg, a picturesque castle with Parisian-style gardens and ponds full of water lilies, graceful swans and well-fed carp. A favorite meeting place for lovers and families alike, it\''s also worth wandering around the streets to admire the traditional town houses. A drink or two in Café Palmenhaus is the perfect way to round off the day.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sendling</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A typical industrial area, Sendling is also \"Munich\''s belly,\" housing the legendary fruit and vegetable market, one of the largest in Europe. The market begins at 5a and is well worth a visit. But if that sounds like an unreasonably early start, you could check out the fascinating Jewish Cemetery which contains eight centuries worth of tombs.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theresienwiese</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Under the watchful gaze of the statue of Bavaria, hundreds of thousands of revelers meet here every September for the world-famous Oktoberfest, when the autumn air is filled with the aroma of pretzels, sausages and, of course, beer! This unmissable event has a certain unifying force, with tourists and Bavarians, punks and business people all clanking glasses, swaying to the beat of the oompah bands and dancing on the tables. Quench your thirst with a quart of beer and flaunt your <em>Dirndl</em> and <em>Lederhosen</em>!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Olympic Park</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Built for the 1972 Olympic Games, the Olympic complex initially aroused a great deal of controversy but is now an integral part of Munich\''s cityscape. Crowned by the magnificent Olympic Stadium—former home of Bayern Munich FC and their lesser-known local rival 1860 Munich—this part of town is southern Germany\''s undisputed center of sport and entertainment. As well as a variety of sports stadiums, the complex also includes a vast entertainment center, the Olympiahalle, venue for big-name concerts by the likes of U2 and the Rolling Stones. Shortly after the 1972 Games, the Olympic Village was converted into a colorful student residence, and now accommodates some 9,000 students on the cheap.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Myrtle Beach Pelicans baseball team, Class A affiliates of the Atlanta Braves, play at the TicketReturn.com Field in Myrtle Beach.

As you enter South Carolina from North Carolina, this small village greets you with bright skies, beautiful flowers that bloom all year, sparkling ocean and majestic oak trees. Shops, restaurants, golf courses and retirement communities have sprung up in the last ten years, but Little River has managed to maintain a less hectic pace than the rest of Myrtle Beach.  Little River\''s biggest event is the annual Blue Crab Festival. Held in May on the weekend after Mother\''s Day, many visitors return for the fresh crab and other seafood, a juried art show, arts and crafts of all descriptions, face painting for the children, boat rides, and live entertainment.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Myrtle Beach</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">North Myrtle Beach consists of the four communities of Cherry Grove, Ocean Drive, Crescent Beach and Windy Hill where Barefoot Landing has become a popular shopping, eating, and entertainment spot.  Crossing the expansive bridge over the Intercoastal Waterway from Little River to North Myrtle Beach is an experience in itself. Steal a quick view of the houses, boats, marinas and bridges for miles in either direction — if you\''re not driving, that is.  In Cherry Grove, you\''ll find one of the most popular destinations of both residents and visitors alike, the Cherry Grove Fishing Pier. The pier extends 985 feet into the ocean and has a 2-tier viewing deck with a dynamic view of North Myrtle Beach. The pier attracts the casual and \''serious\'' angler, and residents and visitors alike.  The other three communities in North Myrtle Beach are not as large or as developed as Cherry Grove, but they also have beautiful beaches and plenty of accommodations. North Myrtle Beach\''s population has mushroomed since 1990; consequently, so have the development and the traffic. From late April through early September, allow plenty of time to get down Route 17, the main thoroughfare from Little River all the way to Charlestown.  Beach and Boogie Music is king at the Beach Clubs like Fat Harold\''s Beach Club in Ocean Drive. This thumping, rhythmic music will have you dancing in your seat, if you\''re not up doing the \"Shag,\" the official dance of South Carolina. Notoriously described as \"the jitterbug on Valium,\" the Shag is fun to watch and even more fun to try.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Arcadian Shores</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On your way from North Myrtle Beach to Myrtle Beach, Arcadian Shores offers a coastal retreat. This neighborhood is famed for its excellent resorts and is closed to Restaurant Row, making it the ideal home base for any vacation. For golf enthusiasts, the Arcadian Shores Golf Club is the perfect place to challenge yourself on a course designed by famed architect Rees Jones.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Myrtle Beach, the City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once you visit Myrtle Beach and see the overwhelming number of hotels, motels, condominiums, restaurants and attractions, you will find it hard to believe that most of the development took place since the late 1950s. Getting to Myrtle Beach is easy thanks to the modern and efficient Myrtle Beach Airport. Once you get there, though, finding your way around can be tricky until you get the hang of the system used to number the roads. The roads are very crowded, but the city managers are dealing with the congestion by adding new roads. Veteran\''s Highway (Route 22) helps you avoid a large part of Route 17. Route 501, the other main highway, swings off of Route 17 to the west and leads to many of the popular golf courses.  Myrtle Beach has its own baseball team, the Pelicans, a Class A affiliate of the Atlanta Braves. The games are held at TicketReturn.com Field, a relatively small stadium from which you can clearly see all the action on the field. Silly games and contests held in between innings and Splash, the mascot, make going to the games a fun time for all ages.  Myrtle Beach has just about any kind of entertainment you can think of, such as The Carolina Opry, Medieval Times Dinner & Tournament, IMAX Discovery Theatre, Hard Rock Café, Ripley\''s Aquarium, water parks, nightclubs and shopping galore. There are also many annual festivals that bring visitors back year after year. As they say, \"If you\''re bored in Myrtle Beach, it\''s your own fault.\"</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Southern Grand Strand</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This southern part of the Grand Strand moves at a more leisurely pace than its northern counterpart, but is equally diverse.  Surfside Beach is directly below Myrtle Beach; consequently, some of the congestion is spilling over to this community. It is being forced to build new municipal buildings as its population swells. Like its neighbor to the south, Garden City, it is fighting to maintain its pristine beaches by not allowing high rise condominiums and hotels. Garden City is still more residential than commercial. It is a popular spot for surf fishing and family outings to the beach.  The residents of the small fishing village of Murrells Inlet preserve its heritage by continuing to fish in its many creeks and waterways. If you want fresh seafood, be sure to visit this self-proclaimed Seafood Capital of South Carolina. It is also the home of the lovely, serene Brookgreen Gardens. With over 6000 acres (2428.1 hectares) of sculpture and botanical gardens, it is a must see.  To get to Georgetown, continue traveling down Route 17 through Litchfield Beach and Pawley\''s Island. It has a relatively small population and is a well-kept secret, so it\''s a pleasure to leisurely walk the historic streets past the antebellum buildings.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Contemporary theater, particularly comedy, is also very much alive here.  Teatro Bellini opened as an opera house in 1864 and is now considered the most beautiful theater in Naples. Located near Piazza Dante, it offers a program of operatic and theatrical productions. Not far from the Bellini, on two streets which cut across Via Toledo, are two small theaters offering plays for young, cultured audiences: Galleria Toledo and the Teatro Nuovo. Though it is quite small, Sala Assoli, one of Teatro Nuovo\''s two performance spaces, has hosted spectacularly successful performances by some of Europe\''s finest actors and directors.Perhaps the best-loved of the Neapolitan theaters is the Sannazzaro, located on Via Chiaia not far from the Villa Comunale. It hosts popular theater, much of it linked to the tradition in Neapolitan dialect, and was a favorite of the most venerated local actors, including De Filippo, Nino Taranto, and Luisa Conte. Il Vomero, the posh, hilly district of the city, is home to another important theater, the Diana. Nearby, Teatro Cilea has a good theatrical school and offers works by local, contemporary writers. Other theaters to remember are the Palapartenope in Via Barbagallo, near the Palazzetto dello Sport, which hosts jazz and rock concerts. The Teatro dei Piccoli in Via Marco Polo offers a program of children\''s theater and music.The great Teatro San Carlo is another matter entirely. Adjacent to Piazza del Plebiscito, it is one of the city\''s most iconic monuments, and the oldest continuously active opera house in the world. It opened in 1737 and is considered second in importance only to the Scala in Milan, although it is larger and has impeccable acoustics. This temple of music has hosted world opera premieres for nearly three hundred years.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Naples has an intuitive, creative spirit, and it\''s also home to a treasure trove of first-rate museums. Visitors can tour palaces brimful with Baroque art, walk through preserved Roman ruins, marvel at the finest collection of Greco-Roman artifacts in the world, and see world-class contemporary art.The city\''s top museums are without a doubt the Museo di Capodimonte (Capodimonte Museum) and the Museo Archeologico Nazionale (National Archeological Museum).The Capodimonte Museum is southern Italy\''s largest art gallery, and has a vast permanent collection spread over 160 rooms and three floors, with works by Titian, Raphael, and Botticelli. The palatial building was originally designed as a hunting lodge for Charles VII of Bourbon. A small but worthwhile modern gallery houses Warhol\''s pop-tribute to Naples, <em>Mt. Vesuvius</em>. The museum\''s true highlight is Caravaggio\''s <em>The Flagellation of Christ</em>. It\''s secluded at the end of a corridor on the second floor, reverentially lit. The museum grounds are home to a regal public park, where families gather to picnic, kick a soccer ball, or catch the best views of the city. <em>Capodimonte</em> does mean, after all, \"the top of the hill.\" An hourly shuttle service runs between Piazza Trieste e Trento, the Catacombs of San Gennaro, and the museum.    Located down Corso Savoia from Capidomonte, the Museo Archeologico Nazionale is home to much of the Farnese collection, antiquities that Charles VII inherited from his mother, Elisabetta Farnese. Colossal sculptures from nearby sites in Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae stand on the ground floor. Highlights include <em>Ercole (Hercules)</em>, <em>Atlante Farnese (Atlantis),</em> and <em>Toro Farnese (Farnese Bull)</em>, a Roman copy of a Hellenistic sculpture depicting the death of the Queen of Thebes. Delicate mosaics mostly from Pompeii are on the mezzanine level. These include the striking, incomplete <em>La battaglia di Alessandro contro Dario (The Battle of Alexander against Darius)</em>, a wall-sized work considered the best-known depiction of Alexander the Great. A \"secret\" chamber beyond this section of the museum houses a small collection of ancient erotic art. The Catacombs of San Gennaro, an underground early Christian cemetery, became a pilgrimage site when San Gennaro, the city\''s patron saint, was buried there in the 5th Century. They are home to ancient mosaics, and sometimes host theater and music productions. The Capella Sansavero (Sansevero Chapel) is located smack dab in the center of Naples\'' historic center, and houses some very fine 18-century Italian art, including the remarkable <em>Cristo velato (Veiled Christ)</em>. Perched on the top of the Vomero neighborhood, The Museo San di Martino is 14th-century monastery with a large collection of Baroque art by Neapolitan masters. Visitors overwhelmed by the boundless collections of pre-modern art have some options. The Museo d\''arte Contemporanea Donnaregina, or, MADRE, houses contemporary art seen in most cosmopolitan cities, including works by Jeff Coons, Andy Warhol, Mimmo Paladino, and Damien Hirst. A horse sculpture called <em>Cavallo (Horse)</em> on the roof terrace is a treat. The Città della Scienza is an interactive science museum designed for children. It\''s located in Bagnoli, an ex-industrial district of Naples, in a 19th-century refurbished workshop near the sea.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Naples by night</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Naples has a vibrant nighthawk culture, and bars, pubs, sandwich bars, and spaghetti houses are full of young people from night until early in the morning.After the Second World War inhabitants took a liking to jazz, and more than a few great clubs remain, including Bourbon Street, Miles Jazz Club, and Libreria Berisio.Among the most popular dance clubs are the Blues e Blues and The New Twentythree. The mythical La Mela near Via dei Mille is a longtime favorite and true nighttime hotspot. L\''antiquario is a classy jazz club and bar with great cocktails. Cammarota Spritz draws locals and travelers to the Spanish Quarter with inexpensive, generous drinks, friendly staff, and good food nearby.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

As a visitor, it\''s best to decide which of its attributes you\''d like to focus on: the mysterious aspect which has its roots in legends, or the city\''s intriguing and turbulent history? The idyllic bay waters and villas, or the dense humanity of the most populated urban zones in Europe? Savor the peerless food or the peerless art?  The legendary saying is, \"See Naples and die.\"  It\''s not meant literally, but once you\''ve come to know Naples, the thinking goes, you\''ve seen it all, and can pass away peacefully because nothing else will compare.  The city is divided into 21 zones, and has so many monuments that it\''s rightfully known as an open-air museum. Meanwhile, here is a little guide to allow you to choose the most significant places of interest and tourist attractions, should you find yourself in this glorious city, with a limited amount of time.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Quartiere 1: Chiaia - Posillipo - San Ferdinando</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The monuments of this triangle are probably the ones that have made Naples famous, and offer one of the best itineraries for visitors. Piazza Municipio, one of the city\''s most impressive public squares, is itself dominated by the Castel Nuovo, or Maschio Angioino; within walking distance are the Teatro San Carlo, the splendid Galleria Umberto I°, the Piazza del Plebiscito with its semicircular colonnade, the majestic Palazzo Reale, and the domes of the splendid Chiesa di San Francesco di Paola. Down towards the sea are Santa Lucia and Borgo Marinaro, where the Castel dell\''ovo stands in all its glory.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Quartiere 2: Avvocata - Mercato - Montecalvario - Pendino - Porto - San Giuseppe</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Naples is characterized by its uniformity in town planning. In fact, the quarters that makes up the ancient center still faithfully adhere to the Greco-Roman plans for the ancient city of Neapolis, from which Naples takes its name. In these quarters are layer upon layer of history, unfolding before the eyes like the pages of an enormous history book. The alleyways overflowing with life in quarters such as San Giuseppe, Porto, and Pendino are the same ones in which Greeks would trade and build temples during the 4th Century. This is also the area which faces the bay; you must visit and take a long walk along the promenade from Via Partenope past Via Caracciolo until Mergellina, or stop by at Villa Comunale, which is blessed with trees dating back centuries, neoclassical statues, and striking fountains; it is here that you will find the oldest aquarium in Europe. The most important monument in the zone is the Villa Pignatelli, which today is home to a museum. The Museo Civico Filangieri is also located on Via Duomo and is housed inside the Palazzo Como, which was built during the Renaissance. Piazzetta Nilo is situated on Via San Biagio dei Librai, in which sits a 2,000-year-old statue, Statua del Corpo di Napoli. Following Spaccanapoli you can find other examples of Neapolitan culture: in Piazza San Domenico Maggiore lies the Basilica di San Domenico Maggiore and numerous palazzi from the Aragon and Spanish era, such as the Guglia which was dedicated to the Saint at the center. The Cappella di Sansevero is also worth a visit. Piazza del Gesù Nuovo yields such treasures as the Chiesa di Santa Chiara, the Chiostro di Santa Chiara, the 16th-century façade of the Chiesa di Gesù Nuovo, and the Guglia dell\''immacolata. The San Giovanni Maggiore was built on the remains of the 4th-century temple of Hercules and faces the piazza of San Giovanni, where the chapel of San Giovanni di Pappacoda houses a stupendous Gothic doorway. All of these places are representative, but not unique to the zones that developed and grew into the <em>centro antico</em>. The Spanish quarters consist of the elegant Via Toledo with its historic palazzi and churches that contain masterpieces of 17th-century Neapolitan painters; Piazza Monteoliveto, which contains Palazzo Gravina; the Fontana built in honor of Carlos II of Spain; and the church Sant\''anna dei Lombardi with its wealth of Renaissance treasures; Piazza Dante with the 18th-century façade of the National Boarding School il Convitto Nazionale; and Port\''alba, where the lazzari di Masaniello got the better of the cannons of the Viceroy.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Quartiere 3: San Carlo all\''arena - Stella</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Piazza della Sanità is home to the 17th-century Chiesa di Santa Maria, under which are the San Gaudosio Catacombs; the zona dei Vergini e zona delle Fontanelle are ancient areas used for burial in Greco-Roman Naples. Here you will also find the Palazzo Reale di Capodimonte, a palace built in 1738 and surrounded by a large park and wood, which acted as a hunting ground. On the grounds, with views of the cityscape, is the Museo di Capodimonte. The museum is a must visit, and houses Caravaggio\''s 17th-century masterpiece, <em>The Flagellation of Christ</em>.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Quartiere 4: Poggioreale - San Lorenzo - Vicaria</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It is practically impossible to list all the monuments in the three <em>decumani</em> and the numerous side streets (<em>i cardi</em>) which run perpendicular to them, but mention must be made of the following churches: San Paolo Maggiore which is built upon the foundations of the Tempio dei Dioscuri (two columns of the temple are still visible) and San Lorenzo Maggiore, underneath which are important archaeological remains which the public are able to visit. These two churches are located in Piazza San Gaetano, the ancient Roman marketplace along Via dei Tribunali. The church and street of San Gregorio Armeno are also worth a visit; the church was built on the site of a temple. Via dei Tribunali ends in front of Castel Capuano, the oldest fort in the city built for Norman kings. Behind it lies the Porta Capuana. Walking along Via Duomo, you will come across the Cathedral dedicated to San Gennaro, the city\''s patron saint. The cathedral seems to be in a place that does not seem grand enough for such an important building. You will also find the Duomo, which incorporates the ancient basilica of Santa Restituta built on the orders of Constantine, and the Battistero di San Giovanni in Fonte, which is the oldest baptistery in the western world. Beneath the Duomo lie ancient archaeological sites, which you can visit. The stratification begins with the ancient Greek and finishes with the Middle Ages. The Museo Archeologico Nazionale is one of the most important museums of its kind and is located in Piazza Museo. The Porta San Gennaro is located in Piazza Cavour and is one of the oldest gateways in the city. Via Santa Maria di Costantinopoli has many palazzi such as L\''accademia di Belle Arti and many dazzling churches. In Piazza Bellini one can still see traces of ancient Greek city walls. Other places of interest in the immediate vicinity are: Via Foria; Piazza Carlo III, which has an enormous façade; the Albergo dei Poveri; the Orto Botanico; Corso Garibaldi and the piazza of the same name, which is now the headquarters of Stazione Centrale.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Quartiere 5: Arenella - Vomero</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">These are hill zones which were developed at the end of the 19th Century as a residential district for the Neapolitan bourgeoisie. Il Vomero underwent radical changes in the 1950s and 1970s, which made it into one of the busiest areas in the city. It is linked to surrounding areas by three funicular railways, and retains some of the city\''s most important monuments. The Castel Sant\''elmo and the Certosa di San Martino were built around 1350 and dominate the city from above. Today, La Certosa houses the Museo di San Martino, which shows collections, paintings, sculptures, documents, and relics of Neapolitan tradition. Villa Floridiana was given by King Ferdinando of Bourbon to his second wife. At the center of this park stands a small palace which is now a museum (Il Museo della Ceramica Duca di Martina). Visitor\''s should not let a visit to the catacombs of San Gennaro pass them by. The catacombs were dug from the yellow tuff of the Aminei hills in the Capodimonte at the beginning of the 2nd Century. The galleries, which create a kind of underground basilica, leave a lasting impression. The sepulcher of San Gennaro and the tombs of the bishops, where lies the bishop of Carthage, are also nearby.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Quartiere 10: Bagnoli - Fuorigrotta</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A modern residential zone where the Rai and the Politecnico have their headquarters, the Fuorigrotta is also the new home of the Università Federico II and sports complexes such as the Stadio San Paolo. The trade show venue Mostra d\''oltremare, and the Edenlandia theme park, are located here. Bagnoli, a former industrial zone, is now home to the Città della Scienza, an interactive science museum housed in one of the old shed steelworks on the banks facing the island of Nisida.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Province of Naples</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Outside of the city of Naples, there are fantastic day trips and sights to see via train or boat! The nearby cities of Salerno, Ercolano, Pompei and Sorrento attract visitors from all over the globe. Looking eastwards, behold the Bay of Pozzuoli along with the islands of Capri, Ischia, and Procida, and the historical Campi Flegrei.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Like many large cities in the Mid-South, Nashville has spread out, taking over land from plantations and farms and now covering a large area that limits the ability to walk from one district to another. Granted, there are a few public bus routes and many taxi companies, but Nashville is a lot like Los Angeles: people here like to drive. There are more parking lots downtown than office buildings, and yet parking remains at a premium. If you arrive by plane, your first step should be to rent a car. Don\''t depend on public transportation—it\''s just not a dependable or convenient option.  The one exception to this overriding need for a car is if you plan on spending most of your time downtown. It\''s a short walk from tourist-friendly Second Avenue to famed Printers\'' Alley and all parts in between.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

If you hear a country song on the radio, it\''s virtually certain it was performed, recorded and mixed right here. You can hear your favorite songs and see your favorite artists perform virtually anywhere in Nashville, but there are a few tried and tested venues that stand out.  The Ryman Auditorium was the first home of the Grand Ole Opry show. Today, the radio show has moved, but there is still something special about the Ryman. Originally a church, this building\''s most famous visitors were not pilgrims on a religious journey, but rather country singers like Roy Acuff, Hank Williams, Merle Haggard and Dolly Parton. Although the big name stars now perform in the new Grand Ole Opry House, you can still hear great live music at the Ryman nightly. Country, blues, pop and jazz musicians take the stage to honor the past and look to the future. The Grand Ole Opry House is the venue for the biggest names in country music. The Country Music Awards (CMAs), country music\''s version of the Grammies®, are presented from this stage each year.  The Bluebird Cafe has been the starting point for many of today\''s top names in country music. Aspiring stars from Nashville and beyond take to this stage, and with good reason, as record company executives frequent the establishment looking for the next big star. For the wannabe country sensation, playing at the Bluebird is almost as big a thrill as playing at the Grand Ole Opry. You will hear Nashville\''s best here.The CMA Music Festival is the biggest and most popular country music festival in the United States. This five-day festival draws over one million visitors to the city each June.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For decades, the people of Nashville cried out for professional sports teams. Finally, the powers that be have heard their cries, and franchises of both the National Football League (NFL) and the National Hockey League (NHL) have been brought to the Music City.  The Tennessee Titans and the Tennessee State Tigers play home games in the modern Nissan Stadium. The stadium is state of the art and is quickly becoming known as the NFLs loudest stadium, thanks to the legions of fans who have waited patiently for a professional football team.  Hockey fans will love the bone-crushing action of the Nashville Predators. The \''preds\'', as they are known, play at the Bridgestone Arena.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If music and sports are not for you, perhaps you will enjoy one of the city\''s many museums. From fine art to local history, there is a lot to see and learn in Nashville.  The Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art features several galleries in one location, a 1920s mansion built by the prominent Cheek family. The mansion sits on 65 acres of beautifully landscaped property and houses a museum of fine art, a contemporary art gallery, gardens and more.  The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum features over 3,000 exhibits, including the gold records (plaques commemorating million sellers) and stage costumes of the early country stars. You\''ll learn about the origins of country music, what made it so popular and how it maintains its fierce following today.  In 1835, President Andrew Jackson built the beautiful Hermitage for his beloved wife; the home is now a popular site for visitors to the Music City. Everything has been perfectly preserved and restored to its original state. You will see what life was like in the early 19th century as you roam the halls of the immense home. Stroll through the tulip gardens, which were planted for the former first lady, and honor the memory of the late president as you pass the memorial to him and his wife. The Tennessee State Museum recounts the history of this iconic state, and chronicles events from pre-colonization to the Civil War, while the quirky Johnny Cash Museum gives you a peek into the life of this legendary music idol through diverse exhibits and photographs. The Frist Center for the Visual Arts, housed within a beautiful Art Deco building on Broadway, hosts a melange of visual art exhibitions.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theaters and Cinemas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nashville, a veteran soldier of the arts, is home to a splendid bunch of historic and intimate theater venues. From the Tennessee Performing Arts Center that hosts theatrical productions across its multiple stages, to the Nashville Repertory Theater with its lovely regional plays, and the Nashville\''s Children Theater, the city has several options to choose from. For contemporary and experimental plays, stop by at the Oz Arts Nashville.  The Belcourt Theater, a splendid historic venue dating back to 1925, is tucked away in the Hillsboro Village District, and plays everything from first-run movies and classics, to indie flicks and documentary films.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Recreation</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The natural beauty of the Tennessee hillsides is the area\''s greatest resource, and you can enjoy it via one of the many state parks in or around Nashville. If you enjoy hiking, biking, swimming or boating, you owe it to yourself and your family to stop by one of these magnificent facilities.  Built to commemorate Tennessee\''s 200th birthday in 1996, the Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park features a replica of the Parthenon and a statue of the Goddess Athena. If you can pull yourself away from the beauty of these two structures, you will find a number of walking trails and picnic areas.  For true nature-lovers, Lawrenceburg\''s Davy Crockett State Park is worth the two-hour drive. There, you can lie in the sun while the sounds and sights of nature lull you to sleep.  At the Warner Parks Nature Center, you will have a chance to experience the ecological diversity of Tennessee first hand. Take a hike on the more than 10 miles of trails, listen to lectures on environmental concerns and conservation, or take part in a guided tour of the wildlife preserve. Protecting the environment is the focus here, but this is also a top-notch outdoors facility meant to be enjoyed by you and your family.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1431,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Begin your visit Downtown and visit Puckett\''s Nashville for lunch. Next, stroll along Second Avenue and take in the sights. Downtown is famous for its music venues, and every storefront is part retail outlet and part performance hall. There are more specialty shops and cafes than you can visit in a week, and each features some kind of live music. Nowhere else can you shop for shoes while listening to a local band play a version of Hank Williams\'' \"Your Cheatin\'' Heart.\"  In the early days of the city, all of the printers were located on Printer\''s Alley. This section of downtown takes up three city blocks between Fourth and Fifth Avenues. Today there aren\''t many printers turning out playbills and newspapers, but there are museums and shops for visitors to explore. Some of the most prominent attractions here include the Ryman Auditorium, the Grand Ole Opry and the Schermerhorn Symphony Center. The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum and the Music City Center are also located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The West End/Music Row</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The West End of Nashville is home to Music Row. If you have any interest in country music or the music industry, this is a place where you should spend at least a day. Every major recording label in the United States has an office here. Record companies here typically work out of renovated homes and warehouses. The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting, which is the reason a lot of artists are choosing Nashville as the place to record their next projects. Some of the best recording studios in the nation share real estate with the record companies on this famous street. Stand outside Quad Studios and see what famous musical artist walks out the door.  Two blocks from Music Row on West End Avenue lies Elliston Place. This is one of Nashville\''s trendy neighborhoods. Small homes and cafes typify the tenants of the area. And then there\''s the Elliston Place Rock Block, a block-long section of Elliston Avenue that is home to six of the loudest nightclubs in town. This is not the place to go if you are interested in quiet conversation—this is where you go to listen to great country music and party into the wee hours of the night.  The West End is also home to Vanderbilt University, one of the nation\''s finest private universities and the alma mater of former Vice President Al Gore. The lush and expansive campus provides much-needed green space in Nashville\''s West End area, as well as opportunities for visitors to enjoy collegiate sporting events, art museums and symphonic concerts. The Parthenon, a museum in Centennial Park, and the historic RCA Studio B, are also located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Gulch</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">An upmarket neighborhood and also one of Nashville\''s most historic districts, The Gulch is a cool Nashville spot that hosts some of the hippest hotels in the city, along with a host of historic buildings and luxury boutiques. The 404 Hotel and the Thompson Nashville are some of the most well-known hotels in the area. This neighborhood, located on Nashville\''s south-west fringe, is also known for iconic music venues such as the Station Inn and the Mercy Lounge. The Union Station Hotel, an erstwhile railroad terminal, and the Frist Center for the Visual Arts is also located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">East Nashville</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This whimsical neighborhood, like the rest of its counterparts, is also brimming with a vibrant energy that attracts scores of music enthusiasts and hip hordes to its leafy locality. Located to the east of the Cumberland River, this lovely neighborhood hosts a fantastic culinary scene that is unrivaled in the city, with some of the best restaurants and cafes like this unique restaurant, scattered across its bonny streets. There is also much art to be seen, seeing as that East Nashville is home to Five Points area, a renowned hub for street art. Not to be missed are other superb attractions like the Shelby Park, the Nissan Stadium, and the legendary stretch of the Fatherland Street, home to a plethora of bars and cafes.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hermitage</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This far eastern neighborhood that lies a little outside of the city proper, was named after The Hermitage, the residence of former President Andrew Jackson that lies within its boundaries. Although this district is part of the larger metropolitan area, it is considered a suburb of Nashville city. It is a partly industrial neighborhood, lined with an array of retail stores and corporate offices, although a few suburban houses dot the streets as well.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outside the City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Brentwood</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">South of the Music City lies the suburb of Brentwood. This is where the affluent live and where corporations have been relocating over the last decade, meanwhile escaping the congestion of downtown traffic. Brentwood offers the best shopping in town with large shopping malls and a number of factory outlet centers. However, Brentwood also suffers from poor public transportation. You will be lucky to even find a bus, much less catch a ride on one. This is definitely a place where you should drive your car.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Franklin</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A little further South is the historic town of Franklin. One of the oldest towns in Middle Tennessee, Franklin is famous for its numerous antique malls and neighborhood cafes. A drive down Main Street is like driving through a Norman Rockwell painting. This is typical small-town U.S.A., filled with history and charm and friendly folks who are always willing to offer directions or tell a tall tale or two. After 200 years, Franklin has retained its quiet Southern charm.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Opryland</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you arrive in Nashville via the International Airport, you will be in the Opryland area. For many, this is the final destination, and with good reason. For decades, the district around the Opryland theme park kept the city of Nashville alive. The Music City owes a great deal to the now defunct amusement park that was once home to the Grand Ole Opry, the world-renowned country music venue. The Opry drew millions of visitors every year, and the area surrounding it grew up rapidly. Today, the theme park has been turned into the largest shopping center in the South, Opry Mills. The Opry still stands and still offers the greatest in Country Music entertainment.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

To some, it is the fine sand that ribbons the coast, while others envision the world-class casinos that the Bahamas are known for. Still others dream of escaping to a colonial island paradise whose government increasingly recognizes that its inherent beauty is its economic strength. And for a few, thoughts turn back to the 1980s, the days of anarchy exemplified by the TV show <em>Miami Vice</em>, as well as romance on the high seas. All this makes for a city that offers a plethora of water sports and activities, superb shopping, excellent historic sites and a hopping nightlife scene. But of course, the city of Nassau is so much more, it is an antidote for people needing relief from the day-to-day hassles and stress of life in the \"real world\" despite its repute as the capital city of the Bahamas.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The city\''s museums and historic sites may be few but are brimming with intrigue and wholesome appeal. The Pirates of Nassau is an interactive museum that brings to life the Golden Age of Piracy, a vibrant era in the history of the island that makes for an entertaining sojourn for the whole family. At the 19th-century Villa Doyle, the National Art Gallery of the Bahamas features an ever-changing array of paintings, sculpture, textiles, ceramics and photography produced by Bahamian artists and expats like Amos Ferguson and Stanley Burnside. There\''s also the Heritage Museum of the Bahamas and the Junkanoo World Museum that delves into the history of this age-old festival and parade of Akan origin celebrated on Boxing day and New Year\''s Day each year.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The performing arts are celebrated in Nassau and Paradise Island in its many forms at venues like the Dundas Centre for the Performing Arts and the National Centre for the Performing Arts. Both venues feature a diverse program of events with everything from operas and ballet recitals to concerts, plays and musicals. As for concerts, the Atlantis Live Stage at Paradise Island and Arawak Cay often host sold-out performances by international artists, while across the city, bars and nightclubs jive to the tunes laid-out by residents bands. For a hearty laugh, head to the Jokers Live Club at the Atlantis Resort for stand-up comedy shows.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife in Nassau runs the gamut from laid-back local pubs to dazzling nightclubs; a star-studded affair that will leave you spoiled for choice. There\''s the Hammerhead Bar & Grill between the two bridges to Paradise Island where locals gather for a drink or two with live music and foosball on the cards. For a night of dancing, few can beat the stellar line-up and chic décor of the Aura Nightclub and Bambu. Club Waterloo is an old favorite, while 22 Above serves creative cocktails in a chic setting. For stand-up comedy, the Jokers Live Club at the Atlantis Resort is your best bet. You will find most of the city\''s nightlife venues clustered around the waterfront down Bay Street, and at Paradise Island\''s scintillating resorts.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Amusement Parks, Zoos and Aquariums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nassau and Paradise Island\''s family-friendly attractions are clustered mainly at the Atlantis Resort, from the thrilling rides of the Aquaventure Water Park to the mesmerizing antics of the dolphins at Dolphin Cay. Marvel at the aquatic exhibits of The Dig and visit the animals at Ardastra; Nassau and Paradise Island\''s parks, gardens and zoos are full of intriguing creatures to encounter.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">No mention of Nassau and Paradise Island is complete without mention of their beaches. The city is blessed with sandy shores kissed by the waters of the Atlantic and bathed in sunshine all year round. The white sand is powder-fine and deliciously soft, perfect for a day in the sun. Cable Beach is undoubtedly one of Nassau\''s most popular, while Cabbage and Paradise Beach top Paradise Island\''s fabled strips of sand. The city\''s beaches come with all the expected trimmings, including fabulous beachfront bars and cafes, quaint shops and ample opportunity for water sports.The more adventurous can venture to the depths of the ocean, embark on a snorkeling excursion or scuba dive, indulge in a boat tour, or simply explore the Blue Lagoon. For a rewarding day on the green, the Paradise Island Golf Club is a top choice.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping in Nassau and Paradise Island spans the spectrum from luxury, designer boutiques to local markets and craft shops selling authentic Bahamian souvenirs. Down Bay Street lie a string of fantastic shops and local boutiques, while the Crystal Court Shops at the Atlantis Resort epitomize luxurious indulgence. For genuine Bahamian handicrafts, there are plenty of fine options to explore, the most popular being the Craft Cottage, Bahamas Craft Centre, the Nassau Straw Market and Festival Place. Marina Village is another charming locale brimming with superb shops — a haven for shopping enthusiasts.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Casinos</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With over 75 gaming tables and 700 slot machines, the Atlantis Casino is one of the Caribbean\''s largest. Abode of lady luck, the casino is a dazzling venture that spans 60,000 square feet (5574.18 square meters) with an innovative design that exudes good taste. Open 24 hours a day for non-stop gaming action, the casino also boasts chic bars and a fabulous nightlife. While the Atlantis is most certainly the star of the show, Nassau and Paradise Island are home to several other casinos as well, although none quite as grand as this.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The annual Junkanoo Parade is the highlight of Nassau\''s cultural program, a vibrant celebration of life in the Bahamas. Revelers don flamboyant costumes and take to the streets, dancing to the energetic beat of Junkanoo, a musical style that is uniquely Bahamian. The festival is celebrated in Nassau on Boxing Day and New Year\''s Day each year, drawing visitors from near and far to join in on the festivities.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1441,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown is a hub of activity that grooves along to the pulse of Nassau. Thousands of people visit daily, to shop, dine, sightsee and enjoy the bustling atmosphere of this port city. While the busiest part of Downtown is the Bay Street thoroughfare and Woodes-Rodgers Walk, located across the street from the port and parallel to Bay, the area actually extends for several blocks in either direction. West Bay forms the core of this neighborhood, centered on the Junkanoo Beach area. A few hotels and restaurants are located here, most notably Compass Point and Holiday Inn. Nearby, the British Colonial Hotel marks the beginning of Bay Street proper. The Pirates of Nassau Museum lies just across the street, flanked by a medley of duty-free shops. The next few blocks of Bay Street are wall-to-wall boutiques, with a few restaurants and clubs interspersed in between. Famous historical landmarks are all around, including the lovely Vendue House, better known as Pompey Museum, and Christ Church Cathedral. The concentration of tourist-friendly establishments peter out after about seven blocks, but smaller, more local stores can be found all the way down Bay Street to the foot of the Paradise Island Bridge. This marks the beginning of East Bay. The Red Carpet Inn, one of Nassau\''s best budget hotels, is located here alongside a modest collection of restaurants.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cable Beach</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If Downtown Bay Street is known for its shopping, Cable Beach is the recognized hotel district. Five enormous hotels—two of them all-inclusive—are located along this strip. The area is also known for its dining options, the magnificent Crystal Palace Casino, and of course the golden sands of Cable Beach itself. Most of the area\''s restaurants are located either in the hotels or across the street. The Black Angus Steakhouse, Nikkei and Capriccio are three of the best dining options on Cable Beach, offering unique décor, a serene atmosphere, and distinctive cuisine. There is little to no nightlife, however. People frequent Cable Beach during the day, relaxing by hotel pools or on the beach. This is a quieter, calmer locale in comparison to the bustling enclaves of Downtown. It\''s harder to walk from one place to another but few are inclined to do so in any case; it\''s quite customary to simply relax at a pool bar or splash in the waves instead of flitting from place to place. If things get dull, Bay Street and its exuberant charms are just a cab or bus ride away.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Paradise Island</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Linked to Nassau by a pair of bridges, Paradise Island is a picturesque isle off the coast of New Providence that lives up to its name. Pristine, white-sand beaches edge the turquoise waters of the Atlantic, while top-notch attractions like the Atlantis Casino, Aquaventure Water Park and Dolphin Cay are close at hand. There are boutiques and celebrity chef restaurants galore - Paradise Island is the upscale Caribbean escape, its teeming waters a cynosure for snorkeling and scuba dives.Nothing can prepare one for the sight of the Atlantis, an enormous resort modeled after the eponymous mythical sunken city. The rest of Paradise Island isn\''t at all shabby either. In fact, it is a veritable man-made oasis, built over what used to be a lackluster patch of ground known as Hog Island. The first to draw visitors to the island was the venerable Club Land\''or. While this tiny club has been very much overshadowed by the sprawling Atlantis, it still boasts many loyal fans. Golfers should check out the Clarion South Ocean Resort and Golf Club, while wealthy travelers desiring solitude will appreciate the Sheraton.There\''s ample variety for shopping as well. The Crystal Court at the Atlantis features a dozen of some of the world\''s best and most expensive designer boutiques. On the other end of the spectrum, Paradise Plaza has a number of shops that sell inexpensive beach gear and souvenirs. Fine dining is everywhere, most notably at the Blue Lagoon and at Fathoms, while for a family dinner, Anthony\''s is a good choice. Choosing a daytime activity is easy: the beach is everywhere, and it\''s gorgeous. Many aquatic excursions depart from the Paradise Island Port instead of (or in addition to) Nassau Harbor. Paradise Island is stunning in some parts and lovely in others, while portions are simply unfinished. There is constant construction and frequent renovations as hotels strive to match the world-famous Atlantis. This is easily the most expensive and tourist-oriented place in all of the Bahamas, but no one would deny that it\''s a lot of fun. There\''s no bus over the Bridge. Drive, or take a cab or bus to the foot and walk over.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Other Neighborhoods</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are many other parts of Nassau, however, they are strictly for locals; so there\''s nothing in the way of attractions, and very little to see. Anyone looking for a stereo, a pair of jeans or some inexpensive groceries can hop on a number 18 bus from the transit center and head to the Marathon Mall.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (1450,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It is tough to know where to start when talking about the culturally rich entertainment scene in New Haven. The New Haven Symphony, the fourth-oldest orchestra in the nation, draws from the rich talent pool of Yale\''s renowned music department. Similarly, the Yale Repertory Theatre has close ties to Yale\''s drama department, and there is much cross-fertilization with New Haven\''s other famous professional theater, the Long Wharf. Broadway-bound plays premiere at The Shubert where the majority of Rogers & Hammerstein musicals premiered as well as stage plays by Tennessee Williams. The Yale Cabaret, on the other hand, is a well-kept secret, showcasing the work of Yale students to the accompaniment of some of the best food in town. Sprague and Woolsey Halls host some 300 concerts a year sponsored by the Yale Graduate School of Music. On a more formal note, if you prefer ties and tails as opposed to lawn chairs and mosquitoes, the Chamber Music Society at Yale presents concerts of fine chamber music throughout the year, and the New Haven Gaelic Players presents well-known works of Irish playwrights.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Live Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Elm City has a long history of jazz, and the New Haven Jazz Festival has been bringing top-notch acts to the region for over 20 years. The festival has gained international fame as one of the largest, longest-running, free music festivals in the country. For years, clubs like The Foundry and Cafe Nine have provided jazz artists with a cool place to jam. Speaking of jamming, the first place that comes to mind when one thinks of modern and rock music in New Haven is Toad\''s Place, a hopping place for over 25 years. Many of the country\''s most famous rock and roll artists—The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen, among them— have performed in the Toad\''s intimate space.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Yale has formidable collections, which it opens to the public. The Yale University Art Gallery, founded in 1832, is the oldest university art gallery in the country. The Yale Center for British Art contains the largest collection of British art outside the United Kingdom. The Peabody Museum of Natural History houses an important collection of dinosaur fossils and natural science collections; it was also portrayed on <em>The Simpsons</em> as where C. Montgomery Burns\'' son Larry was conceived amongst a penguin exhibit. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments has almost 1000 instruments on display, and the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library features one of the last surviving Gutenberg Bibles along with numerous other treasures. As you drive north from New Haven into adjoining Hamden, the Eli Whitney Museum honors the great inventor with displays dedicated to his \"passion for making things.\"</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In downtown New Haven, there are plenty of art cinemas that showcase the latest hits from the United States and Europe. The Criterion Cinemas on Temple offers cinephiles a chance to catch up on hits, or on Sunday mornings, watch classic films from the 1930s and 1940s. On the Shoreline, in the town of Madison, there is the two-screen Madison Art Cinemas where you can watch the latest foreign films as well as partake in special screenings of soon-to-be-released movies. The best bet for larger, mega-plex movie theaters lies outside the city, but within a relatively short drive; to the east lies the Regal Branford Stadium, a twelve-screen multiplex with comfy seats, a food court and late night security.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Family Fun</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you happen to have the kids with you the New Haven area is packed with fun things for children to do and see. Both the Yale Art Gallery and Center for British Art offer kid-friendly activities and programs on a revolving basis. The Peabody Museum of Natural History is great for dinosaur fans, and the Children\''s Museum is located downtown. Although it is only open on Fridays and Saturdays, it is an excellent pit-stop for a few hours of entertainment for tykes from ages 3-11. In Essex, about 30 minutes east off I-95, there is the Essex Steam Train & Riverboat for scenic rides along the Connecticut River - an unforgettable experience especially fall when the scenery is a riot of color in shades of gold, red and orange. Further down I-95 is the town of Mystic where Mystic Seaport and Aquarium are located, definite draws for children, history buffs and maritime enthusiasts. In Bridgeport, west of New Haven, there is the P.T. Barnum Museum, Discovery Museum and Beardsley Zoo.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1451,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown and Yale</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The first thing most people associate with New Haven is Yale, one of the world\''s great universities. The city of New Haven grew around the heart of the campus, which is a commanding display of classic colonial and modern Gothic architecture. Several world-renowned museums and theaters are located on or near the campus, such as the Yale Center for British Art, the Yale University Art Gallery, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library and the Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments. It is an aesthetic treat that attracts laymen and architecture buffs alike.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Green</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">New Haven was the first planned city in the country, and the New Haven Green was part of the original city plan. The Green\''s 16 acres (6.4 hectares) form the heart of downtown New Haven, as well as bordering the eastern edge of the Yale campus. The Green hosts a variety of local cultural, entertainment and social events during the course of the year. Impressive municipal buildings face the Green, as well as three churches: Trinity Church, First Congregational Church of Christ (also known locally as the Center Church), and the United Church, all built around 1813, and wonderful examples of Gothic, Federal and Georgian architecture. The area northeast of the Green is home to the Audubon Arts District. Here you will find a brick-lined street lined with condominiums, restaurants, stores and the headquarters for the Greater New Haven Arts Council. To the southeast of the Green is the section of downtown now known as Ninth Square, one of the nine squares that made up New Haven\''s original layout. The area includes sections of Chapel Street, Church Street, George Street and State Street. Although this redeveloping area does not yet have much shopping and dining, some restaurants of note include the Zinc with its farm-to-table, Asian eats and the award-winning gay hangout, Gotham Citi, on Church Street.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Long Wharf</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Long Wharf area, on New Haven harbor, is disconnected from the rest of downtown, but is nonetheless an integral part of New Haven. There is an industrial area, and a commercial harbor. The Long Wharf Theatre, one of the country\''s best-known and most-honored regional theaters, is located here, as is the enormous Sports Haven, offering telecast horse and dog racing. At Brazi\''s, near the theater, patrons can enjoy an Italian feast before or after a show.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">East Shore</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The East Shore is best known for the Lighthouse Point Park, on the Sound. There is a landmark lighthouse, built in 1840, a beautifully restored carousel, and lovely views. The East Shore neighborhood has a colorful history. On July 5, 1779 the British landed on East Shore, overcame a small, colonial garrison at Black Rock Fort, and marched into New Haven for their one-day occupation of the city. East Shore is home to the Pardee-Morris House, built in 1680, one of the few survivors of the British Invasion and three centuries of waterfront storms.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fair Haven</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fair Haven is another neighborhood on the Sound, and its earliest history is connected to oystering. The first European settlers took over oystering from the native Quinnipiac Indians. Today, because of pollution, oysters harvested here are moved to cleaner waters for several weeks before being served in local restaurants—where they are considered quite safe to eat. Other Fair Haven highlights include the Fair Haven Woodworks, offering a remarkable collection of handcrafted furniture, and the small Riverside Park along the Quinnipiac River, where some gentrification has begun to occur.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">City Point/Oyster Point</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Howard Avenue, along the water\''s edge in Oyster Point, also known as City Point, reminds you of a small fishing village. Many grandiose homes built in the 1880s have been restored to their original beauty. Although there was a period of decay after the neighborhood was cut off from the rest of the city by Interstate 95, this quiet sea-side area has come to be known as one of the more pleasing areas to visit in New Haven. At one of the docks at the end of Howard Avenue is the Shell & Bones, where you can dine on fresh oysters while taking in the sights and sounds of the harbor.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wooster Square (Little Italy)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Wooster Square was named after the New Haven Revolutionary War hero, David Wooster. It was once a neighborhood of elegant brownstones clustered around a square, but many of the houses were razed for factories and tenements for Irish workers in the mid 19th Century. In the late 1800s, Italian immigrants replaced the Irish, creating the \"Little Italy\" we know today, commonly referred to simply as Wooster Street. Wooster Street and Wooster Square engender thoughts of New Haven\''s famous <em>pizzerias</em>, Pepe\''s and Sally\''s, which vie for the title of best pizza in the world. The first pizza in the country was served here, and it is still home to some of the best Italian cuisine around, with restaurants and bakeries such as Consiglio\''s, Lucibello\''s, and Tre Scalini. Wooster Street itself is unassuming but, in the summer, the street is alive with festivals and celebrations. It is one of New Haven\''s more lively and colorful neighborhoods.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shoreline East</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For a scenic drive and quick escape from the city, take Interstate 95 or even Boston Post Road north towards Providence. The small towns that dot the shoreline are full of delightful historic sights, beaches, eateries, shopping and hotels. The 17th-18th Century homes in these towns are products of reconstruction after numerous hurricanes and raids by Native Americans and the British that often left the entire towns in ruins. Branford, the largest of these towns, is home to Stony Point and port of departure for the nearby Thimble Islands. The next town over is Guilford, home to Bishop\''s Orchards and one of the prettiest town greens in Connecticut that hosts the renowned Guilford Art Center Craft Expo every July. Hammonasset State Park in Madison offers a fantastic stretch of sandy beaches for young and old to enjoy, pick up some books at R.J. Julia, and afterwards feast upon seafood at Lenny & Joe\''s Fish Tale. In both Clinton and Westbrook, indulge in some serious shopping at Clinton Crossing and the Tanger Outlet Center. Old Saybrook, where Yale University was chartered as College back in 1701, was also home to actress Katharine Hepburn until her death in 2003. It is the most developed and commercial of the shoreline towns with plenty of restaurants, stores and beaches for locals and tourists.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

There are still plenty of festivals to go around, including Southern Decadence with the ultimate drag parade down Royal Street; the French Quarter Festival in April that attracts local and international bands as well as some of Jazz Fest\''s favorite food vendors; and the Creole Tomato Festival, a smaller affair, but just as delicious.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music & Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A ton of musical history and a citywide penchant for \"shakin\'' it\" make New Orleans ground zero for catching great music all year long. While Bourbon Street is the undisputed heart of New Orleans\'' live music and nightlife realms, if you go local and hit clubs outside the French Quarter you\''ll find yourself rarely paying more than a USD5 cover charge with standard bar prices. Frenchman\''s Street and Decatur Street also boast a wealth of more authentically local establishments, while the Warehouse District is where you\''ll find the city\''s trendiest clubs.New Orleans is most famous for jazz. This is where this musical genre was born, and the natives haven\''t forgotten it. You can capture the various evolutionary forms of this African-European musical merger throughout the city. Fans of Dixieland should stick with the Quarter\''s top venues: Fritzel\''s and Preservation Hall - understandably touristy, but undeniably soul satisfying. Modern Jazz buffs will enjoy the omnipresence of Ellis Marsalis, father of Wynton and Branford, as he appears in various combos at Snug Harbor on Frenchmen Street. The next most popular New Orleans musical requests? Cajun and Zydeco -additional examples of the melding of European and African stylings. Both genres fall under the \"unapologetic dance\" heading and draw on their strong regional country roots with accordions, washboards and smatterings of French lyrics. Tipitina\''s Uptown hosts a Fais-Do-Do every Sunday night featuring the traditional selections of Bruce Daigrepont. The sessions serve as a weekly reunion of Cajun aficionados from around the city, but beginners are welcomed wholeheartedly as well. At Mid-City Lanes Rock and Bowl, the pine floor boards creak as Zydeco bands play to enthusiastic throngs every Thursday night. Finally, check out Mulate\''s on Julia Street, a great place to brush up on your waltz and get some good grub. Speaking of dancing, international enthusiasts can get their tango/reggae/salsa groove on at Mimi\''s in the Marigny on Wednesday nights and the Loft 523 on Tuesdays. As for funk, check out live performances by former Meters man George Porter Jr. and Walter \"Wolfman\" Washington at the Maple Leaf Bar on Oak Street Uptown or the French Quarter\''s House of Blues. It\''s back into the Quarter and the Blue Nile for bigger name out-of-town acts. Other nightlife attractions to be found in the area include karaoke at Cat\''s Meow on Bourbon Street, and bass bumping house and disco tunes at neighboring Bourbon Pub and Oz, two of the more integrated gay clubs in the city. Wind things down with a visit to Kerry Irish Pub on Decatur Street. This spot preserves the integrity of Irish pub culture: quiet conversation, respect for local musicians and relaxed service. Once you\''ve had your fill of New Orleans live music scene, nightclubs like the Warehouse District\''s Republic and Metropolitan, and The Beach on Bourbon are the best bets for fantastic DJ sets, swanky decor and a seemingly endless night of dancing.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums & Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums range from the nationally significant D-Day Museum and Confederate Museum to the more obscure Pharmacy Museum - a celebration of the 19th-century apothecary. Most political, sociological and architectural exhibitions of interest can be found in the French Quarter, home of the Louisiana State Museum and it\''s various branches, as well as the Historic New Orleans Collection and important historical residences. Art lovers will enjoy the huge collection of international art work and archaeological finds at the New Orleans Museum of Art (NOMA). A small showcase of African American art is viewable at the Villa Meilleur in the Faubourg Treme District and the McKenna Museum of African-American Art. There are several smaller contemporary art galleries as well, such as the Arthur Roger Gallery, the Contemporary Arts Center, Gallery Orange and Guthrie Contemporary.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Straddling the line between museum and art gallery, the Contemporary Art Center (CAC) is housed in a spectacularly renovated warehouse on Camp Street that offers two floors of touring artwork. The upper-level gallery usually features nationally acclaimed artists and the lower level gallery is a showcase for local artists working in the same medium is represented on the second floor. The CAC also stages a variety of art appreciation events, concerts, and cutting-edge theater productions. For more mainstream performing arts events the place to be is downtown. Theater lovers have a variety of options to choose from - contemporary performances by the Southern Rep; the Saenger Theatre on Rampart Street, host to national touring companies and A-list comedians; and the cozy Le Petit Theatre du Vieux Carre in the Quarter, where classics and Broadway musicals are performed by local acting vets. Ballet and opera lovers can view local and touring ensembles at the Mahalia Jackson Theatre Of Performing Arts in Louis Armstrong Park, while the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra plays various venues around the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">All manifestations of material goods are yours for purchasing. Try Magazine Street, lower Garden District to Uptown, for funky, used and questionably French items; Royal Street, for classic antiques; and the Central Business District\''s Canal Place and sprawling Riverwalk for fashion. Music buffs take note of the Louisiana Music Factory across from the House of Blues, as well as the GHB Jazz Foundation at the French Market, stocked with Dixieland, traditional and classic jazz recordings.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Casinos</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It was only a matter of time before the ultimate addition was made to the Quarter\''s increasingly adult playground atmosphere. Located at the corner of St. Peter and Canal Streets, one of the newest links in the Harrah\''s Casino chain, the resort houses 100,000 square feet of slots and table games, dining and entertainment.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Children\''s Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Audubon Zoo, at the rear of Audubon Park , and its sister site, the Aquarium of the Americas, at the Riverfront, are excellent family diversions. Both facilities are impressive showcases of creatures found regionally and across the world, including such rarities as white tigers and 450-pound sharks. The Aquarium of the Americas is also home to New Orleans\'' IMAX theater. Outdoor enthusiasts can choose between two gorgeous oak-filled parks: Audubon Uptown or New Orleans City Park in Mid-City, the nation\''s fifth largest urban park. Both public greens offer golf courses, play areas and horseback riding.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Natives of New Orleans are passionate about sports and support their teams with much enthusiasm at home games. The city boasts a long and illustrious sports history, a legacy that is carried forward to this day. The city plays host to a number of major sporting events each year, including NCAA college football and basketball playoffs, the Super Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, the Zurich Classic PGA Tour and horse racing at the Fair Grounds Race Course. The city\''s Superdome is also the home of the New Orleans Saints (NFL), while the Smoothie King Center hosts the New Orleans Pelicans (NBA).</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1460,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">French Quarter</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The French Quarter, or <em>Vieux Carre</em> in French, is the oldest neighborhood in New Orleans. It lies in a bend of the Mississippi River and consists of fairly narrow streets, reminiscent of European city planning, that reveal hidden courtyards overhung with wrought iron balconies. The architecture in the Quarter largely dates to the late 18th and early 19th Centuries, and draws on French and Spanish influences. In the daytime, the French Quarter, especially the area around Jackson Square, is filled with tourists, street performers, and the occasional conman. At night, the French Quarter transforms into the vibrant party scene. Barhopping college students, adventurous suburbanites, tourists, and others spill from the many bars that line Bourbon Streets with drinks in hand, their smiling faces lit by the neon glow of street signs.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lower Canal Street</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once the main shopping district of New Orleans, lined with popular department stores and theaters, Canal Street lost much of its grandeur to a sluggish economy in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, Harrah\''s New Orleans and an expanded convention center have helped this part of Canal Street to develop into a ten block strip of hotels, souvenir shops and electronics stores. The Outlet Collection at Riverwalk, which is near the Aquarium of the Americas and the Ernest M. Morial Convention Center, also makes this a popular stop for tourists.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Central Business District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The scattered, mismatched skyscrapers and superbly unusual Superdome of the Central Business District form the recognizable skyline of New Orleans. Several modern hotels, as well as older and established accommodations, are located in the heart of the CBD and the New Orleans\'' business community. Bustling during the day with local businesspeople, this area is quite subdued at night. Since the district empties each evening, many of the guests from the hotels in the neighborhood head for the Quarter.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Garden District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Garden District is New Orleans\'' premier residential neighborhood, intersected by the famed Saint Charles Avenue, lined with tremendous oak trees and home after home epitomizing the antebellum\''s Greek Revival style of architecture. Only a walking tour will do this dazzling district justice. If you visit the city, you must see the lush, overgrown gardens and grand mansions that dapple the streets of this neighborhood. The Garden District has many well-known residents, including Trent Reznor, Archie Manning, and Anne Rice.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mid-City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mid-City usually goes unnoticed by the average tourist until Jazz Fest, when thousands of eager visitors, bedecked in shorts and tank tops, crowd onto the Esplanade bus to reach the New Orleans Fairgrounds. Quiet and verdant with trees, Mid-City attracts locals with its wide offering of moderately priced restaurants. Here, you will also find the New Orleans City Park, and the New Orleans Museum of Art. For tourists, Mid-City is home to impressive above-ground cemeteries, including Metairie Cemetery, Oddfellow\''s Rest, and St. Louis Cemetery #3.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Uptown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Oak-lined streets, Victorian mansions, and college cafes are staples of New Orleans\'' thriving Uptown neighborhood. St. Charles Avenue and Pyrtania Street offer examples of Colonial Revival architecture. The neighborhood is also home to Tulane and Loyola Universities. In addition to the mansions and universities, many pleasant coffee shops, antique stores, and restaurants crowd the small spaces between the fantastic homes of New Orleans\'' upper class. Residents and visitors alike can be seen jogging the two miles through Uptown\''s gorgeous, Spanish moss-filled Audubon Park each morning.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Warehouse District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Having outgrown the once-appropriate title, this historic New Orleans\'' neighborhood is no longer frequented by blue-collar factory workers. Instead, it is now a vibrant arts district populated by the city\''s young professionals. Some of the best art galleries in the city sit alongside restaurants that offer excellent cuisine. In addition, locals and tourists crowd into the streets of the district during festivals such as Art for Art\''s Sake, when plenty of wine, cheese, gumbo, and art clutter the sidewalks and shops of the Warehouse District.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Year round, most museums offer a day of free admission during the week. Many other galleries and museums are free all the time. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is technically free, although they do push you for an optional donation. Other nearby museums include the Guggenheim Museum and the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA<u>)</u>. Other interesting museums in the city include the American Folk Art Museum, the ever popular American Museum of Natural History and the Lower East Side Tenement Museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Those without means will find summertime particularly rich with options. From concerts by the New York Philharmonic to Shakespeare in Central Park, free culture is everywhere. Catch all types of performances at Symphony Space. Downtown, with its traditionally youthful edge, offers numerous free choices. The Sidewalk Cafe is a great venue overflowing with every kind of band trying to make it in this big, bad city. Some are better than others. See well-known bands up close at the Bowery Ballroom. Frank Sinatra was wise when he sang, \"If I can make it there, I\''ll make it anywhere...\" The world\''s best performers know that without success in the Big Apple, they aren\''t really successful, and a good measure of achievement is the chance to perform at Madison Square Garden. From the latest diva at the Metropolitan Opera House to Irving Plaza\''s hottest band, the best of the best make it all look easy.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Attractions</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Even without a concert, from Belvedere Castle to Sheep\''s Meadow, Central Park itself provides numerous amusements for its visitors. Spending a day at the Bronx Zoo is a longstanding New York City pastime. For some local and national history, take a trip on the Circle Line and pay a visit to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and its immigration museum, both important landmarks for the melting pot that is America.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many days, visitors may choose between a pricey Broadway extravaganza or one of the city\''s numerous free parades. Adventurous theatergoers eschew Broadway for off- and off-off-Broadway while those seeking to express themselves haunt the city\''s many nightclubs. Meanwhile, divas and drag queens prove nightly that cabaret is not a thing of the past. De La Guarda and Blue Man Group are totally funky yet accessible ongoing off-Broadway shows.In addition to being a museum, the MoMA (Museum of Modern Art) is a performance and cinema mecca. See world-class comedians perform at Dangerfield\''s and Carolines on Broadway. The Metropolitan Opera and The New York City Ballet dazzle at Lincoln Center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Walking down Fifth Avenue or St. Marks Place (two streets as different as they can be) entertains New Yorkers far more than most Hollywood movies. If the outdoor entertainment is not enough, catch a movie at AMC Loews Lincoln Square 13 with IMAX. Art films from all over the world play at the Film Forum while the Anthology Film Archives show avant-garde cinema and hosts film screenings regularly.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For sports fans, there\''s plenty to take in in New York. With professional teams across a variety of sports, there\''s always a game on here. The U.S. Open sees the world\''s best tennis champions vying for the title. The New York Yankees play on home turf at the Yankees Stadium and the New York Giants have sports bars packed during their games. Watch the Rangers and the Knicks defeat their rivals at Madison Square Garden. Ice-skating at Wollman Rink is a great way to see Central Park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From swanky Manhattan cocktail lounges to live music on Bleeker and Harlem\''s iconic jazz bars to hipster hangouts and craft beer in Williamsburgh, there\''s no shortage of nightlife in the city. Around the NYU and Greenwich Village, there are great spots to enjoy a casual drink, while Midtown and the Financial District lean towards a more business crowd. It\''s always cocktail hour at the Dead Rabbit NYC, where the bartenders shake up some vintage cocktails while Maison Premiere is the stylish place for oysters in the outdoors. New York is the very last word in club culture, with places in every corner of the city blasting music all night long. S.O.B.\''s showcases world music, while the Knitting Factory provides a mixed bag of music, spoken word and art. For the hipsters there\''s Niagara.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1470,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Manhattan</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Manhattan, home to the most recognizable sites, dominates popular perception of New York City. Its most famous districts are listed below:</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wall Street & the Financial District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">New York\''s first district remains its most historic. Wall Street investment banks coexist with landmarks like Trinity Church. Battery Park draws people for its panoramic views. The World Trade Center was also one of the area\''s most popular destinations, until its tragic destruction on September 11, 2001, which took the lives of many New Yorkers and affected the entire nation. Here stand the One World Trade Center and the National September 11 Memorial & Museum that\''s open to visitors and commemorates those that lost their lives.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Harlem</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Long the national epicenter of African-American culture, Harlem was home to the Harlem Renaissance, arguably this country\''s most influential artistic, literary and cultural movement. Harlem is known for its jazz clubs and Southern restaurants. The 19th-century brownstone houses share space with newer constructions and this neighborhood\''s trendy eateries, music venues and clubs draw crowds through the weekend. Along 125th Street, the Apollo Theater still hosts a fantastic line up of talent, while local dining institutions like Sylvia\''s are the place to go for real old-fashioned Soul Food.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Greenwich Village</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the turn of the 20th Century, Greenwich Village drew free spirits from around the nation, including poet Edna St. Vincent Millay and playwright Eugene O\''neill. As the years went on, rents inevitably rose. Now, its townhouses are some of the most expensive in the city. New York University students gather here in Washington Square Park. A diverse array of shops, bars and music clubs exist along Bleecker Street. Mosey on over to the Blind Tiger Ale House for a pint or stop by the Le Poisson Rouge for a live show.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">East Village</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Artists, students and young professionals have gone a long way towards gentrifying East Village neighborhood. Even today, the artistic spirit that initially brought about change remains, evident in such vibrant cultural establishments as St. Mark\''s-in-the-Bowery Church. Urban gardens, like Tompkins Square Park and art exhibits sit beside cafes, craft shops and vegetarian restaurants. Cinema buffs will find the Anthology Film Archives with its screening of independent and experimental cinema worth a visit, while music enthusiasts should not miss out on Turntable Lab, a landmark record store that\''s a neighborhood favorite.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Soho & Tribeca</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once home to massive factories, artists moved in and transformed the area into a bustling urban mecca. Galleries, designer shops, sophisticated restaurants and trendy bars followed soon after. Among many others in the area, Locanda Verde stands out for its rustic Italian fare and celeb sightings combined with fresh seasonal cuisine and an upbeat atmosphere. Today, tourists flock to the area and rents have risen sky high.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lower East Side</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This area once housed some of the city\''s worst slums, well-chronicled by the Lower East Side Conservancy. Today\''s higher rents mean that the only people who can afford to live here, and want to, are young professionals. The historic Orchard Street Shopping District is home to several hip bars and nightclubs.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chinatown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Asian restaurants, grocery stores and trinket shops line the ever-crowded streets of Chinatown. Dim Sum and other favorites attract diners on practically every corner, especially on famous Mott Street. Sip on a refreshing bubble tea as you await your table at one of the many budget-friendly and incredibly popular eateries like the Nom Wah Tea Parlor. If you\''ve got a sweet tooth, don\''t miss the traditional baked goods at Tai Pan.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Little Italy</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Frank Sinatra, Italian restaurants and kitsch draw tourists to the lively neighborhood of Little Italy surrounding Mulberry Street. The Feast of San Gennaro still welcomes its throngs, but the neighborhood is fast becoming surrounded by nearby Chinatown.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Gramercy & Flatiron</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The majestic Flatiron Building lords over this beautiful, eclectic district marked by loft spaces to the west and pre-war residences to the east. More than a century after their construction, the apartment buildings and townhouses around Gramercy Park remain coveted residences.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chelsea</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once a working-class community, Chelsea has also become a posh address. As rents in Greenwich Village rose, the vibrant gay community moved upwards to occupy Chelsea\''s many brownstones and loft spaces. Others followed, and today it reflects all of New York\''s ethnic and cultural diversity. West Chelsea is home to many art galleries, and there are a number of great restaurants, such as Cookshop, which serves seasonal American cuisine. Chelsea still retains some reminders of its more conservative past, as evident by the General Theological Seminary and the Church of the Guardian Angel.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Midtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As the name implies, Midtown is smack in the middle of everything. Nobody is really sure where Midtown begins (most would say somewhere at the 30-block), but most agree it stops around Central Park. Publishing houses, financial firms, import/export companies and fashion houses all do business here. Trump Tower entices shoppers, along with all those glorious stores along Fifth Avenue. Ice skaters twirl at Rockefeller Center and the spectacular St. Patrick\''s Cathedral offers serenity and spirituality.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Times Square & Hell\''s Kitchen</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nothing screams New York quite like the neon billboards of Times Square. Some New Yorkers miss the former seediness, however, most people begrudgingly admit that it is better this way. Visitors adore everything from souvenir shops to enormous billboards and Broadway musicals. A few blocks west lies Hell\''s Kitchen, a community filled with eclectic restaurants, such as Five Napkin Burger, bars, shops, and, of course, the Actors Temple.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Upper East Side</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Park, Fifth and Madison have always been posh avenues. Whether in the gilded manors of yesteryear, like Gracie Mansion in Schurz Park, or the area\''s high-rise modern apartments, old money and high society have long made their home here. Consequently, shops to serve them line Madison Avenue. Baby Gap coexists with art galleries and antique shops. Further east, new money has overtaken the old Yorkville slum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Upper West Side</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When the co-ops of the East Side were freer to restrict residents, the Upper West Side became home to new money. Then, as \"modernist\" Eastsiders tore down their pre-war palaces, Upper West Side residents kept their old buildings, such as the famous Ansonia and the Dakota; renters now value the neighborhood\''s attractive real estate. Meanwhile, bars and restaurants catering to Long Island and New Jersey folk (aka, the \"Bridge and Tunnel\" crowd) continue to sprout up along Columbus and Amsterdam avenues. New York\''s four other boroughs each have a distinct identity of their own as well and are worth exploring for their own merits.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Brooklyn</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This massive borough stretches from festive Coney Island to elegant Brooklyn Heights. But wherever Brooklynites hail from, they remain a largely proud lot. They can boast of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, the gorgeous bridge that bears the borough\''s name, the Brooklyn Museum, and a thriving restaurant scene. Don\''t miss a slice at the famous Grimaldi\''s, the line is worth the wait. Brooklyn is also one of the best places to explore the city\''s vibrant live music scene. From alternative and indie bands to top-of-the-charts performers, everyone eventually makes their way to this happening borough. Whether you enjoy mainstream music or enjoy discovering underground acts, you\''ll find it here. The theater scene is also booming here, and alternative and avant-garde groups find a home in Brooklyn\''s upcoming performance spaces. Head the waterfront for some of the best views of the Manhattan skyline. On a warm day, you\''ll be joined by hoards of fellow sun worshippers!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Queens</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From Flushing to Astoria, Queens is experiencing a quiet renaissance, as refugees from Manhattan\''s high rents continue to discover what this working-class borough offers its residents. Inexpensive ethnic restaurants pepper the borough. Queens is also home to the Museum of the Moving Image and Flushing Meadows Corona Park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Bronx</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This borough boasts the Yankees, one of the nation\''s finest zoos, and an extraordinary Botanical Garden. Areas including the South Bronx have benefited from economic booms. Catch a game at the Yankees Stadium, and feel the energy as you cheer on the team. For art fans, the Bronx Museum of the Arts is an innovative address celebrating the works of a multi-ethnic community that calls this borough home. For views along the Harlem River, the historic High Bridge is the place to go. History buffs will find plenty to interest them at the Woodlawn Cemetery that\''s more than a century old. Architectural landmarks and famous personalities abound here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Staten Island</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just a free ferry ride from Manhattan, Staten Island is a fascinating visit, especially for those who enjoy mixing sightseeing with history. From lounging on the beach to exploring Historic Richmond Town and the Snug Harbor Cultural Center & Botanical Garden, there\''s plenty to do here.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

The Oakland Aviation Museum, located at the Oakland International Airport features a collection of vintage aircrafts, as well as several other interesting exhibits. The Pardee Home Museum near Preservation Park, a sort of outdoor museum in itself, features an antique carriage house and tank house.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Historic Landmarks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As Oakland has been around since before the Gold Rush, naturally it is home to many historic buildings and landmarks. Perhaps the greatest of these is the Dunsmuir House & Gardens, a 37 room mansion built on 50 acres in the Oakland Hills. The house, gardens and carriage house play host to numerous events throughout the year. Christmastime at the Dunsmuir is a spectacle not to be missed. In Old Oakland, Preservation Park is a collection of 16 Victorian houses from the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. Centered around a picturesque fountain circle and bandstand, the park shows what Oakland looked like 100 years ago. The Camron-Stanford House offers guided tours at Lake Merritt\''s only remaining historic building, the former home of some of Oakland\''s most wealthy residents in the late 19th Century. Slightly different from a preserved Victorian home is Heinold\''s First & Last Chance Saloon, a National Literary Landmark and a favorite haunt of Oakland author Jack London, Heinold\''s tilted bar still exhibits damage left over from the great earthquake of 1906. The most modern of Oakland\''s architectural landmarks can be seen from most parts of the city, the Oakland California Temple in the Oakland Hills is the main worshiping place of Oakland\''s Mormon population, and the decoration around the holidays illuminates the whole hillside with incredible lights and nativity scenes.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kids & Family Fun</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Oakland has lots to do to entertain the children, along with the whole family. The main kids attraction in Oakland is Children\''s Fairyland, the first child-oriented theme park in the United States, which even provided Walt Disney with some of the inspiration for Disneyland. Fairyland has small rides, animals, play structures and puppet shows, among other fun features. Another family favorite with animals and rides is the Oakland Zoo. Home to all kinds of animals, from elephants to river otters and baboons, as well as a train ride and a sky ride, the Oakland Zoo is a great spot for birthday parties or just a fun day out with the family. Another fun and educational family spot in the Oakland Hills is the Chabot Space & Science Center, which features a number of large public telescopes, a planetarium and more that the kids will love. In the summers you can head out to Alameda for the Sand Castle & Sand Sculpture Contest at Robert W. Crown Memorial State Beach in Alameda, where you can check out these extraordinary temporary creations.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema/Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Oakland is full of all kinds of theaters, both new and old. Probably the most historic theater in the city is the magnificent Paramount Theater, which has been around since the 1930s and is home to the Oakland East Bay Symphony and the Oakland Ballet, as well as hosting special events and concerts, and showing old movies, complete with intermissions on occasion. Oakland\''s other historic live performance theater is the Fox, renovated in the beginning of the 21st Century to its original Art Deco splendor, which hosts concerts and comedians all year round. Oakland\''s most beloved (and historic) movie theater is the Grand Lake Theater, which shows all the latest hits, and features the \"Mighty Wurlitzer Organ\" performances before movies start on Friday nights, along with a raffle. Aside from these historic theaters is the more discreet Piedmont Theatre, which often screens foreign and independent films, and the modern nine screen Regal Jack London Stadium 9.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoors</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Despite being the eighth largest city in California, Oakland has an abundance of outdoor parks and recreation areas to make you forget you\''re surrounded by urbanity. Right in the middle of the city, you can rent a boat at the Lake Merritt Boating Center and drift around this 155 acre landmark, taking in the necklace of lights, or hire a gondolier to tour you around the lake. Merritt isn\''t the only lake in the city, however. You can also visit Lake Temescal for some swimming or fishing for catfish and rainbow trout, or Lake Chabot just a few miles outside the city in Castro Valley, where you can also fish, swim, and boat, or just hang out and relax by the water. You can visit Oakland\''s very own volcanic remains at the Sibley Volcanic Regional Preserve, where you can climb the Round Top peak, comprised of millions of year old volcanic debris, or simply hike or ride a horse on one of the numerous trails that run throughout the park. Another favorite Oakland park is Redwood Regional Park in the Oakland Hills, where you can stroll through the California Redwood trees, go swimming at the pool or barbecue in the Roberts Recreation Area. Also in the hills is Huckleberry Botanic Preserve, where you can meander around looking at native coastal California plants and flowers. If hiking trails and hills aren\''t your cup of tea, you should head over to Alameda and Crown Beach where you can relax on the beach with views of San Francisco.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1490,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown/City Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown Oakland has undergone a sort of revitalization in past years, and is now a thriving and desirable business and cultural center for not only the city, but the whole Bay Area. Oakland\''s downtown encompasses a good amount of historical interest too, with Old Oakland (between Broadway, Clay, Seventh and 10th streets), which features Victorian buildings dating back to the 19th Century, Preservation Park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Uptown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Uptown Oakland is one of the city\''s most active neighborhoods. Uptown has one of the largest concentrations of trendy restaurants, bars and art galleries in the city, and has since Oakland started really revitalizing in the early 2000s. The area is home to many popular entertainment venues as well, like the historic Paramount and Fox Theaters and the New Parkway Theater. Some of the popular eateries and watering holes include Flora, Luka\''s Taproom and Dogwood. Uptown is also the site of Oakland\''s flourishing Arts District, which is home to numerous galleries like the Johansson Projects and Mercury 20, and is also the site of Oakland\''s monthly First Friday festival, which takes place (as the name implies) on the first Friday of every month.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Jack London Square</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the most popular attractions in Oakland, Jack London Square, is located along the waterfront, at the end of Broadway. Named after the famed <em>Call of the Wild</em> author Jack London, the charming waterfront promenade is home to the cabin in which the author lived during his time in Alaska (now relocated, of course), which sightseers can now visit and toss a coin in for luck. Right next door, you can visit the oldest bar in Oakland, where Jack London himself used to spend time, Heinold\''s First and Last Chance Saloon. A beautiful shopping and nightlife district with views of the bay and Alameda Island, Jack London Square offers a host of entertainment, shopping and dining opportunities, most notably the well-known Yoshi\''s restaurant and jazz club. Jack London Square is also the home to several modern loft buildings as well as Oakland\''s Amtrak train station and ferry terminal.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chinatown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Oakland\''s Chinatown is one of the oldest and most authentic Chinatowns in the United States, dating back to the mid-19th Century. Located right next to downtown, the borders of Chinatown run from 12th Street in the north, to Oak Street to the east, I-880 in the south and the entrance to the Webster Tube (to Alameda). Chinatown includes a more residential section as well as a bustling commercial section, which centers mainly around the Pacific Renaissance Plaza at 10th and Webster Streets, and includes almost every kind of shop imaginable, as well as some incredible food at places like Golden Lotus and Shan Dong. Although called Chinatown, the area is actually an incredibly diverse Pan-Asian community, with residents hailing from everywhere from Japan and Korea to Vietnam and Cambodia.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lake Merritt</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lake Merritt was originally the United States\'' first wildlife refuge, and today is an Oakland landmark, around which many bustling smaller areas are centered. The Lake Merritt neighborhood includes Grand Avenue, best known for the historic Grand Lake Theater with its Mighty Wurlitzer Organ and unabashed political marquee statements, as well as Lakeshore Avenue, which is packed full of great restaurants and shopping, and Adams Point, a mostly residential area. The lake also serves as a popular walking or hiking route, totaling 3.5 miles around. The lake is also surrounded by various parks as well as Laney College, and the Oakland Museum of California. If you\''re with the young ones, check out Children\''s Fairyland, America\''s oldest fairy-tale theme park. And don\''t miss Lake Merritt at night, when you can see its necklace of lights reflecting on the water.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Piedmont Avenue</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Named after the neighboring city of Piedmont, which is somewhat of an island city completely surrounded by Oakland, Piedmont Avenue is a charming, slightly upscale dining and shopping district. Also home to the Oakland branch of Kaiser Permanente Hospital, the neighborhood is generally accepted as being bordered by Broadway, Oakland Avenue, the City of Piedmont and the Mountain View Cemetery. Piedmont Avenue is where you will find the famous (thanks to Pixar) Fenton\''s Creamery. Aside from eating, there is also an abundance of small boutique shops, as well as the Piedmont Theatre.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rockridge/College Avenue</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rockridge/College Avenue Shopping District has everything: cute shops, boutiques, markets and restaurants stretching for almost a mile from Alcatraz Street until College Avenue ends at The California College of Arts campus; homes run west towards the freeway and east into the hills. Cute without being cloying, bustling Rockridge is a vital and in-demand neighborhood with one of the most bustling commercial districts in the East Bay.  Food is king in Rockridge: The European-influenced Rockridge Market Hall is a labyrinth of stalls selling exquisite stuffed pastas, olive oil, imported cheese, fresh-baked bread, teas, coffees, fish, wine, meat, beautiful produce, and flowers. La Farine is another longtime Rockridge bakery with an ardent following. Oliveto Cafe & Restaurant, Zachary\''s Chicago Pizza and other Rockridge restaurants have left their mark on the Bay Area\''s culinary map as well. Shopping is another Rockridge specialty. Visit Diesel for books and various literary events while Maison d\''etre stocks elegant yet accessible home goods.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Temescal</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">What was once a rather run-down, unexciting area, has been transformed into the ever growing and popular Temescal district. Now known as Oakland\''s Gourmet Ghetto, up and coming chefs and brewers flock to this area around Telegraph Avenue and 51st Street to set up shop. Innovative restaurants like Pizzaiolo and Doña Tomas mingle with beloved Temescal bites like Bakesale Betty and craft beer tap rooms and breweries to create a vibrant neighborhood which is home to hipsters, and yuppies alike.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Montclair</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Montclair District, which encompasses both residential areas as well as the central Montclair Business District, also known as Montclair Village, is situated at the base of the Oakland Hills and up, and is bordered by Highways 24 and 13, Skyline Boulevard and Joaquin Miller Road. Besides being a nice, compact and walkable area to stroll or shop in, Montclair also features Montclair Park, complete with a large pond home to numerous ducks, as well as several unique play structures for the kids. Situated right next to the park is the historic firehouse designed by famed Bay Area architect Julia Morgan, in the Hansel and Gretel style. In fact, Montclair is home to many fairy-tale inspired buildings, which can be seen all over in the village, as well as farther up into the hills. Montclair is also home to many boutique stores and great restaurants.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Oakland Hills/Mills</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mostly residential, the hills of Oakland over to the area around Mills College (a historic all woman\''s college which dates back to the founding of Oakland), boast incredible views of the San Francisco Bay and city at all hours of the day and night. However, despite its mostly residential status, the Hills are home to several not-to-miss attractions such as the Oakland Zoo, the Dunsmuir House & Gardens and the Chabot Space & Science Center, among others.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Airport</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The flatlands around the Oakland International Airport are home to various travel-convenient hotels, as well as the Oracle Arena & Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, home to the Oakland Athletics baseball team, Oakland Raiders NFL team, and the Golden State Warriors basketball team. And while this area is not as attraction packed as other areas of the city, it does contain a fairly large concentration of accommodations convenient to the airport, and catching an Oakland sporting event is an exciting experience you won\''t easily find elsewhere.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The expansive complex is made up of several miles of rides, entertainment shows, and demonstrations, with some of the most spectacular thrills and special effects you will find anywhere in the world. There are numerous opportunities for shopping, eating and relaxation here as well at the Universal Citywalk. Another option located only a few minutes from Osaka Station in the Hep Five shopping mall is the Umeda Joypolis, where there are a number of small-scale thrill rides at reasonable prices. In the same building, positioned on the roof, there is the enormous Hep Five Ferris Wheel that rises some 340-feet above central Osaka. Spa World is a uniquely Japanese theme park that brings together Japanese spa or <em>onsen</em> culture in an international-style theme park format. The saunas each have an individual theme inspired by international destinations like Ancient Rome, Atlantis, Persia and Bali.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Another entertainment possibility with universal appeal, especially among Osaka residents, is the Osaka City Dome, where the Orix Buffaloes, demonstrate why they are among the nation\''s top contenders. Take a seat in the rowdy bleachers for an unforgettable experience. Japanese baseball fans are incredibly spirited, and Osaka\''s fans are notoriously noisy and rambunctious. Only 15 minutes west of Umeda Station, just over the Hyogo prefecture border, is the home stadium of the Hanshin Tigers baseball team, Hanshin Koshien Stadium.Sports in Osaka are hardly limited to baseball, however. Although their popularity does not quite surpass that of the local baseball teams, Cerezo Osaka and Gamba Osaka are two professional J-League soccer teams that command quite an energetic following. Each team has its own stadium, and loyalties in Osaka are fiercely divided between the two.  Besides baseball and soccer, there are also dozens of other sporting events you can catch throughout the year at the Osaka Dome and other venues. These include a yearly sumo tournament, professional kick boxing and pro wrestling matches, among others. Those wishing to participate in sports are best advised to pay a visit to the Osaka Pool in Minami-ku which has world-class facilities for competition swimming that are open to the public all year, and ice skating in the Winter.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music and Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On a more cultural level, Osaka is well-known for its live entertainment, both music and theater. One of the more prestigious locations to catch live music is the Billboard Live Osaka the best, R&B, blues, pop and rock bands headline.  A few other popular live houses where you can catch some high-energy rock shows include Shinsaibashi Muse Hall and jazz and blues in Mr. Kelly\''s. For easier listening, the Big Cat in the Big Step shopping center frequently hosts musicals and classical concerts, and for the best live comedy acts, Nanba Grand Kagetsu is legendary. Numerous comedians and drama acts that are now rooted deeply in Japanese popular culture made their debuts here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For those looking for an educational day out, Osaka is a great pick. For Japanese, Chinese and Korean art, try the Municipal Museum of Fine Art.  Another option is to spend an afternoon viewing the fascinating displays of world culture at the National Museum of Ethnology, or to gain some insight into ancient Japanese culture at the Osaka Prefectural Museum of Yayoi Culture. The National Museum of Art, with its contemporary displays also comes highly recommended.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once the sun sets, Osaka turns into quite the party town, and streets, populated with a plethora of bars and clubs fill with young professionals, businessmen and tourists looking to unwind. There is something for everyone here, whether its craft beer, fine sake, or fancy cocktails. From speakeasy-style bars like Bar Nayuta to specialty bars like Café Absinthe and beer bars like Kamikaze, you\''re sure to find your poison of choice. Among the many options, sports bars like Balabushka and British-style pubs like Covent Garden have earned a cult following. If you are looking for some simple, free entertainment in the form of people-watching, then the best place for you is the \"American Village,\" or Ame-mura. This area, comprising several square blocks of the Shinsaibashi, is jammed with shopping centers and retail outlets, restaurants and bars, and people from all walks of life, more than you will find anywhere else in the city. It is here, among all the diversity, that you realize Osaka is indeed one of the world\''s largest cities and a delightfully entertaining one at that!</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1508,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Umeda</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The central business district is at the northern hub of Umeda, just three stops south on the Midosuji subway line from the Shin-Osaka bullet-train station. A conglomeration of businesses, deluxe hotels, retail high-rises and, at night, countless karaoke bars full of red-nosed \"salary men,\" Umeda is as close as the city gets to the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. The numerous international hotels that have sprung up over the past few years make Umeda the natural choice for the business traveler or adventure-seeking tourist who wants to travel in comfort. The district is also served by several train and subway lines.  Inside Hankyu Station is the mammoth bookstore Kinokuniya, which is well stocked with English titles, as well as magazines and newspapers. Check out Hankyu\''s new Hep Five shopping, restaurant and cinema complex with its built-in Hep Five Ferris Wheel. Behind HEP Five, you will find the nightlife district of Doyama-cho, which is full of restaurants, love hotels and gay bars.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shinsaibashi</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Three stops south, the Midosuji subway line will bring you to Shinsaibashi, the center of Osaka\''s youth scene. Be sure to stop by Triangle Park in the center of Ame-mura (American Village). The park itself is unremarkable, but it is the starting point for exploring the clothing stores, record shops, cafes, restaurants, bars and clubs, knick-knack stores, and of course, the hip youth that give this area its special color.  Go a little further west to Yotsubashi-suji Street and Naniwa-suji Street, two boulevards running parallel to Midosuji; all <em>suji</em> run north-south and all <em>dori</em> run east to west. On and between these thoroughfares and running north up to Minami Semba you will find an array of newly established boutiques, jewelery stores, health shops, ethnic shops and bars, cafes and restaurants that cater to a more chic and yuppie crowd.  The east side of the tree-lined main boulevard of Midosuji is dominated by Daimaru department store. Behind Daimaru is the famous Dotombori Bridge, also known as Nampa-bashi or Hikkake-bashi (that is, \"Pick-Up Bridge\") in reference to its reputation as a place for liaisons. You will recognize it by the legendary Glico Man neon sign, and the equally well-known crab shop Kanidoraku Honten located at its southern end. Almost in front of you, at the bridge, you will see another famous landmark, Shin Kabukiza, Osaka\''s main kabuki theater.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Namba and Dotonbori</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Namba is the next subway stop south, and by walking just a couple of minutes further down, you will get to Nankai Railway\''s Namba Station with its gigantic, brown, modern Swissotel Nankai. The Nankai Line heading south of here runs on top of a long shopping mall that offers a staggering array of goods and services. Also, behind the station on the next east-west road to the south is the Hard Rock Cafe Osaka.  If you walk southeast from Namba to Sakai-suji, or take the Sennichimae subway line one stop to Nipponbashi, you will arrive at Osaka\''s discount electronics mile, the place for cameras, computers, stereos and electrical appliances. At the end of Sakai-suji is Osaka\''s rather clumsy but nationally famous answer to the Eiffel Tower, Tsutenkaku Tower, which was the tallest structure in Asia at the time of its construction in 1912. Dotonbori is a few-minutes walk from the Namba Station. This area is one of the city\''s most vibrant neighborhoods, packed with restaurants, bars, shops and entertainment venues. Straddling either side of the Dotonbori-gawa Canal, this neighborhood is an ecclectic mix of over-the-top neon signage and funky lighting and peaceful cobbled streets leading to the 17th-century Hozen-ji Temple.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Tennoji</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The next stop south is Osaka\''s southernmost hub, Tennoji, which is home to a large concentration of places to shop, eat and drink, both ancient and modern. These include Kintetsu Department Store, Tennoji MIO, the Kinei Apollo Building, Lucius, and the shops that line Abeno-suji, a street that boasts the city\''s last remaining tram line. One of Japan\''s tallest skyscrapers, Abeno Harukas is located here. This soaring landmark is home to the Harukas 300 Observatory Deck, offering 360-degree views over Osaka, Kobe, Wakayama and the Inland Sea. Nearby are Tennoji Park, the city\''s refurbished Zoological Gardens, and the National Art Museum. On the slope between Matsuyamachi-suji (think motorbike shops) and Tanimachi-suji is the main concentration of shrines and temples. Do not miss the avant-garde Isshinji Temple and the grand Shitenno-ji Temple, reputedly the nation\''s oldest. Mixed amongst these you will not be able to ignore the scores of love hotels, often notable for their far-fetched and wacky decor. The surrounding area of Shinsekai (\"New World\") is a neighborhood characterized by a retro vibe. Once the city\''s major entertainment district, with its Parisian and New York influences highlighted in the period architecture, the area fell into disuse for decades. Today, with a growing number of bars, cafes and restaurants, the area is once again on the rise, though it still retains its offbeat character.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Osaka Castle</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For some more ancient history, visit Osaka Castle, the seat of Japan\''s unifying lord, Hideyoshi Toyotomi. Nearby is Kyobashi, home to Osaka Business Park. A walk around the river between Kyobashi and Tenma is worth it for the peaceful riverside paths and the elegant old buildings.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Osaka Bay Area</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Finally, for a day of fun with a bit of sea air there is the modern harbor area. The massive Osaka Aquarium can be found here and the sheer size and variety of its sea life and interactive exhibits makes it a popular spot for tourists, especially those with kids. For views over the bay, take the Tempozan Ferris Wheel which is especially magical at night and ideal for a date. Another attraction in this happening area is the Universal Studios Japan, an amusement park with a number of attractions, rides, and entertainment venues within its confines.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Specialty cinemas include Gimle, a west end spot known for showing European or Turkish films, and Christiania Teater, which shows famous films as well as new and alternative cinema in connection with festivals or theme weeks. Depending on where you are in the city, you can also go to the grand Colosseum at Majorstuen or Vika.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Another thing for kids to enjoy is the Norwegian Technical Museum in Nydalen. It may sound boring, but it is made almost like theme park with lots of fun things to play with. You are expected to touch everything, run around, and just be a child having fun—and that goes for the adults, too. At Bygdøy, there is the Vikingskiphuset and Kon-Tiki. Botanisk Hage will be fun as well. At Sjølystsenteret there are always different trade fairs like the Fashion Week or Sjølystmarkedet.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Concerts & Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Oslo Concert Hall is the home ground of the renowned Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, but any big orchestra would perform here. Sometimes there are pop or rock concerts here with grown-up audiences and mature artists. Smaller concerts are arranged at Norsk Musikkhøgskole, where admission is usually free because the performers are students and the standard is surprisingly good. Den Norske Opera is extremely popular, so make sure you reserve your tickets a long time in advance of the shows. Many concerts, especially organ concerts, are also held at Oslo Cathedral. At Valle Hovin, there are big outdoor concerts with artists that can draw audiences of 40,000 people. The biggest indoor venue is Oslo Spektrum. It is perfect for large concerts as well as raves, intimate clubs and sports events. Rockefeller is the music hall most people relate to. The venue is of a size that makes it easy for the artists to communicate well with the audience, and that is why many artists give their very best at Rockefeller. When there are no concerts, the house is used for cult movies, raves, clubbing—whatever entertains young, urban people. In the basement is a small place called John Dee that has theme nights in connection with the concerts at Rockefeller, as well as hosting new, exciting, unknown bands.Those who enjoy jazz, trip-hop, or anything new and alternative must check out Blå. After just a few years, it has become established as the most important, innovative and thrilling scene in town. There are regular concerts with both Norwegian and foreign talents and often a few surprises. The standards are always high. Exhibitions, happenings, and theme nights are also arranged at Blå. If none of the above are happening, you can just chill out with a beer and enjoy the tasteful music from the DJ. There are always shows on some of the many stages in the house: stand-up comedy, cabaret, blues, folk, rock—you name it. It is a bit mainstream, but the performers are always good. Many celebrities like to spend all their spare time here.In the way of music festivals, Norwegian Wood is an annual rock festival that will remind you of a picnic with great musicians. Headliners are not limited to local musicians, and the likes of Johnny Cash, Neil Young, John Mayer, and Arcade Fire have all grace the stage. Otherwise, Oslo Jazzfestival makes for a great excuse to party and listen to good music. It also stages workshops, kids\'' programs, and more.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">We highly recommend a day in Frognerparken, where the great sculptures of Gustav Vigeland are on permanent display. Here you can play with frisbees and balls or just relax in the grass. On your way to the beautiful green areas surrounding Oslo, you should visit Frognerseteren, a great restaurant and nice café high above the city. North of that area, you will find Holmenkollen, the famous ski jump. Ullevål Stadium hosts many major and minor sporting events. In the winter, you can go ice-skating and dancing on a beautifully lit spot in the middle of the main street to the sound of <em>Last Christmas</em> by Wham!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Family Outings</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Enjoy an action-packed day by taking the free bus to the amusement park TusenFryd just outside the city. Not only does it offer a perfect day out for the entire family, but <em>TusenFryd</em> even translates \"a thousand pleasures\" in English. Head roughly 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) south of Oslo to get there, and let the thrilling park tell you the rest!</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1518,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">City Center & Karl Johans Gate</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">All your transport and information needs can be met right in the city center, where you can easily access much of the city\''s history and metropolitan life once you are situated. The city\''s transport hub is Oslo Central Station. The main bus terminal is situated diagonally across the street.Walking west from the station, you will find the Karl Johans Gate, Oslo\''s most famous and pedestrian-friendly parade street. On your right as you walk up the sloping hill is Oslo Cathedral, dating from the late-17th century. It is open daily and free of charge. Further up Karl Johan, past shops, restaurants and pubs, you will find the Parliament of Norway on the left-hand side, boasting original Neo-Romanesque architecture. And across the street, the five-star Grand Hotel has greeted its guests in style for more than a century. The hotel\''s Grand Café has been a favorite haunt of famous Norwegian artists, including the playwright Henrik Ibsen.The little green spot of Studenterlunden on the other side has an open-air restaurant and a large pond, which becomes a very popular ice rink in the winter. At the end of the road is the Neo-Classical Nationaltheatret built in 1899 and guarded by the statues of Henrik Ibsen and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. In addition to a magnificent Rococo theater seating 800 people, Nationaltheatret has its own gallery with a unique collection of portraits. Back on the other side of Karl Johan, you find the oldest part of the University of Oslo, built in 1852.Just a short walk up Universitetsgaten, the most extensive collection of art in Norway is on display at the National Gallery. You can see work by famous Norwegian artists such as Edvard Munch, Christian Krohg and J.C. Dahl, as well as international names like Picasso, El Greco, Matisse and Van Gogh. Karl Johans Gate runs all the way up to the Royal Palace built by the eponymous 19th-century king, Karl Johan, who ruled the union of Sweden and Norway. Strolling in Slottsparken, the royal gardens surrounding the palace, you can discover memorable statues, enjoy a picnic, or take a nap in the shade of a tree. Akershus Fortress stands guard at the harbor. This was originally a residence for kings, but 1592, it was remodeled to become a fortress armed with cannons. Today you can find the famous author Henrik Wergeland\''s office, the Castle Church, the Royal Mausoleum and the Resistance Museum inside the fortress. The army still uses parts of the fortress, so you can see the daily changing of the guards here. At the waterfront, you can also find the main Tourist Office. Further along the pier, Aker Brygge beckons with its exclusive shops, restaurants, pubs and bars. It\''s probably the most packed area of Oslo in the summer!Further back on shore, Akershusstranda runs uptown past the Astrup Fearnley Museum of modern art. Temporary exhibitions show predominantly post-war art, and the museum keeps a permanent collection, as well. On your way out, stop by Christiania Torv where the immense statue of King Christian IV\''s glove in the center of the square points out the spot where he decided to rebuild the city after a disastrous fire in 1624.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Frogner, Uranienborg & Majorstuen</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the west of the city center, you\''ll head into Frogner, named after the vast 18th-century estate of Frogner Manor that now houses the Oslo City Museum. Including the traditional town of Frogner, this large borough also spans over the city districts of Uranienborg and Majorstuen. Frogner Park contains the Vigeland Sculpture Park and Museum, the most visited tourist attractions in Oslo. Do not miss this amazing collection of 212 larger-than-life granite and bronze sculptures, representing all stages of life. Even the park gardens themselves are masterfully sculpted, providing pleasant, leisurely walks for visitors amidst always-in-season greens.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bygdøy</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the harbor of the city center, you can also take a ferry to Bygdøy and Dronningen, technically considered part of Frogner but distinct in its own right. This is where the five most popular museums of Oslo are located, the open-air Norwegian Folk Museum being the largest. It contains architectural examples of more than 150 old original buildings from all over Norway, including a stave church. There is also a large collection of traditional costumes, furniture, silverware, jewelry and artifacts. The Viking Ship Museum is just a short stroll away and features three ritual ships in which Viking kings and queens were once buried. Three other museums are located at Bygdøynes. At the Kon-Tiki Museum, you can see the papyrus boats <em>Ra I</em> and <em>Ra II</em>, and the <em>Kon-Tiki</em> raft, which the well-known explorer and anthropologist Thor Heyerdahl created for his oceanic voyages to prove his theories on the spread of ancient civilizations. The Fram Museum is dedicated to Arctic explorers Roald Amundsen and Fritjof Nansen and their polar ship <em>Fram</em>. You might also want to take a look at the recently renovated Norwegian Maritime Museum located next door.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Grünerløkka</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Grünerløkka is probably the most modern, trendiest area of Oslo. If nothing else it is definitely a top destination for younger locals and travelers looking to party. The area is littered with bars, restaurants, and nightclubs, providing a social hotspot for those looking for some high-energy fun while in Oslo. But there\''s an echo of much history here, as well, being that Grünerløkka was once the 19th-century working class zone of Oslo. Despite the industrial feel having moved out, there\''s still a lot of culture to be witnessed here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Gamle Oslo & Oslofjord</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Oslo stretches far outside the main city center into the cold northern terrains, as well as further south and into the bay of the Oslofjord. Below the Akershus Fortress, where Akershusstranda road leads to Vippetangen quay, boats frequently depart for the islands of the inner Oslofjord, all part of the Gamle Oslo, or Old Oslo, borough. The trip across takes between five and 30 minutes, depending on which island you would like to visit.At Hovedøya, you will find the ruins of a Cistercian monastery built by monks from Kirkstead, England, during the 12th century. Back on shore, Gamle Oslo also includes the neighborhoods of Grønland, Helsfyr and Tøyen, to name a few. Tøyen particularly overflows with museums, including the Munch Museet dedicated to Norwegian symbolist Edvard Munch, as well as the Zoologisk Museum and Paleontologisk Museum, both housed in the gardens of the illustrious Botanisk Hage og Museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Holmenkollen & Greater Oslo</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You have not seen Oslo unless you have been to Holmenkollen, a professional arena for international skiing events every winter. Finish your day enjoying the panoramic views of the modest city of Oslo and the Oslofjord from the famous ski jump tower. If you don\''t dare to exit the tower on a pair of skis, take the elevator back down and try out the three-dimensional ski simulator to safely experience an Olympic event.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (1527,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Those who come to Oxford to appreciate the cultural side of an ancient academic institution will doubtless venture into one of the City\''s many museums. The most traditional of these is the internationally famous Ashmolean Museum in Beaumont Street, which houses antiques, art galleries, and an extensive coin collection. The University Museum on Parks Road is a natural history museum, filled with fossils and remnants of prehistoric creatures. Accessible through the back of the University Museum is the Pitt Rivers Museum, which is home to the more weird and wonderful side of science - a must for kids of all ages, as well as those fascinated by gory sights!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Given its host of undergraduates, many of whom fancy themselves as budding thespians, Oxford has several playhouses and theaters. While most of these host primarily student productions, the Apollo Theatre focuses on outside talent. As well as many musicals, the theater also attracts the odd stand-up comedian: Steve Coogan and Eddie Izzard have both performed there in the last few years. For more regular, although not quite as famed comedy shows, Jongleurs on Hythe Bridge Street is the only official comedy club. Most nights have stand-up, but as only a few of the acts are well known, it\''s more a case of luck of the draw than going to see someone you love. Having said that, once the show\''s over, the disco lights come on and it\''s time to get grooving. Really as much of a nightclub as a comedy club, Jongleurs can pull in some top class DJs.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music and Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The music scene in Oxford has branched out greatly over the last few years. Having given birth to indie bands Radiohead and Supergrass, there\''s always been a great Indie/Rock music scene, particularly at the Oxford Brookes Student Union and the Zodiac on the Cowley Road. As for clubbing, Oxford has always been a haven for 70s and 80s music, which is kept alive by the hordes of students, all eager to try out the groovy moves that only John Travolta can really pull off in style. For those into less mainstream music, the Zodiac regularly plays host to the country\''s top drum \''n\'' bass DJs. The O2 Academy Oxford welcomes local talent in tow packed-to-the-rafters spaces with tribute bands and British talent taking the top spot. Another long-standing favorite on the local music scene is The Jericho Tavern where Radiohead first performed!Oxford\''s highest concentration of watering holes are along the ever-busy George Street. Known for its shops, bars, and cafes, this is where most descend for a night out on the town. Thanks to the city\''s long-standing historical legacy, there are more than a few traditional pubs that have been around for centuries, offering a typical pub experience like The Bear Inn. Some of the most popular nightlife spots include the student favorite, Turf Tavern, where you can pop in for a pint of real ale while upscale spots like the Duke of Cambridge serve crafted cocktails in an elegant space.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While shopping isn\''t the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Oxford, the city has a fair share of places you can indulge in retail therapy. From the shops and boutiques around the vibrant High Street to the local stalls filled with regional produce, farm-fresh food, fragrant pastries and handcrafted products in the historic Covered Market, you\''ll find plenty to explore.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinemas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are four cinemas in Oxford: the Odeon Magdalen Street, the Odeon George Street, The Phoenix, and the Ultimate Picture Palace. While the first two show all the Hollywood blockbusters, the latter tend to show more unusual films, such as cult classics and foreign films, though the Ultimate Picture Palace often shows blockbusters a short timw after their original release.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Recreation</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the summer, there are few better sources of entertainment in Oxford than punting. This pastime involves using a long pole to push and glide your punt, yourself, and your passengers along the river. Usually undertaken by experienced undergraduates who will swig away at a bottle of wine whilst deftly avoiding a protruding branch, punting is actually quite difficult - your first attempt will probably consist of you turning round in circles while onlookers chuckle. If not brave enough to risk being the source of amusement for other punters, don\''t worry, the numerous parks in and around Oxford will provide ample open-air activity for those sunny days. Southpark at the end of St Clement\''s provides a beautiful, scenic view of Oxford\''s dreaming spires, while Christ Church meadow can be the start of a very pleasant walk along the banks of the river Isis.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1528,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Central Oxford</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Central Oxford is, not surprisingly, compact, but many neighborhoods on the outskirts of the town, away from the university, are worth visiting. The most central point of <!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->Oxford is the Carfax, at the crossroads of the High Street, Cornmarket Street, St. Aldate\''s, and Queen Street. The first of these, along with Broad Street which runs parallel to it, are perhaps the two most typically \''oxford\'' streets in the City. Both of them are lined with Oxford Colleges, among them University College, Balliol College, Trinity College, and All Souls College. Other architectural splendors abound along these two central streets, including two of Oxford\''s most famous sights - the domes of the Radcliffe Camera and the Sheldonian Theatre, built by Sir Christopher Wren. It is not just these specific buildings which are worth looking at, however; make sure you don\''t miss the general architecture in central Oxford, where little seems to have been built more recently than a few hundred years ago. Even the shops, restaurants and offices would seem totally out of place in any modern city. Make sure you take the odd glance skyward; Oxford is famous for its Gothic gargoyles and spires.Towards the west end of High Street, a few shops can be found, but the principle shopping area is around Cornmarket Street and Queen Street, with the Covered Market especially suitable for all those in search of quintessentially Oxford gifts. But fanatical vegetarians be warned; there are several butchers in the Covered Market so be sure to watch where you trod.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Headington and Jericho</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Continue up the pedestrianized Cornmarket and you will come to St. Giles, which then forks into Woodstock Road and Banbury Road, both of which take you up to North Oxford and the wealthy suburbs. By taking a right off Banbury Road and down Keble Road, you can find the University Parks, where College or university sports teams can often be seen in action. In the summer, countless undergraduates may be found, lazing around and procrastinating. Continue through the Parks and you\''ll end up fairly near Headington, home of Oxford Brookes University in North East Oxford. West of St Giles we find the area of Jericho. As far as central Oxford goes, this is possibly the most chic residential area.St. Aldates has a few more shops, but exists primarily as the route South out of Oxford, though the Town Hall and Christ Church, among others, can also be found down here. Head a little way down this road and you\''ll come to the Isis River; actually, the Thames, though it\''s not called that locally. All year round you can see students training on the river, and may even catch a glimpse of Oxford\''s world famous (though usually beaten in recent years!) Blues rowing crew, who slog it out against Cambridge in the annual Oxford v Cambridge Boat Race.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cowley</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The bulk of students who don\''t live in their Colleges tend to live on or just off the Cowley Road, reached by heading East along the High Street, and over Magdalen Bridge. The Cowley Road epitomizes the bohemian side of Oxford, home as it is to a hodgepodge of bars, restaurants, clubs and shops. From trendy cocktail bars to gloomy, empty pubs; from classy restaurants to filthy-looking greasy spoons; from bizarre shops that sell nothing in particular (and yet miraculously stay in business), to high street supermarkets, the Cowley Road has it all. Well worth a visit.Instead of going down the Cowley Road off the Magdalen roundabout, take the next turn and head down the Iffley Road. You\''ll soon come to the Oxford University Sports Centre, where Roger Bannister first ran his record breaking four minute mile. On a Wednesday or Saturday afternoon between October and April, you may also see Oxford\''s other internationally-recognized sports team - the Blues rugby team.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Central North Oxford and Summertown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This affluent neighborhood is where the historic St John\''s College is found. Characterized by stately Victorian Gothic homes, this is one of the most prestigious locales in the city.

There is also a splendid summer programme called \"Palermo di Scena\", which offers films and plays as well as nature and photography exhibitions, and concerts (both classical and non), all of which are hosted in some of the most beautiful, ancient villas in Palermo, such as Villa Trabia, Villa Filippina and Villa Lampedusa.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theatre</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">—The theatrical tradition in Palermo has always been very rich and diverse, a mixture of Arabic, Norman, French and Spanish cultures. Street theatre that is performed today, such as the typical <em>vastasata</em>, still reflects Sicilian cabaret and folklore, while the Teatro dei Pupi (puppet theatre) remains faithful to its ancient roots. The theatre scene is varied in summer and winter, and the programmes offered by Teatro Massimo and Teatro Politeama stand out amongs the rest, these being the two main theatres in the Sicilian capital.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Opera</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Teatro Massimo, has recently returned to its ancient splendor, it is certainly the temple of opera and ballet because it has the largest stage in the world. Inaugurated in 1897, it is one of the grandest theatres in Europe and plays host to the most important operas and the most prestigious names in the opera world. The Teatro Politeama (separated from Teatro Massimo by the Via Ruggero Settimo located in the heart of the centre), took over from the Massimo during its restoration and today hosts a rich programme of operas and concerts. The Teatro di Verdura is also a theatre worth visiting.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Classical music and symphonies</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Teatro Golden specializes in symphonies and chamber music, and offers a season of concerts, including superb choral programmes. Many important musical companies perform optimum concerts here. The \"Friends of Music\" and the E. A Sicilian Symphonic Orchestra offer splendid symphonic seasons as well as chamber music seasons, while \"Brass Group\" specializes in jazz music and popular tunes. Prestigious musical societies offer a varied and renowned concert season.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Prosa</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Teatro Biondo offers a season glowing with great performances and shows, from October to June, this is seen as the most important theatre for \"prosa\" in Palermo. Other theatres such as Teatro Al Massimo, Teatro Crystal and Teatro Don Orione, offer exciting programmes (the latter specializes in cabaret). We have already mentioned Teatro dei Pupi, and there are other theatres that offer plays in dialect or depicting ancient folklore, who have performances mainly during the summer eg Teatro Tenda Vito Zappalà and you can catch experimental theatre/ modern dance from Cantieri Culturali alla Zisa, can be seen in the vicinity of the splendid castle and at Teatro Libero.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Some of Palermo\''s most important cinemas have been restored in recent years, these include: the Imperia and Finocchiaro, which was a rather run down place offering second showings. Now, Palermo has over 20 screens showing new releases, and its cinematographic programme can now be defined as complete and satisfactory, even it does not have any multiplexes. Cinemas worth a mention are: Fiamma, Astoria Rouge et Noir, the Metropolitan and Tiffany, large cinemas with lots of seats, with great sound systems and excellent screens, there is also Aurora, which also shows prestigious and popular art house films.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Palermo by night</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It is important for people who work during the week to be able to have a great deal of choice during their \"days of freedom\", picking anything from the most tranquil of activities to the wildest nights of fun, so that all their demands can be satisfied. Palermo has a large number of \"locali\" (nightspots), which can be found throughout the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cafés</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you want a quiet, yet cheerful evening sipping a drink or a coffee with your friends, enjoying the background music, there are plenty of places to choose from, some of which are really traditional. The majority of the cafés are located in the historical center. The Caffè d\''oriente and Caffè Turco are two places that are famous for their Arabic drinks, while the Caffè Antico and Caffè del Cassaro are renowned for traditional Sicilian beverages. The New Orleans Café is also worth trying.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pubs and Beer-houses</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">-</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Live Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As in all the other cities, in the last twenty years a large number of \"locali\" have appeared in the Sicilian capital, so that you can spend the evening having fun. The wide variety and the distribution of these places throughout the area gives residents and visitors alike the possibility to choose between pubs, beer-houses, and discos, where there are lots of new friends to be made. If you prefer something a little less noisy, with great background music, so that you can chat to your friends and enjoy excellent service at the same time, why not try Birreria Kovacs, which also offers a Hungarian menu. Au Domino is a historical pub in Via Principe di Belmonte, and Agricantus, has various shows and entertainment, or how about Cambio Cavalli, one of the first pubs in Palermo? If you prefer live Italian, American, English and South American music then Crazy Bull is probably the place for you, decorated in traditional American style. You may want to try the Carlotta Pub or the Villa Niscemi close to the Villa of the same name. New singers get a chance to shine at the Bier Garten and the Malox, which also allows its clients to use the internet.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Discos</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Amongst the popular discos in the area, the most important (without doubt) are Kandisky Florio in the ancient district of Arenella, the Anticlea Pub and the Kursaal Kalesa Club (located along the promenade of the Foro Italico) and the Country Club, which is great in the summer season, when it has large open-air dance floors. Not forgetting the famous discos in the Province such as La Conchiglia and the Palatime on the Isola delle Femmine.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The piazza is framed on four sides by semi-circular facades of baroque palazzi, each adorned with statues representing Spanish kings, the seasons, and local female saints. Situated at the intersection of Corso Vittorio Emanuele and Via Maqueda, it\''s also where the city\''s four oldest neighborhoods meet: La Kalsa, Vucciria, il Capo, and Albergheria. Most of the city\''s top monuments are located nearby.La Kalsa was Palermo\''s medieval Arab district, built during the Muslim domination of Sicily. The name Kalsa comes from the old Arabic \"Khalisa,\" meaning \"pure.\" Once rundown and a bit dangerous, it\''s undergone a significant revival in recent decades, with palazzi being restored and new generations of urban hipsters moving in. Wine bars, or enoteche have followed them, including QVIVI Music Bar and Cana Enoteca. Palazzo Abatellis, a 16th-century Catalan Gothic-style palace on Via Alloro, houses the Galleria Regionale della Sicilia (Gallery of the Sicily Region), dedicated to art from the Sicilian region. Several other palazzi, including the Bonagia, Zingone Trabia, and Chiaramonte Steri, are in the neighborhood, as well as the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi and Santa Maria dell\''ammiraglio.Vucciria, where the old port of La Cala is located, and Il Capo, are north of Quatro Canti. La Vucciria Market, situated near Piazza San Domenico, is one of the city\''s most thrilling open-air markets, and a true joy to walk through. It\''s a place of boisterous color and endless side streets where fishmongers guard over the day\''s catch, and hawkers yell prices behind crates of local produce and fruit. The Museo Archeologico Regionale \"Antonino Salinas\" (Regional Archeological Museum Antonino Salinas) houses Phoenician and ancient Greek art. Il Capo, just west of Vucciria, is also home to an eponymous market, perhaps Palermo\''s largest. Like much of Palermo, the neighborhood is a maze of alleyways and miniature streets. The Teatro Massimo (Massimo Theater), the largest neoclassical opera house in Italy where the closing scenes of <em>The Godfather: Part III</em> were filmed, dominates the neighborhood. The oldest of the four neighborhoods, Albergheria is west of Kalsa, bordered by via Maqueda on the east, Corso Tukory to the south, and the Palazzo dei Normani (Palace of the Normans) and Villa Bonanno to the north and north east. The Palazzo dei Normani stands on the highest point of Palermo\''s ancient center, and was the seat of the Kings of Sicily during the region\''s Norman domination. Today, it\''s the seat of Sicily\''s regional parliament, and the Astronomical Observatory of Palermo. Visitors can tour the palace royal apartments, and King Roger\''s royal bedroom.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Zisa</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the western edge of central Palermo, Zona Zisa is home to the palace of the same name, the spectacular Castello della Zisa, one of the city\''s treasured Arab-Norman architectural marvels. \"Zisa\" comes from the Arabic term \"al-Azīz,\" meaning roughly \"the splendid\" or \"the gorgeous.\" The castle is a restored Moorish Palace designed entirely in Islamic-style architecture, with an ingenious air conditioning system. The palace fell into disrepair in the decades after the Second World War, but was rebuilt according to its original design. Nearby, north of Via Cappuccini, lies the Catacombe dei Cappuccini (Capuchin Catacombs), a tourist attraction and burial ground not meant for the fainthearted.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mondello</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">More or less a suburb of Palermo proper, Mondello is a coveted seaside resort area with a beach lying between Mount Gallo and Mount Pellegrino. Goethe in his <em>Italian Journey</em> described the area as, \"the most beautiful promontory in the world.\" The long, white-sand beach is lined with pastel-colored changing cabins. It\''s a half-hour bus ride from the center of Palermo, and close to the Riserva Naturale di Capo Gallo (Natural Reserve of Capo Gallo), which has beautiful places to swim and snorkel along its shore. The Charleston, a striking Art Noveau building on a pier along the beach, houses Alle Terraze, an elegant restaurant with excellent views and good seafood. Although the beach can be very crowded during the summer, Mondello is miraculously desolate from time to time, and a respite from the commotion of the rest of Palermo.   &nbsp;</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

The must-see museum houses one of the most remarkable collections of paintings and sculptures in the world, including two legendary works: the <em>Venus de Milo</em> and the <em>Mona Lisa</em>. Another popular museum is the Musée d\''orsay, which brings in roughly 2.5 million visitors each year to admire its comprehensive collection of Impressionist masterpieces. Next there is the Centre Georges Pompidou, also known as the Beaubourg, whose avant-garde architecture has been compared to a multicolored steamboat launched in the belly of Paris.

Famous antiques galleries are gathered around Haussman Boulevard and Matignon Avenue, down the road from famous auction house Christie\''s.

Performances here include the world-famous operas and ballets, like Berlioz\''s <em>Romeo & Juliet</em> and Tchaikovsky\''s <em>Swan Lake</em>. Its ultra-modern counterpart, Opéra Bastille, concentrates more on music than dance performances and hosts great operas as well as symphonic concerts. Two other concert halls will enchant classical music connoisseurs, namely Salle Pleyel, which is home to the Paris Symphonic Orchestra, and Salle Gaveau, which is dedicated to chamber music.For jazz lovers, there many clubs are located in the Saint-Michel and Saint-Germain-des-Prés districts. To start, be sure to check out great sounds at the Caveau de la Huchette in the 5th arrondissement. Otherwise, the legendary Olympia Hall still welcomes the biggest names in French pop, just as it did when Jacques Brel and Edith Piaf pulled in the crowds. World-renowned bands and singers also fill up the Zénith and AccorHotels Arena.

The big complexes like the UGC Ciné Cité Les Halles and UGC Ciné Cité Bercy show more than 15 films at once, mostly in their original languages. The MK2 chain, which not only screens blockbusters but also independent French movies, also has a faithful clientele. Worth noting is that the MK2 Parnasse and MK2 Beaubourg have a more avant-garde selection than the other theaters belonging to the chain. Elsewhere, in the Latin Quarter, art and experimental cinemas carry on the French cinematic tradition of showing classic films. For true cinephiles, try the Studio Galande, which often puts on high quality film series and retrospectives.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports Venues</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many international tournaments take place in Paris. The Stade de France is the traditional venue for major events as it can accommodate up to 80,000 people.

Typically, bars close at either 2a or 4a whereas clubs close at 6a. Some are open extra late on weekends. Vibrant neighborhoods include Bastille, Rue de Lappe, Rue de Charonne, and Rue de la Roquette, where you will find countless bars. These range from fancy wine bars to smaller local cafés, but all of them boast a distinctly Parisian ambience. Arguably the most popular nightlife district in recent years can found between République and Oberkampf.Rue d\''oberkampf offers lively Café Charbon, whose infectious energy is brought by both locals and tourists. Alongside the Saint-Martin Canal, Chez Prune is practically a Parisian institution. The 5th arrondissement is also very lively, particularly among students who flock to the pubs behind the Panthéon, between Place Descartes and Rue Mouffetard. The  Hurling Pub is a great hangout with its infused vodkas and wooden counter. Also worth trying are central Bombardier, an authentic English pub, and the more upscale bars found in Saint Germain des Prés and alongside the Champs-Élysées.Paris also has a flourishing club culture, boasting DJs in action all through the night. The hippest DJs play at Queen on the Champs-Élysées. Disco nights at Queen are very popular, particularly among house music fans. For a less glamorous and more trendy experience, try underground techno temple Rex Club. After hours, follow the hip crowd for experimental techno and French electronic music at Batofar, a red boat moored on the Seine. Another option is Glazart, a boon for creative types where all kinds of arts and music are intertwined for live performances and crazy nights.For salsa and hip hop, head to Barrio Latino in the Bastille district or to Favela Chic near République metro.

Alternately, if you\''re looking for the most upscale, exclusive clubs, you stick to the 8th arrondissement. Visitors to the capital can also take advantage of the cabaret culture and traditional French Cancan shows at the Moulin Rouge or enjoy some high-class cabaret at the world-renowned Crazy Horse.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parks and Gardens</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nature lovers will there find public parks and gardens around almost every corner in Paris. A stroll in the Tuileries Garden is one of the best ways to round out your visit to the Louvre, and visitors to the Latin Quarter breathe easy at the famously stunning Luxembourg Garden.If you\''re with kids, try the Jardin des Plantes, where you\''ll also find a zoo and tropical botanic garden, the Parc Astérix theme park, or the Thoiry zoo for wildlife. The largest park in Paris, Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, is another great spot for families as it contains numerous children\''s playgrounds. Younger locals also enjoy picnicking and partying here, and visitors of all ages can enjoy the vistas of the city from the top of the park\''s tower. Of course, no Parisian entertainment guide would be complete without mention of its number one attraction for family fun: Disneyland Paris. Situated just east of Paris, the massive theme park has visitors from all of the world flocking to France, earning it the reputation of the most-visited theme park in Europe.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Some even call it Silicon Sentier.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">3rd Arrondissement</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Together with the 4th arrondissement, the 3rd arrondissement of Paris comprises Le Marais, a historic neighborhood tracing back to the Middle Ages.

Visitors to the 3rd arrondissement will also find the oldest known house in Paris situated on the rue de Montmorency, where it has stood since 1407. Although it is generally less popular among tourists than its bustling counterpart, the 3rd arrondissement is an integral part of Le Marais and an area absolutely worth touring.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">4th Arrondissement</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The other half of the beloved Marais district, the 4th arrondissement is sometimes called the \"arrondissement de l\''hôtel-de-Ville\" because it has long housed Paris\''s town hall.

Beyond its myriad trendy shopping and nightlife establishments, not to mention its longstanding reputation as the premier LGBTQ haven in Paris, the 4th arrondissement is home to such iconic landmarks as the Notre Dame de Paris, Centre Georges Pompidou, and Place des Vosges, a beautiful old square lined with historic buildings.

To soak up the scenery of the 10th arrondissement, follow the tree-lined canal from Rue du Temple to Place de Stalingrad and take in the many charming bridges and barges.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">11th Arrondissement</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Formerly a haven for furniture craftsmen, the Bastille district now plays host to the city\''s young and trendy crowd. The central Rue du Faubourg Saint-Antoine has seen countless restaurants and nightlife venues spring up in recent years, and the nearby Rues de Lappe and Oberkampf are particularly noteworthy in the way of after-dark entertainment.

In particular, museum lovers will enjoy the arrondissement\''s quaint Edith Piaf Museum and specialty Museum of Smoking.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">12th Arrondissement</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Home to one of the largest public parks in Paris, the Bois de Vincennes, and the second largest opera house in the city, the Opera Bastille, this sprawling arrondissement is both lovely and laidback. You\''ll find lots of quiet and residential streets interspersed with select historic attractions like the Place de la Bastille and Gare de Lyon train station.

Although a secondary Chinatown has sprung up in the 20th arrondissement, you\''ll find renowned Asian eateries and emporiums here, notably some of the best dim sum around. The national library, known locally as the Bibliotheque Nationale de France, has also taken up residence in the area facing the Quai de la Gare on the Seine.

Opposite the park is the Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris, which offers housing for international students in the city and boasts architectural styles for all of the world. Before you make your way out of the 14th arrondissement, be sure to stop by the iconic Lion of Belfort sculpture at the heart of the Place Denfert-Rochereau.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">15th Arrondissement</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This district on the Left Bank of the Seine houses more people than any other district in Paris. It plays host to delightful Parc Andre-Citroen, which takes its name from the famous car manufacturer and spans 14 hectares (35 acres) in total. Farther north is a collection of skyscrapers overlooking the river and the replica Statue of Liberty found on the Île aux Cygnes. In fact, the 15th arrondissement boasts the tallest skyscraper in the city, the Tour Montparnasse, lending to its metropolitan ambience. Although it sees fewer visitors than some of the more central districts in Paris, this area offers a nice blend of things to do and places to escape.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">16th Arrondissement</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There\''s no denying this is among the most fashionable and cosmopolitan districts in Paris. The 16th arrondissement strikes a near-perfect balance of trendy restaurants, cultural draws like museums and embassies, grand residences, and nature escapes.

Continue your tour of the colorful 18th arrondissement by following the Rue des Abbesses, which is lined with trendy boutiques and eateries, drawing a hipper crowd. Then tour the renowned Pigalle area, formerly the Parisian red light district, for nightlife fun at famous cabarets and bars.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">19th Arrondissement</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Both the Canal Saint-Denis and Canal de l\''ourcq run through this relatively quiet district, which also offers visitors the third and fifth largest public parks in Paris, called Parc de la Villette and Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, respectively. Pack a picnic or opt to stroll around 19th arrondissement and take in sights like the Conservatoire de Paris and the Cité des Sciences et de l\''industrie museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">20th Arrondissement</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most well-known cemetery in Paris, the Cimetière du Père-Lachaise, sits in the 20th and final arrondissement of Paris. It is the final resting place of countless artists and famous figures, both French stars like Edith Piaf and international celebrities like Jim Morrison, not to mention one of the most-visited sites in the city. This district is also home to the eclectic Belleville neighborhood whose Chinatown competes with that of the 13th arrondissement. While the young, artsy crowds tend to be drawn further east of the city, this area has managed to hold on to its working class origins and welcoming spirit, creating a vibrant and diverse district well worth exploring.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

For soccer, always cheer for the Perth Glory whilst for cricket the Western Warriors are the local favorites. The Wildcats basketball team also have a huge local following. Car fanatics and speed demons will find heaven at Barbagallo Raceway while horse-racing fans can get their fix at Gloucester Park. For those who enjoy a bet, Burswood Casino has more than 140 gaming tables.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you like to dance, there are no shortage of clubs in Perth, ranging from alternative to house and rave. For gay friendly clubs, Northbridge is the place to go. Connections is particularly noteworthy with top-tier DJs and a great dance environment.There is no particular style to pubs and bars throughout the city, rather a cross-section of contemporary and Australian themes. A bonus for the after-dark scene is Perth is the city\''s outdoor lifestyle and Mediterranean climate, meaning most drinking establishments have a garden bar. Northbridge, Subiaco, and Fremantle tend to be the trendiest drinking hotspots. The Brass Monkey\''s down-to-earth style makes it a popular pub with a maze of bars to enjoy. The Universal Bar has a more designer feel and attracts trendsetting locals out to let their hair down and boogie the night away. Since the late 1990s, there has also been a revival of Irish pubs in Perth. Try Durty Nelly\''s or The Bog in Northbridge. There are also some excellent old-style pubs worth visiting in the outer areas, including the historical Rose and Crown in Guildford, the Kalamunda Hotel and the Mundaring Weir Hotel in the hills.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Concerts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city\''s live music scene has flourished in recent years. You will find pubs with a variety of concerts, including most Irish pubs. The Queens Tavern and the Newport in Fremantle have great live music. Another well established band venue is the Metropolis, offering a combination of DJs and live music. The Fly By Night is an excellent alternative live gig spot in Fremantle, and Clancy\''s is another favorite among musicians. Those in the mood for a symphonic experience, check the program at the Perth Concert Hall. For the ultimate outdoor musical experience, the Leeuwin Estate Concert Series concerts are the most sought after tickets on the music calendar. Music festivals offer another option, most introducing local and visiting musicians. The Perth Festival and Festival Fremantle are the two most well known. However, look out for South Perth\''s summer concerts, Totally Huge, the Pride Festival and Spring in the Valley. Kings Park has a summer music series, as does Araluen, both superb settings to enjoy a bottle of wine, a picnic and soulful sounds. Fremantle Arts Centre also has a wonderful Sunday afternoon courtyard music series.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Events</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Perth comes alive with events throughout the year that will keep you entertained. The Burswood Dome hosts a string of expos and international entertainers, while the Entertainment Centre is the prime venue for blockbuster shows. For a more intimate setting, The Playhouse, Subiaco Arts Centre and Deckchair present theatrical performances. His Majesty\''s Theatre is the home of opera, ballet, and musicals, and the Quarry Amphitheatre is a delightful outdoor venue.  For a fun family day out head to the hills for the Mundaring Festival and the Zig Zag fair. Closer to the city, on the shores of the Swan River, the Claisebrook Carnival is another option. The two biggest crowd-pleasers are the Lotto Skyworks and the Christmas Pageant. If you like a good laugh head to Hillarys Boat Harbour for the annual milk carton regatta. Other districts that host festivals include Rottnest, Joondalup, Mandurah and South Perth. The Buskers Festival in Fremantle is a wonderful street affair.

 (1566,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Central Business District (CBD)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It is easy to navigate your way through the grid-like streets of Perth\''s central business district. A walk along St George\''s Terrace is a walk on the windy side. Situated at the western end of the city, with Adelaide Terrace at the eastern end, the district\''s high-rise buildings create a notorious wind tunnel effect along this stretch of road. Nearby Barracks Archway, located at the very top end of St George\''s Terrace, is all that remains of the city\''s original military barracks, which were built by convict labor in 1863 and demolished in 1966. This district also houses the city\''s shopping epicenters, the Hay and Murray Street malls, and the many arcades that join the two together. Forrest Place is known as the city\''s \"town square\" and bordered on four sides by the Myer department store, Wellington Street, the Central Post Office Building, and the Murray Street Mall. This area is often the site for free public entertainment and street theatre. Buskers are a regular featured, and the overpass from the Myer department store to the Carillion Arcade offers a prime viewing spot. Across from Forrest Place is the Wellington Street Rail Station, the main terminal for the metropolitan train system. Within the Hay Street Mall lies the entrance to London Court, a shopping arcade built in the style of Tudor England. Knights joust every hour as the entrance clock chimes. King Street, at the western end of the city, has seen a revamp that has transformed the once run-down warehouses into funky shops and apartments. His Majesty\''s Theatre is located here. This Edwardian theatre, built in 1904, is now home to the Western Australia Ballet and Opera companies. Heading east along St. George\''s Terrace, you will find the Gothic style Saint George\''s Cathedral and Government House, home of the Governor of Western Australia. Next door to the Government House is the Perth Concert Hall, which is the main venue for classical music performances. The Perth Mint in Hay Street is Australia\''s oldest operating mint. Established in 1899, the mint now specializes in producing gold, silver and platinum coins, and houses a museum with regularly changing displays. The Old Perth Port and Barrack Street Jetty is the base for Perth\''s ferry and river cruises. It is also the home to a number of restaurants and cafes. Terrific panoramic views of the city and Swan River can be seen from Kings Park, a 405-hectare (1,000-acre) area of native bushland adjacent to the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Northbridge</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Over the rail line from the city lies Perth\''s nightlife centre. Every Friday and Saturday night, the streets of Northbridge overflow with people on their way to nightclubs after eating out at one of the many nearby restaurants. A combination of Italian, Greek, and Asian influences make for a wide variety of food and a cosmopolitan party atmosphere. As well as being the capital of the city\''s nightlife, Northbridge is also the place to take in some culture. The Art Gallery of Western Australia, the Perth Institute of Contemporary Art (PICA), and the State Library are all held here. On weekends, you can also browse through the open-air market held in the square outside the art gallery.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fremantle</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although strictly speaking a suburb of Perth, Fremantle has its own unique style, and the locals consider the suburb separate from the rest of Perth. A major working port and fishing city, the town\''s history dates back to convict times. The National Trust has classified most of Fremantle\''s buildings. A major restoration occurred on many of these historical buildings when Perth hosted the Australian defense of the America\''s Cup yacht race in 1987. Fremantle\''s culture has a dynamic multicultural influence. A visit is a gourmet dream, as the cafes and restaurants that line the streets offer an international feast of dining experiences. Sipping a cappuccino at an outdoor cafe as you enjoy a spot of people watching on South Terrace is practically compulsory. Do not miss the Fremantle Markets at the corner of South Terrace and Henderson Streets. The original markets opened in 1897, and they still flourish today with more than 150 stalls selling fruit and vegetables, clothing, antiques, and other assorted knick-knacks. Fremantle Prison is another must see. Ex-prison guards conduct guided tours of the heritage-listed prison. The eerie night tours take you through the prison and gallows by candlelight for a truly fantastic experience. A trip to Fremantle is not complete without a visit to Fremantle Fishing Boat Harbour and a meal of fish and chips at one of the many venues like Kailis\'' Fish Market Cafe.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Swan Valley</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Swan Valley, a 30-minute drive from the center of Perth, plays host to an excellent selection of wineries, restaurants, galleries, and accommodation options. The Valley hosts two festivals each year: Taste of the Valley, held during April, and Spring in the Valley, held annually on the second weekend in October. Both showcase the region\''s finest food, wine, and art. The region, one of the first areas settled within Western Australia, has a history of producing award-winning wines. Two of the state\''s largest wineries, Houghton Wines and Sandalford Wines, are located in the Swan Valley, along with many small boutique wineries.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rottnest Island</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rottnest Island is Perth\''s own holiday resort and home to the famous quokka, a small wallaby unique to this area. The island is a great place for a day trip. It is reminiscent of bygone days—playing hide-and-seek in small coves, cycling across rolling hills and stopping for ice cream in a hidden local store.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

All of the pieces here are instantly recognizable from reproductions, but only a small number have ever traveled, and then only recently. The Philadelphia Museum of Art and its small companion, the Rodin Museum, represent a brief history of world art on the Ben Franklin Parkway: Ancient Egypt, Impressionism, Expressionism, Cubism and Post-Modernism comes with guided tours and souvenir reproductions available in the gift shop. The Penn Museum has an excellent collection of archaeological and anthropological artifacts including a massive Egyptian sphinx, while the National Liberty Museum offers an inspiring look at those who have shaped the history of nations.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Historical Sites</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Because of the city\''s rich history, there are plenty of historic sites that are innovative in the way they educate and entertain at the same time. One of the most famous Philly landmarks is the Liberty Bell, the bell from the Pennsylvania Statehouse commissioned by William Penn in 1751. Another key piece of American history found in this fair city is Independence Hall, the birthplace of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. For some literary history, the Edgar Allan Poe House, where the famous poet penned \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" and \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" among other masterpieces. Another famous residence, Franklin Court, was once the home of Benjamin Franklin, and now houses seven different museums chronicling different aspects of this historic American\''s life and contributions to the world.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Every possible sound is available in Philadelphia on Wednesday through Saturday nights. On other nights, the choices are narrower, but if you look carefully there\''s always something going on. Philadelphia has always been a popular stop for national acts. There are concert halls that range from the massive stadiums of the Susquehanna Bank Center to the comfortably mid-size Trocadero, Tower, Electric Factory or Keswick, right down to the overheated and cramped rooms of the legendary bars where everyone from Bruce Springsteen to the Roots paid their dues. There is a string of clubs along Delaware Avenue on piers jutting into the Delaware River and more around South Street. It is possible to find a string quartet, opera or symphony performance every night of the week. With the Curtis Institute and the various college programs, the quality of street performers brightens the parks and sidewalks in the spring. The Philadelphia Orchestra is legendary for conductors like Leopold Stokowski, Eugene Ormandy, Ricardo Muti and Sir Simon Rattle.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater & Dance</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For nearly a hundred years, Philadelphia was mainly known as a \"tryout\" town. New York producers would try out material here before opening on Broadway. These days it\''s more likely a play will originate here. The Walnut Street Theatre has produced the American premieres of two Tom Stoppard plays that were hits on London\''s West End, but have never played New York. InterAct Theatre Company hosts a new play reading every January which supplies work to regional theaters across the country. Keep an eye out for anything by Brat Productions, a young edgy company that often stages strong works in a bar. The first ten days of September, the Philadelphia Fringe Festival takes over the Old City district with a mix of local acts and visiting troupes from the Edinburgh, Toronto and New York. There are still national touring companies that perform big Broadway musicals at the Forrest, maintaining a healthy balance of new and recognized work. From the Pennsylvania Ballet to The Philadelphia Dance Company (known as Philadanco), the dance performance scene here is low profile, but substantial. The city often acts as a lab for companies that are seen and celebrated in New York or Washington. Once again, because of the numerous collegiate dance programs, there are always visiting professional and resident performers to see.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Children</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Philadelphia pays particular attention to its younger visitors. The National Park Service provides tours and multimedia, interactive, educational displays at Independence Hall. At the Please Touch Museum, children are encouraged to put their mitts on everything and the entire museum is scaled to kids. There are similar setups in the Academy of Natural Sciences and the Franklin Institute. Don\''t forget the popular petting pen at the Philadelphia Zoo. Many of the larger chain bookstores around town have Saturday programs for children with readings and performances. The Free Library often has scheduled activities, including readings, films and performers. Then there are the children\''s theater programs at the Arden and Annenberg. To make your travels more convenient, children under the age of 12 years ride for free on SEPTA\''s buses and subways on Saturdays.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From hipster hangouts in the University District to jazz in the Northern Liberties, Philadelphia\''s after-dark scene is diverse.

This is where the Liberty Bell rang out and where the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the Bill of Rights were written and signed. Sit under a tree in the gardens and mail postcards home from Benjamin Franklin\''s Post Office (besides everything else, he was the first Postmaster General). This area is Society Hill, where you can tour Independence National Park, then do some shopping and have a cocktail at an intimate bar; then head up the block to a play, concert, or movie; discuss the show over a late dinner and head out again to hear live music, all within a few blocks.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Old City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">North of Market Street is Old City, which is Philadelphia\''s version of New York\''s Soho, with wonderful restaurants like Chlöe and Cuba Libre, small art galleries like Gallery Joe, and a growing number of theaters and performance spaces like Painted Bride; this is the fashionable young hip scene in all its shades. Much of the activity in this region is concentrated around 2nd Street. The three-decade-old Arden Theatre is located here and is a great place to catch a performance. End the evening with a drink and a bite to eat at the ever-popular Continental, an Old City staple.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Penn\''s Landing</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">East of the Old City, along the Delaware River, Penn\''s Landing is a backdrop for outdoor festivals and free summer concerts, as well as fireworks on holidays. You can also take a ferry across the river to the aquarium. In the summer, open-air clubs north of the Ben Franklin Bridge (such as Dave and Busters or the River Deck) take advantage of the breathtaking view.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chinatown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">West of Old City, between 8th and 13th Streets, is Chinatown. These days Chinatown is about half Chinese and half a combination of Vietnamese, Thai, Japanese, Burmese and Pan-Asian, and rivals any Chinatown in the country. It\''s also home to the Pennsylvania Convention Center and the Reading Terminal Market. Start your exploration at the brightly hued Friendship Gate as you stroll around this eclectic neighborhood of interesting shops, Asian restaurants, and a plethora of cultural festivals.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rittenhouse Square</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the west end of Center City is the fashionable Rittenhouse Square district, where you can buy great clothing and then wear it to dinner at the restaurant next door (possibly Monk\''s Cafe or Alma De Cuba). Lovers of the offbeat might venture into the Mütter Museum, a veritable cavalcade of creepy medical mysteries. For a bit of people-watching, there\''s no place better than the Ritterhouse Square Park, for which the district is named. It\''s here that you\''ll find people of all ages and walks of life enjoying the sunshine, lounging, playing with their pets or enjoying the many festivals that are hosted here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Avenue of the Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Broad Street, south of City Hall, is the Avenue of the Arts. The orchestra, the ballet and the Wilma, Gershman, and Prince theaters all reside here, interspersed with great restaurants and jazz clubs. Modeled on Parisian boulevards, the Ben Franklin Parkway presents a wonderful, tree-lined walk past Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, several expensive hotels, the main Library and several museums. At the end of the Parkway, atop a hill, is the Philadelphia Museum of Art.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Philly and Bella Vista</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is where rich Italian history and new communities of Vietnamese and Thai are just the tips of the iceberg when it comes to great dining. Cantina El Caballito brings the spice, and the old Italian Market has got a little something for everyone. The main avenues of Ninth Street and Washington Avenue are a great place to experience Philadelphia\''s international flavor.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">West Philly</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Across the Schuykill River in University City, the University of Pennsylvania and six other major schools are the centerpieces of a deep blend of students, immigrants and old neighborhoods. Take in some art at the Institute of Contemporary Art and then dine at the White Dog Cafe. Other highlights include the Penn Museum, a leading museum of archaeology and anthropology at the <span>University of Pennsylvania. Head on over to Distrito for Mexican small plates and potent margaritas in a lively space. </span>Powelton Village with its Victorian homes and leaf-lined avenues is a lovely retreat from the city center. This historic district is home to a creative set that\''s highlighted in institutions like the Philadanco dance company and the <span>Tiberino Museum.Spruce Hill extends from South Market Street to Woodland Avenue and this multicultural neighborhood is home to The Rotunda, a community arts space that has a variety of interesting exhibitions. The historical homes lend the neighborhood a distinct character.</span></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Northern Liberties</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">North of Old City, this is the \"new frontier\" of the hip scene. Once an industrial and manufacturing district, Northern Liberties has gone the way of many similar neighborhoods, witnessing something of a renaissance in the recent years. NoLib, as it\''s locally known, is a vibrant hub of stand-alone boutiques, bars, pubs and entertainment venues. The Standard Tap will take care of your eating-and-drinking needs, and Johnny Brenda\''s will keep you entertained into the wee hours with its packed concert calendar. For dancing, head for the Barbary. After that, Silk City Diner at 5th and Spring Garden is the place to go for a grilled cheese sandwich at 4a on a Sunday morning or the best <em>huevos rancheros</em> for breakfast.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

However, the state does have a particular fondness for sports and the Phoenix metro area offers a varied cornucopia of exciting attractions and sports venues. While downtown, the focal point is the lively and quaint Copper Square. This area encompasses a one-square-mile (1.6-square-kilometers) of entertainment with venues such as Talking Stick Resort Arena, which showcases the Phoenix Suns. Chase Field offers Arizona Diamondback games and features a retractable roof to protect from the debilitating summer heat. If you seek the cool greens of one of Phoenix\''s many world-class golf courses like the elegant Tournament Players Club of Scottsdale or Troon North, then you must take out your clubs. For an adrenaline rush, hop in a car and drive the fastest one-mile oval in the world at the Phoenix International Raceway. Visitors can also take in the great Arizona outdoors with a scenic hike up Echo Canyon Trail on majestic Camelback Mountain. Further east in the Superstition Mountains, you can take an excursion to Goldfield Ghost Town where you can try to unravel the secrets of the Lost Dutchman\''s Mine. Visit ancient Indian cliff dwellings at the five-story pueblo, Montezuma\''s Castle further outside of town or saddle up for a real cowboy experience at Trail Horse Adventures and hit the trail on horseback. If your idea of the Wild West requires a gunfight, hitch your pony at Rawhide Western Town where Roughriders still tote six-shooters and settle differences with a fast draw.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums & Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There is a varied art and cultural scene in Phoenix, which results in an eclectic mishmash. The internationally acclaimed Heard Museum showcases the heritage and art of the Southwest\''s various Native American tribes. For a more participatory view of the city\''s early days, visit the Pioneer Arizona Living History Museum, a 90-acre (36-hectare) pioneer town where costumed interpreters recreate life in the Arizona Territory of the mid-1800s.For more contemporary art, visit the Phoenix Art Museum, where modernity is the focus and artwork from a variety of eras are displayed in an interesting building.

In Scottsdale, the  McCormick-Stillman Railroad Park is a fun choice for the whole family and features interactive exhibits, a museum, and rail rides on vintage trains.

If you can\''t make it to the track, try the off-track betting and great beer at Padre Murphy\''s.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If shopping is more your style, Phoenix can accommodate that as well since there are so many strip malls. Downtown at the Arizona Center, you will find dining, dancing, and some shopping. However, most fashionistas will find themselves at the Biltmore Fashion Park which features world-class shopping at Neiman Marcus and Gucci. For more affordable style, shop at the upscale Scottsdale Fashion Square or seek forgotten treasures in the gargantuan Brass Armadillo.

 (1586,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown Phoenix</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The downtown area has changed dramatically since the tired days of the 1970s and 1980\''s. With the construction of the Talking Stick Resort Arena for Phoenix Suns basketball and Chase Field for the MLB\''s Arizona Diamondbacks, these two teams have brought life to downtown. If you\''d rather attend a symphony or seek something a little more upscale, you can visit the nearby Arizona Center or CityScape, both located in the neighborhood known as Copper Square. The square has several coffeehouses, restaurants and bars that bring people downtown for a drink or a bite before the show.Phoenix is also trying to revitalize the urban center with more residential living and amenities which serve the people who live here. Two great restaurants found here are Pizzeria Bianco by the locally adopted son, Chris Bianco or Durant\''s down Central Avenue. for those who seek more tradition.Incorporating the themes of Phoenix\''s early history with culture and local events, Copper Square is a one-square-mile (1.6-square-kilometer) hotspot for activities and action.

For concerts and fairs, the Ak-Chin Pavilion offers an open-air amphitheater all year, even in the summer!  The growing west side continues to spread outward into other communities such as Buckeye and Surprise, however, the town with the most charm would be Glendale. Most visitors go to Historic Downtown Glendale and its neighborhood Catlin Court for first-rate antique shopping opportunities. The Arrowhead Towne Center Mall offers newer wares and different dining choices. The University of Phoenix Stadium, home-turf of the Arizona Cardinals is located here. Drop by for a game, soak in the electrifying energy and take part in a typical tailgating party!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Phoenix</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Largely comprised of low-cost housing and shared lots with the farming industry, the area of South Phoenix has somewhat of a reputation for violence and poverty. However, the upscale community of Ahwatukee is a notable exception. Ahwatukee residents are mostly older adults and urban professionals who commute around the city for work, and as such, there are not too many attractions here.This area is mostly residential, with upscale apartments that coexist with middle-class housing. For some of the best views of Phoenix, be sure to take the South Mountain Park Scenic Drive while you are here. Fabulous sunsets are the pride of Arizona and best enjoyed from a desert wilderness vantage point. If the traveler prefers more shopping, it can be found at the Arizona Mills Mall near the outlaw little township of Guadalupe.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North & Northwest Phoenix</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Further north, visitors can find the tranquil towns of Cave Creek and Anthem.

For some of the best pizza in the city, visit Pomo Pizzeria, a genuine <em>pizzaiolo </em>made in the old tradition of Napoli.Located south of Scottsdale, Tempe is primarily a college town and the home of Arizona State University. There is plenty to see and do in Tempe, from sports to recreation. For water activity, visit the Tempe Town Lake or climb Hayden Butte, while for entertainment, this suburb is the spot for local festivals such as Fall Festival of the Arts. The University is located in the center, ringed in by family and student housing. Continuing east we find Mesa, Chandler and Gilbert. All residential communities that are primarily filled with families and strip-malls.

Prague\''s main theater is the National Theatre, built in the late 19th Century. Opera and ballet are performed here as well.For centuries the Czechs have been renowned for their ingenuity and originality, which again is reflected in the number of specialized theater groups and theatrical displays which are around. Perhaps the most famous of these are the Black Light Theatre, the National Marionette Theatre and the Image Theatre as well as the magic lantern shows at the Nova Scena (an extension to the National). It must be said that some of these productions are blatantly aimed at the tourist market but nevertheless they provide an insight into the traditions of Czech mime and puppet theater. There are several theaters, some with productions in English, that put on plays by the most famous of playwrights from Shakespeare to Vaclav Havel — the former Czech President. Even if a play is in Czech, several theaters now have translation facilities available - but it is wise to check prior to booking.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the Stavovske Divaldo (Theatre of the Estates) and the Statni Opera Praha (State Opera House) you can catch opera and ballet performances. There are regular classical concerts and recitals held in a variety of venues from the National Museum and Smetana Hall (Smetanova Sín) of the Municipal House, to the Dvorak Hall of the Rudolfinum and the halls of the Liechtenstein Palace. Churches also play a prominent role in bringing music to the people, with frequent recitals at lunchtime and in the evenings. The Prague Spring Music Festival commences around May 12 (the anniversary of Smetana\''s death) each year and lasts for some three weeks, attracting top artists from all over the world.The Czechs have a reputation for a love of jazz, and there are several excellent jazz clubs in the area. The most famous but perhaps not the best is the Reduta on Narodni where Presidents Havel and Clinton once performed. It is advisable to book ahead, particularly if a popular musician is playing. During the summer months, a number of jazz bands can be found strolling the city\''s streets and squares, particularly around Charles Bridge and Old Town Square.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Steeped in history and culture, Prague\''s world-class museums are home to some of the most riveting exhibits in Europe, and an absolute delight to tour. From the Kafka Museum that traces the life, history and brilliance of the native eminent writer, to the ingenious exhibits at the various buildings of the National Museum, Prague has a lot to offer. The Prague Jewish Museum hearkens back to its early Jewish heritage, some exhibits also honoring and detailing the history of the traumatic Holocaust. Other smaller, yet quirky museums in the city include the Sex Machines Museum and the Museum of Communism.  As much as Prague loves its history, it also reserves a special place for arts in its culture-soaked sprawl, with an impressive warren of contemporary and modern art galleries dotting its streets. Start your artistic adventure at the Prague National Gallery, where the largest collection of art in the nation awaits you. Later, explore more avant-garde exhibitions at the FUTURA Center and the Hunt Kastner Gallery.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Czech film industry is thriving, with many Western films now being shot in the Czech Republic. There are also a huge number of cinemas (<em>kino</em>) at which all types of films are shown. Most western films are shown in Czech with English subtitles. Kino Svetozor, located in the heart of the city showcases everything from mainstream and arthouse cinema, to rare and underrated Czech movies, whereas the Ponrepo-Bio Konvikt screens riveting world movies in its beautiful, historic movie hall. Other indie cinema houses in the city include Bio Oko, Kino Aero and Kino Mat.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Prague has a vibrant nightlife with many clubs and dance halls both in its center and in the suburbs. It has now become a regular spot on the pop/rock concert circuit, with most major artists having performed in Prague at one time or another. The area around Wenceslas Square is the hub of club entertainment including places like the extremely popular Lucerna on Vodickova</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">.</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\''re in Prague for a night, don\''t leave without experiencing the acoustic marvel of the Cross Club, a longstanding music venue that specializes in an array of musical genres.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Casinos</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Over the last few years there has been an increase in the number of casinos in Prague, although the visitor must be wary that some casinos can also mean arcades containing one-armed bandits, especially in the center of Prague. For a casino in the true sense of the word, where one can play roulette and card games, try your luck at venues like the Casino Atrium Hilton and the Ambassador.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1643,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North & Western Suburbs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is mainly an area of residential buildings and parkland, containing Prague\''s largest park — Stromovka. The park was originally a hunting ground and is now home to many attractions including the Vystaviste Exhibition Grounds, the Prumyslovy Palace, the Planetarium and the Lapidarium. A walk to the west of the park brings the visitor to the Royal Summer Palace (Letohrádek královny Anny), a neo-Gothic building where the National Museum stores some of its treasures. To the south of Stromovka lies Letna Park and beyond that is a plateau overlooking the main city and river. Here, you will see the large Metronome that replaced the monument to Stalin - one of the largest in the world, which was destroyed on the orders of Krushchev in 1962. Other places of interest are the National Technical Museum and the National Gallery Collection of Modern & Contemporary Art. Walks through the residential areas will expose you to many styles of architecture here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hradcany</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Originally part of four independent boroughs, Hradcany, also known as the \''castle District\'' is one of the most picturesque neighborhoods in the city. Situated on the hill overlooking Prague, Hradcany is made up of Prague Castle, St Vitus Cathedral and the Strahov Monastery - all places that are steeped in history. The Army Museum, the Royal Gardens and the Toy Museum are also nearby. St Vitus\'' Cathedral was commissioned by Charles IV (1316-1378) and its foundation was laid in 1344. However, work on it went on for nearly 600 years before being finalized in 1929, which means that the architecture is from many different periods and in different styles. Attractions inside include the crown jewels, the crypt and the South Tower. The Strahov Monastery was founded in 1140 by the Premonstratensian Order, although its present day baroque appearance dates from the late-17th and 18th Centuries.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mala Strana</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Covering the area just below Hradcany and bordering the river, Mala Strana is just across Charles Bridge from the main city. Now home to many foreign embassies occupying a number of buildings built by the Catholic nobility, the area is full of palaces, gardens and baroque churches including the Church of St. Nicholas (Sv. Mikulas). Open daily, this is an example of Prague baroque architecture; it was built between 1702 and 1753 by Christoph Dientzenhofer and later also worked on by his son. Frequent concerts and recitals (both at lunchtime and in the evenings) are held here featuring the works of Mozart.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Josefov</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The birthplace of acclaimed novelist Franz Kafka, Prague\''s Jewish Quarter can be reached by a short walk from Wenceslas Square or by taking the metro to Staromestska, Line A. Dating back to at least the 13th Century, this area is rich in history. Places to visit include the Jewish Cemetery, its five synagogues; the Jewish State Museum; and the Jewish Ceremonial Hall with its Hebrew clock dating from the 15th Century. The narrow cobbled streets lend a unique atmosphere to the area, especially at night. The Kafka Museum is located on the border of Josefov and Stare Mesto.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Stare Mesto</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Prague\''s Old Town is centered around Old Town Square, the Jan Hus Monument and the Old Town Clock Tower featuring its astronomical clock dating back to the 15th Century. The Old Town Hall is open daily. It is only a short walk away from Wenceslas Square. There are several churches of note here including the Church of Our Lady Before Tyn as well as courtyards and numerous cafés, bars and restaurants catering to every taste.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nove Mesto</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is Prague\''s main commercial and business district. It is based around Wenceslas Square at the top of which is the National Museum and the two main commercial streets—Na Prikope and Narodni. Running from these streets are many smaller streets and courtyards. There are hotels, bars and restaurants abound in this area. Walking along Legerova or Ke Karlovu (where you will find the Dvorak Museum) will bring you to the Police Museum from where you can take a walk along the top of the Botic Valley towards the river.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Vysehrad & the Eastern Suburbs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Centered upon the ancient rocky fortress of Vysehrad (the Republic\''s most-revered landmark) and containing the Vysehrad Cemetery, a Romanesque rotunda and the Gothic church of St. Peter and Paul, this area stretches to the working-class suburb of Zizkov. It is home to the TV Tower (from which you can enjoy panoramic views of Prague) and the ancient Zizkov Hill, atop which stands a statue of Jan Zizka (a 15th-century army general). The mausoleum in which the remains of the three Communist presidents of the Republic and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier can be found is also located here. The suburb of Vinohrady contains Prague\''s most modern church, the Church of the Most Sacred Heart of Our Lord (Kostel Nejsvetejšího srdce Páne), which was built in 1928.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Virtually everywhere you turn there\''s a beach vendor renting everything from boogie boards and water bikes to jet-skis and wind surfing equipment. Thrill seekers might want to try their luck parasailing. The view from aloft is a spectacular panorama of the city and the miles and miles of surrounding coastline and jungle terrain. Each local beach is unique in its own right and seems to serve a different purpose. Playa Los Muertos is a centrally-located, lively restaurant and vendor-strewn hot spot, regardless of its ominous-sounding name. To the north there is Punta de Mita, which has beautiful white coral beaches, making it extremely popular among sunbathers. Playa Anclote, nestled within a small cove, is perfect for swimming and surfing. Playa Pontoque offers visitors crystal clear waters, making it perfect for snorkeling. To the south (and accessible only by boat) are three beaches worth making the trip to: Playa Las Animas, another cove protected, white-sand beach popular with swimmers and sunbathers and those with small children; Quimixto another beach perfect for snorkelers; and, Vallarta\''s southernmost beach, Playa Yelapa, located in the well-known, once hippie-inhabited town of Yelapa. Hop aboard the 116-foot Alegre Cruise ship for a day of fun in the sun or a romantic sunset cruise. Ecological cruises have become increasingly popular in these waters and elsewhere, while humpback whale-watching is a favorite as well. Those with a thirst for adventure may want to try their luck aboard the pirate ship Marigalante, a day-long, round-trip voyage that\''s guaranteed to make you dream of pieces o\'' eight.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Puerto Vallarta\''s rich art culture dates back centuries to the Aztec culture and much of the artwork you\''ll find here—from the pottery of its indigenous peoples to gleaming streamline modern sculptures—is steeped in historical significance. One gallery not to be missed is the Galería de Ollas, which is devoted to exhibiting and selling the works of art created by the areas finest Mata Ortiz potters. More contemporary works can be seen at the Manuel Lepe Museum Gallery, which showcases the work of the area\''s most renowned artist. Lepe\''s colorful works of art (dating back to the 60s) allow you to see a more natural side of Puerto Vallarta, a side that only Lepe has been able to bring to life. The Galeria Pacifico is a great starting point for novice art enthusiasts, offering an eclectic array of paintings and sculptures by up and coming local artists.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In Puerto Vallarta, many of the bargains to be had here come directly to you as you relax on the beach. Locals, hawking their wares, offer a wide variety of souvenirs, necessities and local folk art to visitors as they relax in the shade of a <em>palapa</em>—be sure to haggle over the prices, it\''s expected. For those who simply must get a little browsing in while on vacation, be sure to stop by the municipal market in the Rio Cuale area. Everything from the mandatory souvenir T-shirt to fine silver jewelry is available there. If you get hungry while shopping up a storm, check out the food market upstairs; it serves some of the best traditional Mexican dishes around. Once fortified, you\''ll be ready to do the town. Indoor shopping avenues around town include Plaza Caracol, Galerias Vallarta and Los Mercados. Peyote People in El Centro offers a wide range of Mexican handicrafts and souvenirs.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Puerto Vallarta\''s nightlife used to be pretty tame, but within the last couple of years there has been a surge in the dance party scene. Take the Malecón, for example. This area used to be filled with shops and restaurants, but not anymore. Nowadays it\''s the place to come dance \''til dawn. From the infectious energy of the El Solar bar that sits right on the Playa de los Muertos beach, to bringing in the weekend with Mexican locals and live music at La Ingrata, there is no dearth of nighttime entertainment in Puerto Vallarta. If your idea of chilling in this seaside town involves kicking back with cocktails or beers, then places like Bar Morelos, Bar La Playa and Los Muertos Brewing are right up your alley.

The Violons du Roy, a famous string orchestra, performs regularly in local churches. The Salle Albert-Rousseau, located in Sainte-Foy, is the choice of many artists who wish to perform in a smaller state-of-the-art theater. Finally, artists who wish to perform under the stars can do so at the Agora du Vieux-Port, a popular outdoor theater.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals and Carnivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">During the summer, Quebec City becomes one giant theater. Artists perform in the streets, in parks, and pretty much everywhere a crowd can gather. In June, hundreds of children from several countries come to the Montmorency Historic Site, near the famous Montmorency Falls, to share their cultures through dance and music. In July, the Summer Festival brings local and international artists to town. For 10 days, stages spring up everywhere in the city: Place d\''youville becomes its own performance space, a large stage is put together in front of the Parliament Buildings and most city parks are turned into small theaters where jazz, folk, pop, rock, opera and every other imaginable genre resonates. For less than CAD10, you can purchase a pin that gives access to all shows during the festival.In August, Quebec City goes back in time with the Fêtes de la Nouvelle-France, which celebrates the 150 years of French Regime in the 17th and 18th centuries. During the last week of the summer, Quebec City has its annual fair with all the rides, animals, clowns and cotton candy one would expect.During the winter, Québécois find a way to entertain themselves despite the cold, at their famous Winter Carnival. For more than 47 years, they have enjoyed many sporting, artistic and cultural activities during this magical carnival, which allows them to rediscover each year the wonders of winter. An international ice sculpture contest, a parade, an ice castle and a canoe race on the icy St. Lawrence River are some of the activities that take place during these 17 days and nights of sheer fun. Ice rinks also spring up everywhere—at Place d\''youville, for instance, people of all ages skate to classical music.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although Quebec City offers tons of outdoors activities, those who prefer to stay inside won\''t be disappointed. There are plenty of museums, malls and movie theaters. The Museum of Civilization is a must: it features many exhibitions on topics as varied as the beginnings of civilization, the history of clothes, naval history and humor. The Musée du Québec, meanwhile, is a treasure of fine art. It has held exhibitions with some of Canada\''s most famous artists, including Krieghoff and Dallaire, as well as world-renowned artists like Rodin and Tissot.Those interested in Quebec\''s history will enjoy the Musée des Augustines de l\''hôtel-Dieu de Québec, which relates the history of the sisters who founded the first hospital in North America, as well as the Musée de l\''amérique française and the Musée du Fort, which focus more on military history. The Battlefields National Park has an interesting interpretation center, with a multimedia show on the battle of the Plains of Abraham.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Old City is filled with shops and boutiques, but there are many great malls in the Greater Quebec City area. Les Galeries de la Capitale is often the favorite because of its indoor entertainment park with rides, an ice rink and movie and IMAX theaters. Place Laurier is the largest mall with 350 stores, while Place Sainte-Foy has many upscale stores and designer boutiques.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many visitors take at least a day to swoop down the slopes or hit the links at Mont Saint-Anne or Stoneham, both just minutes east of the city. For those who prefer to watch their sports, the area\''s several hockey teams are not to be missed. The Remparts play in the Quebec junior league, while the Citadelles are the Montreal Canadiens\'' minor league affiliate in the American Hockey League. Both offer outstanding value and fast-paced entertainment.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At night, the Grande-Allée is the place to be. This is Quebec City\''s busiest street, filled with restaurants, cigar rooms, cafés, pubs and nightclubs. Chez Maurice is one of the most popular clubs in the city, along with Chez Dagobert. As a general rule there are no cover charges to get into nightclubs, which means that people can go club-hopping all night long.In the end, a walk in the Old City, especially on the Dufferin Terrace promises some the best entertainment available in Quebec City. The view is absolutely gorgeous. Wander through the streets, watch a clown draw a smile on people\''s faces, enjoy the afternoon in a nice café or dance the night away.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1671,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Old Quebec</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Old City is one of the most popular areas for both tourists and locals, not only because of its charm but also because of its many restaurants, pubs, hotels and boutiques. St-Jean Street is the main entrance to the Old City. This street is at the heart of the social and cultural life of the city, with Place d\''youville and the Palais Montcalm Theatre on the south side, and the Le Capitole hotel on the north. During the summer months, Place d\''youville is a stage for performing artists, and once the weather gets cold, people of all ages ice skate here to classical music.  A little further down is the historic St-Jean Gate, where one can find many small shops, boutiques, pubs and restaurants. The Magasin Général L.P. Blouin, an old-time general store specializing in souvenirs and collectibles, is a popular stop. Restaurants and pubs abound, but the Pub Saint-Alexandre and the Au Petit Coin Breton are among the best.  City Hall is on Côte-de-la-Fabrique is where the strip of restaurants and boutiques continues. This street leads to the Place de l\''hôtel-de-Ville, the Petit Séminaire de Québec and the Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-Québec. The Rue du Trésor, where local artists show and sell their works, is a few steps away and leads to the Château Frontenac and the Dufferin Terrace boardwalk. A stroll on the boardwalk is a must, for the splendid views of the St Lawrence River, the Laurentian Mountains and the Île d\''orléans. The boardwalk also features street entertainers in the summer and two great ice slides in the winter.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Place Royale and Vieux-Port</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Terrace ends with long stairs on both sides: one set goes down to the Vieux-Port and Place Royale, the most picturesque area of Quebec, built in 1608 and abounding in restaurants, antique shops, art galleries and boutiques. Place Royale is not as busy as the Old City but just as fascinating. The wonderful Laurie-Raphaël, Café du Monde and L\''inox bar are located in the Vieux-Port area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Plains of Abraham</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The other set of stairs goes up to the Plains of Abraham. It can be quite a workout on a hot summer day but the view is worth the effort. The Plains of Abraham are at the heart of Quebec City\''s history. Although nowadays it looks more like a beautiful place to have a family picnic, it is the site of a bloody 1759 battle between the French and the English. Several plaques describe the battle and explain its significance to Quebec\''s history. The Martello Towers, which were built to counter the British invaders, are strategically located on the Plains and are open to the public.  On the east end of the Plains, the Musée du Québec is home to an interpretive center about the battlefields, and also hosts numerous art exhibits throughout the year. The Plains are a rendezvous for joggers, rollerbladers, soccer players in the summer and cross-country skiers and tobogganers in the winter. This is also where people gather for the annual St-Jean-Baptiste celebrations, the Summer Festival and the Winter Carnival.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">St-Louis Street and the Grande Allée</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">St-Louis Street runs parallel to St-Jean Street and is equally filled with restaurants and boutiques. Aux Anciens Canadiens is an interesting restaurant for those with a taste for traditional Quebec cuisine. In this 17th century house, the wait staff dresses as the first inhabitants of the colony did, and customers can enjoy some of Quebec\''s classics—<em>tourtière</em>, for example.  Further west is the entrance to the Citadel, a protective fort located on Cap-aux-Diamants. Every day in the summer, troops perform the changing of the guard according to pure military tradition, and The Citadel also has a fascinating museum. The Parliament Buildings are located on the corner of St-Louis Street and Dufferin Avenue, across from the Plains of Abraham. The design is quite interesting, as the architect, Eugène-Étienne Taché, was inspired by the Louvre Museum in Paris. The results are splendid French Renaissance buildings, which are open for the public to discover.  St-Louis Street becomes the Grande-Allée west of the Parliament Buildings. The Grande-Allée is synonymous with entertainment. This is where most of the clubs in the city are located, and there are also plenty of restaurants. In summer, the establishments open their terraces and people go from one club to the other, dancing the night away.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">René-Lévesque Boulevard and Cartier Street</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Parallel to the Grande-Allée but further south is René-Lévesque Boulevard. A few blocks West is Cartier Street, another popular entertainment and dining district. With restaurants like Graffiti, Café Krieghoff and Momento, this area is a haven for great dining.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Suburbs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are many suburbs around Quebec, and most of them are much more than bedroom communities. In the West end, Sainte-Foy has several great restaurants and shopping malls.On the St Lawrence River, Beauport\''s picturesque Royale Avenue leads to the Montmorency Falls. The majestic Île d\''orléans, an island in the middle of the St. Lawrence River with orchards, farms, charming inns and traditional cuisine, is like having the country in the city. The great outdoors is just a short drive from the Old City—that\''s the beauty of Quebec. From fascinating historic buildings to amazing dining and entertainment, powerful rivers and breathtaking mountains and forests, you can have it all.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The splendor of the city\''s natural setting, combined with its attractive squares, parks and monuments as well as the warmth of its people, makes it a unique and unforgettable place. Founded in 1534 with a mere 204 inhabitants, Quito is now the bustling capital of Ecuador, with nearly two million people. For 360 years, its boundaries were marked by the Cerro del Panecillo in the south, Plaza de San Blas in the north, Volcán Pichincha in the west, and Plaza de la Marín in the east. Today the city is much larger, and has been growing since the early 20th Century. In 1980, La Mariscal tourist area was developed between Patria, Colón, Amazonas and 6 de Diciembre Avenues. In 1978, Quito was declared a World Heritage site due to its extraordinary historic center. Quito offers marvelous views anywhere you stand. The majestic snow-capped mountains that surround it—Pichincha, Cotopaxi, Ilinza and others—stand proud like grandiose guardians of time. The bells from the old churches resound throughout the city center, awakening the suburbs in the north, south and nearby valleys.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The city is also widely recognized for its penchant for stunning Ecuadorian art and artists, which are duly manifested in its premier art galleries, museums and exhibitions. One important gallery of modern art is the Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana on Avenida 6 de Diciembre and Patria, which exhibits works by Ecuadorian artists. On weekends, at the nearby Feria de Exposiciones Artesanales del Parque El Ejido, you will find a wide variety of Ecuadorian handicrafts. The Museo de San Agustín, located in the Convento de San Agustin, features many works by artists from the Quito school of painting, with mostly religious themes. The Museo de Arte Colonial displays, as the name implies, art from Quito\''s colonial period, while the Museo Guayasamín pays tribute to Ecuadorian artist Oswaldo Guayasam, featuring art from many of the artist\''s different periods. Another well known Ecuadorian artist is memorialized in the Posada de las Artes Kingman, featuring four rooms of contemporary Ecuadorian art, as well as a permanent collection of Kingman\''s own work.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Historic Sites and Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the border of the historical center, you can visit La Iglesia del Belén, a very old church which has an image of Christ by Caspicara, important sculptor and painter of the colonial period. In front of this is the El Churo de la Alameda, a spiral-shaped construction from the beginning of the 20th Century, which was one of the main viewpoints in the city. The Convento y Museo de Santo Domingo dates back to the 16th Century and features Plateresque and Mudejar styles, along with a collection of paintings from the Dominican Order. Another historic site dating from the 16th Century is the Museo de la Ciudad, the former Hospital de la Misericordia, which features exhibits about the history and day to day life of Quito. The Plaza de la Independencia is the point around which the city of Quito was planned in 1535 and is surrounded by many historically significant buildings, namely the Palacio de Gobierno, the Iglesia de la Catedral, and the Palacio Arzobispal. Just a little ways outside the city is the Mitad del Mundo (middle of the world), where you can visit the monument marking the site of the equator.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To enjoy Quito\''s nighttime entertainment, you might begin with a movie. Multicines del CCI is a modern eight auditorium complex featuring the latest releases, and located in the north of the city. Also located in the north of the city is the Cinemark 7, showing all the latest and most popular releases. For less mainstream films, movies at the Casa de la Cultura Ecuatoriana periodically hosts film festivals and art house films.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Quito hosts an interesting nightlife that is largely concentrated around the area of La Mariscal, where an array of bars and clubs dot the streets.

For fun in the sun, head towards the Guayllabamba Valley, where the beautiful city Zoo is located, with species from all over Ecuador. You will see, for instance, a variety of birds from the coast, the mountains and the east, as well as the anteojo bear from the Andes, and the condor, the symbol of Ecuador. Returning from any of these diversions, go to the Parque de La Carolina, in the north of the city, which has a playground, boats and bike tracks. Parque El Ejido is located at the midpoint of the city and features such facilities as a volleyball court and on the weekends, the park is transformed into an arts and crafts market.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Finding local gems and handicraft items is easy in Quito, where corners are adorned with small Andean markets and homespun shops. When you\''re here, leave behind the dazzle of big brands and opt instead for indigenous items that may include everything from intricate pottery and trinkets, to alpaca knitwear and art. If you\''re an avid shopper looking out for a good bargain, venture out a bit further into the Andean Highlands and stop at Otavalo\''s famous Ecuadorian market, where you are bound to find a souvenir for your home or a gift for your loved one. Closer to the city, the Mercado Artesanal La Mariscal is a wonderful open-air market that urges you to be chaff authentic local items from tourist junk.

Most theaters offer a range of plays and productions, but there is one special exception; Teatro Sistina is the undisputed home of musicals. There are numerous private, experimental and avant-garde theaters often hosting young artists and offering stimulating, thought-provoking works. The Abraxa Teatro, is home to an innovative company who seek to express themselves and their ideas by using their bodies rather than speech. If your tastes are a little more traditional, historic theaters such as Teatro Argentina, one of the oldest in the city, the Teatro Nazionale offers operas and performances by famous actors and theater companies. The Teatro della Cometa and the Teatro Flaiano offer drama, comedy and other performing arts.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Live Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are a large number of venues in Rome offering live music by international artists from all over the world.

If you enjoy jazz music, the municipal Casa del Jazz and Alexanderplatz jazz club in Trionfale are recommended. More successful live venues and clubs are concentrated in certain areas such as the Testaccio quarter, including places like Akab and Radio Londra. Classical music lovers will be pleased with Rome\''s varied concert season.

Il Tempietto also offers concerts throughout the year.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rome is one of the most historic cities in the world, and the birthplace of many famous artists and artistic styles, so it should be no surprise that some of the finest museums in the world can be found in the Eternal City. One of the most incredible collections of art, from paintings to sculpture, as well as Michelangelo\''s masterpiece ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, can be found in the Vatican Museums\'' hundreds of rooms. View works of masters like Caravaggio, Bernini and Raphael at the opulent Galleria Borghese. Many consider the Capitoline Museums to be the oldest public museum in the world, and today its collection includes ancient Roman statues and Renaissance art. Not everything in Rome is ancient, however. At the National Gallery of Modern Art, visitors can admire works by Van Gogh, Jackson Pollock and many modern Italian artists. Maxxi displays even more recent art, being focused on works created in the 21st Century.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Monuments & Landmarks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Housing centuries of history and culture in its many spectacular sights, Rome is an easy city to enjoy on foot, and visitors will discover monuments and landmarks around almost every corner. Some of the most obvious attractions in the Eternal City are the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Roman Forum, and Pantheon. With easy access to Vatican City, you can also uncover such wonders as the Sistine Chapel, Vatican Museums, and St. Peter\''s Basilica. Fans of the ancient world will have more than enough to keep them busy by touring the various ruins found in Rome.

 (1720,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Old Rome & Colosseo</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When most people think of Rome, the first thing that comes to mind is the ancient empire and the remains of that era. The historic center of Old Rome only takes up a small amount of this now modern city, but the whole area should not be missed by visitors to the Eternal City. Undoubtedly the most iconic symbol of ancient Rome is the huge Colosseum, once the city\''s main source of public entertainment. Just next to the Colosseum is the ancient center of daily life, the Roman Forum. It was here that the main marketplace was located, as well as main government buildings. Today the remains provide a breathtaking addition to a trip into Rome\''s past, with ancient foundations standing alongside triumphant arches. Sitting right next to these sites is the Palatine Hill, with the Domus Augusti (Augustus\'' house) and Palace of Domitian looking down on the forum from the hilltop. Legend has it that this hill is the location that the eventual founder of the city, Romulus, and his brother Remus, were nursed by a she-wolf as infants.  Another of Rome\''s original hills is also located within Old Rome- the Capitoline Hill. On top of this hill, visitors will find the world-famous Capitoline Museums, largely designed by Michelangelo. These archaeological museums\'' collections are made up of a mind-blowing number of relics of Rome\''s vast empire, from ancient Greek statues to Egyptian sarcophagi, ancient coins and more. A bit farther away from this concentrated ancient center is the grand Pantheon. Once a temple, then a church, today this landmark with its Corinthian columns and coffered dome is one of the most visited in the city. Just steps away is the Piazza Navona, lined with charming restaurants and hosting street performers almost any day of the week. Also close by is the ever popular Campo de\'' Fiori, home to a lively daily produce market that has been going strong since 1869.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Modern Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rome\''s Modern Center is situated just northeast of Old Rome and the area around the Colosseum, and on the western edge of Termini Station. This whole area is always bustling, with plenty of nightlife, shopping and accommodations to go around. One of the area\''s grandest attractions is the Palazzo Barberini, formerly the stately home of Pope Urban VIII. Today the palazzo houses the Galleria Nazionale d\''arte Antica, with its collection of fine arts by Renaissance masters. Across the street, sitting on top of ancient Rome\''s highest hill, is the monumental Quirinal Palace, one of Italy\''s three official presidential residences. Just around the corner is the beautiful Baroque Trevi Fountain- make sure you toss in a coin over your left shoulder to ensure that you will return to Rome one day! Also located in the Modern Center are the National Roman Museum, in the historic Baths of Diocletian.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Vatican City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Across the Tiber River from the historic center of Rome sits a tiny (44 hectare/110 acre) country and the center of the Catholic faith worldwide, Vatican City. This small nation consists of the extensive Vatican Museums, which contains some of the most priceless treasures in the world, the sprawling Saint Peter\''s Square and Basilica, the famously decorated Sistine Chapel, and the Apostolic Palace, among other official church buildings. Visitors to Vatican City enjoy buying postcards and special stamps from the gift shops and sending them out from the smallest country in the world. A large portion of Vatican City is actually made up of gardens, parkland and semi-private structures, some of which can be visited with prior arrangement. Although not actually in Vatican City, the round Castel Sant\''angelo has historically been a residence of Popes and is actually connected to Saint Peter\''s Basilica by a private passage called the Passetto di Borgo.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rome\''s North Center is one of Rome\''s larger districts. The Piazza di Spagna\''s iconic Spanish Steps, with the Trinità dei Monti church at the top are some of the most popular sites in the area. Practically next door to the piazza is the Villa Medici, once home to the Medici family and now the French Academy in Rome. The villa\''s gardens practically fuse with the larger Borghese Gardens, attached to the Galleria Borghese, which displays works by Raphael, Caravaggio, Rubens, Titian and others. On the other end of the gardens from the museum is the ever popular Piazza del Popolo with its towering Egyptian obelisk. Just down the Via di Ripetta is the Mausoleum of Augustus, an ancient tomb that once held the remains of the Imperial Family.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Trastevere</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the west bank of the Tiber is the hip and trendy district of Trastevere. The main thoroughfare between Trastevere and Old Rome is the Ponte Garibaldi, a popular spot for selfies. Perhaps due to its two universities Trastevere is always lively, with a large number of bars and restaurants throughout its cobblestone streets. The Santa Maria in Trastevere church in the Piazza di Santa Maria is one of the oldest in the city and contains stunning 13th-century gold mosaics. This district is also where you will find the Orto Botanico di Roma botanical garden, with over 3,000 species of flora in its various themed gardens and sections. The Tempietto tomb in Trastevere\''s San Pietro in Montorio church is said to mark the spot where Saint Peter himself was martyred, though this is disputed.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Aventino-Testaccio</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Aventino is named for the Aventine Hill, one of Rome\''s original seven, located just the other side of the Circus Maximus from the Colosseum. The top of the hill is adorned with the Parco Savello, next to the Santa Sabina Basilica, which provides incredible views of domes and rooftops of the city, with an especially great view of Saint Peter\''s Basilica. At Santa Maria in Cosmedin, stick your hand in the Bocca della Veritá (Mouth of Truth), but make sure you don\''t tell a lie or legend says it will bite your hand off. The Terme di Caracalla is also located in this area, a large public bath during the Roman Empire. Today these ruins host several cultural events a year, including operas in the summer. The adjoining area of Testaccio is known for nightlife, being the home to many nightclubs and traditional restaurants.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Esquilino-San Giovanni</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just south of Termini and the Modern Center, sandwiched between Ancient Rome and Nomentano is Esquilino (another of the original seven hills) and the area of San Giovanni. This is a less touristy area of Rome, but still has a number of interesting sights to see. Perhaps the most prominent landmark of Esquilino is the 9th-century Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica, with its gleaming golden mosaics. San Giovanni is named for the San Giovanni in Laterano Basilica, which is the oldest Papal Basilica in Rome and the Roman Catholic mother church. The basilica contains the tombs of six former popes as well as the Scala Santa, the staircase which Jesus is said to have walked during his Passion, which were moved from Jerusalem to Rome in the late 16th Century. The basilica is a major pilgrimage site for Roman Catholics. At the Piazza di Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, visit the collection of the National Museum of Musical Instruments, which displays portions at a time of its collection of thousands of instruments.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nomentano</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just east of Termini and the center, and outside the ancient walls, is the fairly large district of Nomentano, which encompasses the smaller area of San Lorenzo. This is a great area for people who still want to be close to the action of Rome, but also want somewhere more removed to escape to when it\''s time to retire for the evening. The area is largely residential, so it\''s a great place to mix with the locals and get some authentic Roman flavor. Nomentano is also home to the church of Sant\''agnese fuori le mura, which houses the remains of Saint Agnes, as well as to the Villa Torlonia and its gardens, once home to Mussolini. San Lorenzo is a trendy area, and very popular for nightlife, from lively sidewalk restaurants to pubs and hipster bars.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outskirts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rome extends outside the city proper, with outskirts stretching in practically all directions. To the southeast of central Rome, close to the airport, is the neighborhood of Ostia, known fondly as the \"Roman Riviera\" due to its shoreline. Ostia is Rome\''s tourist port, as well as the main beach. Another interesting destination in Ostia is the ancient city of Ostia Antica. Often overshadowed by the ruins of Pompeii, Ostia Antica was a major port of the Roman Empire under Claudius and Trajan. After its desertion, the town was covered with sand and mud from the river, preserving it much like Pompeii was preserved by the ashes of Vesuvius.  To the southeast is the Via Appia, or Appian Way, the famous ancient Roman road used by the military to go between Rome and southeastern Italy. The road is lined with historic attractions, including several tombs and catacombs, churches and archaeological sites like the Villa dei Quintili, the Circus of Maxentius and Caffarella Park. The area also has some museums like the Rome Planetarium, and San Paolo fuori le Mura. A popular day trip involves biking down the Via Appia to stop at all the incredible sites around the way. To the north of central Rome and Vatican City are many of the city\''s suburban areas. One of this area\''s biggest landmarks is Monte Mario, the biggest hill in Rome, although not one of the original seven. The vast views from Monte Mario are a true sight to be seen. On the northwestern shore of the Tiber is the Foro Italico and Stadio Olimpico, the centerpiece of Rome\''s 1960 Summer Olympic Games. Today the complex and stadium still host events, from major soccer matches and tournaments to big name concerts like Elton John, U2, Madonna, The Rolling Stones and many more.  Rome is so steeped in history and culture it would be almost impossible to experience everything the city has to offer, but with so much to be seen, it\''s certainly fun to try!</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

There are buildings fitting that description clustered in downtown, but the heart of California\''s capital city has tree-shaded streets lined with elegant Victorian homes. Unlike most major metropolitan areas that grew from a civic center, Sacramento started from several small communities that grew together. Today, within the sprawling metropolis, the influence of these original settlements can be seen throughout the city. Just a few minutes southeast of Sacramento International Airport along Interstate 5, Sacramento visitors are rewarded with sweeping views of the river meandering down to the Delta. Sacramento\''s tiny settlement grew explosively with the discovery of gold. Disappointed gold-seekers returned from the gold fields and founded the surrounding towns. Today, the Sacramento region extends west from Davis and Woodland to the lovingly preserved frontier town of Auburn, northeast along Interstate 80, and to vacation spots in the Sacramento River Delta.

Today, Old Sacramento is a 12-block restored neighborhood between the river and Interstate 5 and is a state historic district with interesting old stone and brick buildings. There is a world-class comedy club, a live theater, elegant restaurants with sweeping views of the river, candy stores, costume shops, pubs and bookstores to be found along the canopied plank sidewalks. The focal point of downtown is the Downtown Commons, reached from Old Sacramento through a pedestrian tunnel covered with colorful murals. This open-air mall (cooled with suspended \"misters\" during the summer) features a megaplex movie theater, department stores, a bookstore, specialty clothing stores and much more. Commons shoppers are entertained by strolling musicians, jugglers, acrobats and mimes. The California State Capitol and Museum and Crocker Art Museum are other downtown landmarks worth mentioning.

From the Hope Gallery on Main Street that boasts of a wonderful personal art collection, to the 15th Street Gallery\''s astonishing collection consisting of award-winning artists and their artworks, Salt Lake City has a broad art palette.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The biggest ticket in town is basketball, and for those who love the game, Salt Lake City has a double bonus. The Vivint Smart Home Arena in downtown is the home ground of the basketball\''s Utah Jazz team. Less than three miles east, the Huntsman Center is home to the University of Utah Utes. Smith\''s Ballpark is one of the most inviting baseball parks in the country, home to the Salt Lake Bees.   Salt Lake City is also lined from top to bottom with golf courses that are competitive and diverse. The surrounding natural beauty makes the courses works of art in their own right.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoors</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With nearly a dozen ski resorts within an hour of downtown, you are never far from the swish. If you want to stay near the city, try Alta Ski Area, Brighton Ski Resort, Snowbird Ski and Summer Resort or Solitude Mountain Resort. If a smaller town setting is what you desire, Park City lies minutes east of Salt Lake, nestled in a gorgeous mountain valley. Park City is home to world-class resorts such as the The Canyons, Deer Valley Resort, Park City Mountain Resort and Sundance Ski Area. Whether your interest lies in downhill, cross-country, night skiing, snowboarding, sledding, snowshoeing or any other snow sport, you will find it here. Even the greatest snow on earth is only here for six months a year. When you put the skis and sleds away, break out the hiking boots, picnic baskets and rock climbing gear. The numerous canyons that surround the Salt Lake valley are filled with hiking trails without number. There are five National Parks just a few hours south of Salt Lake. If you enjoy red rock vistas, enormous canyons, rock arches, bluffs, petrified sand dunes, towering plateaus or just plain breathtaking scenery, do not miss the national parks that lie beyond the city limits.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Water & Amusement Parks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are a few places to enjoy the water as well, although surfboards will have to be traded for floating tubes, the sand for mats and the beach for a water park. Seven Peaks Waterpark Salt Lake City has much to offer. Fifteen minutes north of downtown Salt Lake, perched on the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains, you will find Lagoon, Utah\''s only amusement park, and a thrill seeker\''s delight. It boasts several thrill-seeking opportunities including an old wooden roller screamer and Colossus, a high-speed coaster with a double loop. Other intense rides include \"The Rocket\" a 217-foot tower that pushes you to the top and then lets you free fall back to the ground.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">July 24th is a state holiday in Utah that celebrates Pioneer Day. The day is set aside to remember the first colonists that set their sights on the West. It is the day to remember the overwhelming feat of wrestling a desert valley atop the mountains into a prosperous city and state. The festivities officially begin in the morning with one of the largest parades in the country, and continue until nighttime when several locations offer Independence Day-style firework displays. Travelers to the state are welcome to join the celebration, although it is wise to make plans and reservations early as hotels fill up fast. Be warned that outer and inner-city travel is a mess the morning of the parade. Other prominent festivals include the world-renowned Sundance Film Festival, the Utah Arts Festival and the Craft Lake DIY Festival.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The stately Temple Square is flanked by high-rise office buildings. Brigham Young\''s Beehive House creates a 19th-century oasis across the street from office towers of the 21st century. Arranged on a logical grid pattern with Temple Square at its center, all addresses in the city can conveniently be found with little effort.  Business and tourism are the lifeblood of the city, but between the office buildings lay the cultural and entertainment centers that present numerous diversions at the end of the business or ski day. The Capitol Theatre, home of Ballet West, is both an architectural and cultural gem. One of downtown\''s classic older buildings, the theater has been renovated into a modern venue for Broadway productions and intimate concerts. It is only a pleasant stroll from any of the downtown hotels and is close to some of the city\''s finest restaurants. Equally accessible from anywhere in downtown is Abravanel Hall (home of the Utah Opera Company) and the Vivint Smart Home Arena. The volunteer hosts at the Salt Lake City Convention and Visitors\'' Bureau in the Salt Palace Convention Center can always recommend a variety of activities, favorite restaurants or sites to visit.  Capitol Hill in Salt Lake City is truly a hill! A walk from downtown up State Street to the Utah State Capitol Building offers a sampling of the grandeur of the homes of mining and financial barons. Several of these old residences provide a good sense of Salt Lake City as it was at the turn of the 19th century. The private homes on the hill also offer an eclectic blend of Victorian, Italianate and \"wealthy pioneer\" architectural styles. Just to the west of the Utah State Capitol is the Pioneer Memorial Museum, which also provides a sense of life in the \"Beehive State\" in its early days.  Central City, another significant downtown hub is dominated by Trolley Square, located not far away from the leafy locality surrounding Liberty Park. Once the home of the trolleys that were the transportation mainstay of Salt Lake City, the trolley barns of Trolley Square now enclose some of the best restaurants and shopping in the city. Including the local favorite Desert Edge Brewery at the Pub, the numerous dining establishments are each a pleasure. Shopping ranges from the eclectic to the stylish and from the mainstream to the uncommon. Trolley Square is an ideal setting for an afternoon of shopping or an evening of dinner, drinks and a movie. The Leonardo, an eminent art museum, and the Tracy Aviary, an eight-acre (3.23 hectare) attraction spread out over Liberty Park are also located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The University of Utah</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The university district and the university itself offer a number of delights. On the campus of the University of Utah are the Utah Museum of Natural History and the Utah Museum of Fine Arts. Kingsbury Hall is a concert and performance venue that is a special pleasure for jazz performances, dance productions and theater. The University\''s Huntsman Center hosts the sporting exhibitions of the University of Utah Utes, while the nearby Red Butte Gardens is a four-season experience that, once again, integrates the city with Utah\''s diverse natural environment.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sugar House</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sugar House, one of the city\''s oldest neighborhoods finely balances the charm of its regional essence with the constant waves of urbane trends. Adding to this newfound urbanity is the vibrant student-life that surrounds Westminster College. A stunning neighborhood in appearance as it is in spirit, Sugar House\''s main attraction is the verdant eponymous park that is sprawled across the landscape, with the Wasatch Mountains in the backdrop. At its periphery is a lovely sprinkling of dining establishments, boutiques, art galleries and gastropubs to keep the young entertained.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">9th & 9th</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Located east of Liberty Park, the 9th and 9th neighborhood is a compact area that underwent a vibrant revival in the summer of 2007. Since then, it has flourished as an offbeat avenue in the city for avid shoppers, and also hosts an array of street murals, kinetic sculpture art displays and other sidewalk attractions. A number of trendy boutiques and coffee shops are spread out around the intersection of 900 East and 900 West.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outside the City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Like many metropolitan areas, Salt Lake City has sprawled past its designated boundaries into numerous suburbs and outlying areas. North of the city center lie Farmington, Hill Air Force Base and Ogden, home to the Hill Aerospace Museum, Eccles Dinosaur Park and Lagoon Amusement Park. West of the city center is home to Salt Lake International Airport and much of the area\''s rapidly expanding industry. To the east of the city lies the magnificent Wasatch Front. These craggy peaks and bucolic valleys shelter Park City and world-renowned ski resorts such as Deer Valley Resort, Park City Mountain Resort and Snowbird Ski and Summer Resort.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Felsenreitschule theater serves as a venue for the annual Salzburg Festival.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If it rains, you could use the weather as an excuse to visit world-class museums such as the Haus der Natur, a huge natural history museum, or the Carolino Augusteum, which concentrates on local history and culture. Modern art can be found at the Museum der Moderne, and photography lovers are advised to visit the pertaining Rupertinum. Adults and children alike will enjoy the city\''s colorful and interactive Toy Museum, which is housed on the premises of the Bürgerspital. Hangar 7 features a collection of interesting vehicles, from old airplanes to Formula 1 cars.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Salzburg is a city with a close connection to the world of classical music; the Salzburg Festival, held every summer, is world-famous. There are events throughout the year in the Great Festival Hall, and in autumn, there is the Salzburger Jazzherbst, when smooth jazz accompanies the changing weather. The Great Hall of the Altes Mozarteum is another big venue. If you would like to hear Mozart\''s music in his hometown, you could visit the Mozart Audio-Visual Collection for historic recordings of the master\''s work. The Rockhouse is the place to head for rock, pop and jazz concerts on an almost daily basis. If you are interested in jazz, don\''t miss the Jazzit, a venue where you can get in on the local jazz scene. If you like pub gigs, then go to the Shamrock Irish Pub, a popular Irish pub near the Staatsbrücke. Big-name concerts are staged at the Salzburgarena.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Historic Attractions</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Salzburg is dripping with history, from making its mark on classical music to the mighty Austro-Hungarian Empire, there is no shortage of historic attractions to immerse yourself in. Don\''t miss out on a visit to Mozart\''s birth house, where you can see original furnishings and even the master\''s own violin! It\''s impossible to miss the Hohensalzburg Fortress towering over the city\''s Old Town as it is one of the largest in the country. Visitors can explore the ample halls, courtyards and chambers that make up this medieval castle. The opulent Mirabell Palace is located on the east side of the river. Classic film fans may recognize the palace\''s beautifully manicured gardens from <em>The Sound of Music</em>. Kids and kids at heart will love the trick fountains in Hellbrunn Palace\''s gardens.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1767,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Altstadt (Old Town)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1997, Salzburg\''s Altstadt (Old Town) was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the category of cultural monuments worth preserving for future generations. This should speak for itself, and the Altstadt should be on every visitor\''s \"to-do\" list. Because the city center is not very big, you should be able to find your way around fairly easily. Classic Salzburg is a feast for the eyes, with impressive buildings dating back to the baroque period dominating the scenery. Different epochs can easily be distinguished from one another, with Italian baroque features standing side-by-side with examples of Austrian individualism. The Salzach River acts as a natural border to the Old Town, and the traffic-ridden Rudolfskai stretches out alongside it. Another natural feature that encloses the Old Town is the Mönchsberg, a big rock face that used to protect the city\''s treasures from unwanted guests during the Middle Ages.  Salzburg\''s cathedral is without a doubt the main attraction in the Altstadt. It is flanked by two squares, the Residenzplatz and the Kapitelplatz, both used for concerts and open-air events. The nearby Residenz, the Neue Residenz, the Franciscan Church and the Kollegienkirche are only a stone\''s throw away from each other. Towering above all these attractions is the Hohensalzburg Fortress on the Mönchsberg.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Getreidegasse</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the western part of the Old Town, you can admire the Kollegienkirche, Mozart\''s birth house, the Festspielhäuser - and the former horse pond Pferdeschwemme. The Getreidegasse, one of the most expensive streets in Salzburg, is also situated here, with St. Blasius Church at its western end. The Getreidegasse has always been the Linzergasse\''s elegant counterpart, though the latter lies on the other side of the Salzach River. It is one of the main traffic routes linking the districts on the right of the river to the city; heading west, it is also one of the main roads for those traveling to Linz and Vienna. The area around the Mirabell Palace is pure Austrian charm. The elegant palace, which is situated on the northern side of the river, has a beautiful park, which is elegantly landscaped in the style of bygone centuries. The square in front of the palace is best known for its market, the Schrannenmarkt. Farmers from all over the province meet here once a week to sell their high-quality produce. The small stalls around St. Andrew\''s Church further ensure that the area has a lively feel about it.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Side</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The area to the north of Salzburg is mainly residential and the buildings are more modernized the nearer you get to the main train station. The station itself is central to the city\''s infrastructure as the main means of connecting Salzburg to Austria\''s provincial regions, most of which can also be reached by bus.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Taxham</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A big US-style shopping mall is situated in the Taxham district and is called Europark, the city\''s large shopping-and-leisure center for a rainy afternoon. Nearby you find Red Bull Arena, Salzburg\''s soccer stadium, home of FC Red Bull Salzburg</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Aigen</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The district of Aigen, in the southern part of town, is known as a rather a well-to-do area.

The San Antonio Symphony performance season includes both traditional scores and pops performances, often with vocal accompaniment by popular artists like James Taylor and Willie Nelson. At San Antonio\''s historic Aztec Theater, you can catch plenty of touring bands live, while the Gruene Hall offers the best live country music. From its name, Sam\''s Burger Joint may not seem like it is associated with live music, but its brilliant iconic status and exciting line-up of touring acts makes you think twice. Next to the River Walk, the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts has hosted a number of large-scale concerts in the past, and has staged past performances by artists like Paul McCartney and Meghan Trainor. The H-E-B Performance Hall, a concert hall within the center is the proud home of the San Antonio Symphony, the Opera, and the San Antonio Ballet. Other prominent music venues in the city include the John T.

The Texas Transportation Museum and The Alamo are also must-visits.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As with any major city, San Antonio offers more movie theaters than you could count. While there\''s at least one in every part of town, a few that stand out among the crowd. If you\''re staying downtown, the cinema in River Center Mall is a great choice for first run releases and is within walking distance of many of the hotels. The fairly new cinema at the Alamo Quarry Market offers first-run features with shows as late as midnight. If not for a movie, stop in just to see the enormous quarry-inspired movable mechanical display in the lobby. For arthouse films, your only option is the Santikos Bijou Cinema Bistro. Finally, for larger-than-life films, check out the IMAX Theater adjacent to River Center Mall downtown. A perennial favorite is <em>Alamo—Price of Freedom</em>, which tells the story of the battle of the Alamo; it\''s a great film to catch before visiting the cradle of Texas liberty.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dance</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whether you want to get down with your bad self or simply prefer to watch, San Antonio\''s dance offerings fit the bill. If you like to dance the night away, be sure to check out The Bonham. Located downtown, this is perhaps the best dance club the city has to offer. Predominantly a gay bar during the week, the weekends and Wednesday night \"straight nights\" draw a very mixed crowd. Huge dance floors, a pounding sound system and the requisite disco lighting make for a fun, dance-\''til-you-drop evening. The place really doesn\''t start hopping until after 10p. The Davenport San Antonio, with live music plus cocktails, and the Ivory Nightclub, a popular haunt with DJs and a dance floor are two varying options for a night on the town. For those who prefer to watch the professionals, there are several dance companies that perform regularly, including the San Antonio Dance Umbrella and Urban 15. The city also hosts many touring companies during the year, quite a few performing culturally significant movements.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">San Antonio is an amazing city comprised of many different cultures.

San Antonio\''s biggest party, Fiesta, is a 10-day long celebration of the city\''s history and culture; it is held every year in April. Comprised of parades, debutante balls, street parties, concerts, sporting events and more, you are guaranteed to find something for everybody. So significant is this festival that the city practically shuts down on the last Friday afternoon so that everyone can attend the Battle of Flowers parade that winds through downtown. Other popular events include Jazz\''s Alive, and Juneteenth.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Considered to be one of \''america\''s 25 Best Cities for Shopping\'' by <em>Forbes.com, </em>San Antonio offers a wide palette of shopping experiences for locals and curious visitors alike. A multitude of malls like La Cantera, Shops at Rivercenter and the North Star Mall form the city\''s star retail attractions, although smaller shopping staples such as the Pearl Farmers Market and the Mexican Market at Commerce Street must not be missed either.

A historically significant area, the area is rich with a palpable aura of Texas\'' heritage, seen in monumental landmarks like The Alamo. The Alamo Cenotaph Monument lies nearby, inscribed with the martyrs of the Battle of Alamo. Across the Alamo Plaza, an arterial street that runs through the length of this downtown complex, a number of museums like the Guinness World Record Museum and the The Buckhorn Saloon & Museum offer plenty of entertainment. The La Villita Historic Arts Village, a local gem listed on the National Register sits on a leafy stretch of South Alamo Street, and across the River Walk, the Briscoe Western Art Museum brings to life the legacy of the American West, through a multitude of art exhibits and artifacts.

The area bustles with activity nearly every night of the week and almost all year long, with locals and tourists alike enjoying mouth-watering cuisine at Boudro\''s or Paesano\''s River Walk, singing their hearts out at Howl at the Moon. Not your average tourist trap, the River Walk entices many locals to brave the crowds and enjoy their city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">King William/Southtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If San Antonio gets funky, this is where it happens. Once primarily residential and neglected, the area has seen a resurgence of interest and an infusion of capital.

Wander just a few blocks from downtown and discover Rosario\''s. If you can, check out the area during a First Friday celebration. This community-wide celebration held the first Friday of each month draws crowds from all over the city for art openings, theater productions, dining and shopping. King William\''s quirky sprawl also features the Blue Star Contemporary Museum that overlooks the San Antonio River, and hosts brilliant art exhibitions in its bright space. Lavaca, a former market district that once housed several stores, artisan shops and small businesses, stands vibrant transformed, and accommodates a wonderful miscellany of bars, cafes, brew pubs, art galleries and even festivals in its colorful sprawl. SoFlo, a colloquial acronym for the South Flores market that commences every second Saturday at 10a, is also located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Alamo Heights</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the original suburbs of San Antonio, Alamo Heights harbors some of the city\''s finest dining establishments and upscale shopping opportunities. And with good reason, as a huge portion of the city\''s wealth resides in this neighborhood. For dinner, locals flock to Paloma Blanca or Cappy\''s. Beer and pool preside at the Broadway 50/50. For a gift for that special someone, you can\''t go wrong at Sloan-Hall. Bounded by the neighborhoods of Lincoln Heights and Olmos Park, this historic neighborhood is dominated by the presence of the University of the Incarnate Word. The McNay Art Museum, Texas\'' oldest modern art museum is located here, as are a melange of shopping centers like the Alamo Quarry Market, the North Star Mall and the H-E-B Central Market on Broadway Street.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Monte Vista/Olmos Park</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Neighboring Alamo Heights, this area is home to some of the most exquisite mansions in the city. At the very least it is worth driving through just to gawk. It is also a popular school and college district. You will find some wonderful neighborhood dining secrets, along McCullough Avenue.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North East/North Central</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping centers, housing developments and highways are popping up all over North East and North Central San Antonio as many new residents move in, both from out of town and from within the city\''s more central neighborhoods. This kind of rapid growth seems to require predictability, as is evidenced in the plethora of restaurant and shopping chains. The Uptown Central neighborhood is home to the rich and the famous, home to residences of celebs like Tommy Lee Jones and TV actor Thomas Gibson. The Witte Museum is located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Northwest/Medical Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The medical industry is big business in San Antonio, so this area continues to grow at a steady pace. Sort of a hodgepodge of strip shopping centers, restaurants, residences and office complexes, the atmosphere of the neighborhood seems a bit disjointed. Still, you can find great dining at Jacala Mexican Restaurant. Shopping is somewhat limited to chain stores.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">West Side</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Locals that feel the need to escape the city head out this way to dine at Rudy\''s BBQ and observe colorful marine life at San Antonio Aquarium. The next day, shop at all the antique stores in Boerne or spend the day at Six Flags Fiesta Texas or Sea World.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Yet, modern San Diego has become much more than just a harborside city. Spanning from the North County beach areas to the South Bay cities along the Mexican border, San Diego is one of the top ten largest cities in the United States. While all these areas fall under the San Diego umbrella, each individual community maintains its own personality, geography and identity. Truly, in San Diego\''s case, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (1786,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you should tire of admiring San Diego\''s magnificent natural scenery, the city has a number of art museums that offer eye-candy of a different kind. Balboa Park offers many of these treasures, including the San Diego Museum of Art, which offers an impressive collection of Renaissance, Dutch, Spanish Baroque, Impressionist, Southeast Asian and Contemporary Californian works. Also located at Balboa Park, the Timken Museum of Art showcases an extensive collection of Russian icons and 14th-century religious paintings, while the Mingei International Museum has a delightful collection of pottery, textiles, ceremonial and daily-use objects from around the globe. The work of some of the world\''s best photographers is displayed at the Museum of Photographic Arts. Meanwhile, Spanish Village Art Center offers visitors a chance to watch painters, glassblowers, sculptors and woodcarvers at work. Those with more modern sensibilities may prefer the Museum of Contemporary Art, headquartered in La Jolla with a smaller branch downtown.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">San Diego boasts a remarkably healthy theater scene with not one, but two Tony-award-winning theaters. The consistently excellent La Jolla Playhouse often originates innovative and provocative dramas and musicals. Meanwhile, the oldest professional theater in California, Old Globe Theatre, performs classic, Shakespearean and contemporary works on three stages in Balboa Park. In addition, several smaller companies, such as the San Diego Repertory Theatre and the Lamb\''s Players Theatre, stage year-round performances of contemporary works.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With giant multiplexes like the AMC Mission Valley 20, San Diego\''s cinemas offer plenty of mass, if not exactly highbrow, fare. Meanwhile, independent, art-house and foreign films are shown at the Hillcrest Cinema or the Ken Cinema, the latter specializing in revivals and cutting-edge independent film.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">First-time visitors to San Diego are often surprised by the variety of museums found here. The Museum of Man is an anthropological museum focusing on Native American, Southwestern, Mexican and South American cultures. In addition, the Junipero Serra Museum houses Native American and Spanish artifacts from the early days of the missionaries. Those not easily spooked should brave the Thomas Whaley Museum in Old Town, known for being haunted, a fact authenticated by no less than the United States Department of Commerce. Caveat Emptor, of course. With a nod to San Diego\''s once prominent status as a commercial seaport, the delightful San Diego Maritime Museum offers visitors a chance to tour three historic vessels. Furthermore, the Birch Aquarium boasts the largest oceanographic exhibit in the country. Nature lovers can indulge themselves at the San Diego Natural History Museum, which highlights the desert ecology of Southern California and Mexico. Meanwhile, science and technology buffs will enjoy the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center & Space Theater, which showcases a 3D tour of the ocean depths, rainforests and even outer space, all courtesy of IMAX.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Options for classical music fanatics range from large-scale concerts by the San Diego Symphony at Copley Symphony Hall to more intimate recitals by the San Diego Chamber Orchestra. The San Diego Opera season runs from January-May and consists of five operas performed at the Civic Theatre. For those with slightly less rarefied musical tastes, San Diego offers an array of choices in rock, pop, jazz, folk, country, blues, hip-hop and alternative music. Serious rockers head to the ultra-sleek Mattress Firm Amphitheatre, which seats up to 20,500 and has become a \"must-play\" venue for top musicians. The Viejas Arena also hosts big-name concerts. Smaller venues for upbeat tunes include Humphrey\''s By The Bay.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As far as baseball goes, the San Diego Padres have been the pride of the city. Playing in the National Football League AFC Western Conference, the San Diego Chargers have had a checkered record, but still manage to draw fans to SDCCU Stadium between August and December. Other prime spectator sports include horse racing and golf. From late June to early September, San Diegans place bets on their favorite thoroughbreds at the Del Mar Racetrack. This venue attracts some of the best jockeys and horses in the country. Meanwhile, the world\''s top golfers also visit San Diego several times each year at the Mercedes Championship at the La Costa Resort & Spa in January, and the Buick Invitational at the Torrey Pines Golf Course in February.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From beachfront parties to hipster hangouts, San Diego is as much fun after dark as it is during the day. North Park with its contemporary galleries, trendy shops and craft cocktails and beer draws a youthful crowd while those looking for authentic Mexican cuisine should head to Barrio Logan known for its colorful Chicano murals. The LGBTQ community finds a home in lively Hillcrest where the annual Pride Parade takes place. Among the city\''s favorite watering holes, the Belly Up Tavern with its line up of live music and the Gaslamp Quarter\''s many eclectic venues like Bang Bang promise a fun evening out.Whether your preference is for trendy nightclubs or traditional theater performances, San Diego has entertainment venues to please all tastes. Add sunny skies and ocean views to these top-notch attractions and it is no wonder why San Diego draws countless tourists every year.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1787,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Less than 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from the airport is downtown proper. This thriving commercial area with its active waterfront is a bustling, colorful combination of major hotels, convention facilities, restaurants, nightclubs and shopping venues. Its focal point is Horton Plaza, an architectural masterpiece that holds trendy shops, lively restaurants, a theater and even an ice rink during the holiday season. Just east of Horton Plaza is the Gaslamp District, a 16-block source of civic pride. Once slated for destruction, this area has been reclaimed by the people of San Diego thanks to the 1970s Redevelopment Plan. Where once dilapidated warehouses and run-down Victorian houses stood, and where no one dared to enter after dark, the Gaslamp District has now become the pulse of the city.Due west of the city proper is the Embarcadero, a fun daytime location where visitors can take in leisurely views of the bay, hop aboard a harbor cruise or enjoy seafood at its finest. For shopping, visit Seaport Village, a 14-acre (5.6 -hectare) shopping and dining complex designed to emulate early California-style architecture.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Balboa Park</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">No visit to San Diego would be complete without a trip to Balboa Park. Home to the world-famous San Diego Zoo, the park is much more than a beautiful place to see exotic animals. Gardens and grounds in Balboa Park were established as a city park for the people in 1868. In preparation for hosting the Panama-California Exposition of 1915, a celebration of the opening of the Panama Canal, founding fathers, architects and master gardeners collaborated to create the fine Spanish Colonial Revival-style buildings and gardens that still grace the grounds today. Additional buildings were raised on the site in the early 1930s, this time incorporating the look and feel of the Mayan civilization and California\''s early indigenous peoples. Within the confines of the park, visitors can enjoy scores of museums and art galleries including the Museum of Man, San Diego Museum of Art, Timken Museum of Art and Spreckel\''s Organ Pavilion.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Old Town</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For a taste of what San Diego was like in its earliest years, take in the sights and sounds of this colorful settlement, now preserved as a state historic park. Famous as the first European settlement in California, this area is also well known for its glorious year-round gardens, mouth-watering Mexican dishes, lilting Mariachi music and free-flowing margaritas. Be sure to spend a little time browsing through Bazaar del Mundo, truly a marketplace of the world.Within easy walking distance from the center of Old Town is the Presidio, a must-see while in San Diego. This structure, now a historic landmark, is where Junipero Serra established the first of the Spanish missions in California.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">La Jolla</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A short drive up the coast takes visitors to La Jolla (\"the jewel\" in Spanish), and truly a jewel it is. Despite its dense population, the people of this affluent city have somehow managed to maintain its beautiful natural setting. Cliffs along the main streets overlook the beaches and coves along the Pacific Ocean, tropical vegetation creeps and climbs across red-tiled roofs and verandas, and sunsets at La Jolla Shores are simply spectacular. Beyond breathtaking oceanfront scenery, this seaside community is home to the Birch Aquarium, which features the largest oceanographic display in the United States.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North County</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Travel a few miles further north along the coastal drive to reach Del Mar, another fine beach community. Famous for its racetrack, founded by Bing Crosby and fellow Hollywood cronies during the 1940s, this seaside town offers as much to families as it does to racing aficionados. Beaches here are clean and family friendly. Boutiques and open-air restaurants line the main street, giving it a Riviera-like quality. Just north of this city, visitors can find the renown Carlsbad Flower Fields and LEGOLAND California, great for those with young children in tow.Moving inland, the city of Escondido is a quieter, more rural version of San Diego, replete with avocado and livestock ranches, vineyards and granite-strewn hillsides. The community hosts the San Diego Zoo\''s 2,200-acre (890-hectare) Wild Animal Park, an extension of the city\''s world-famous zoo providing visitors a look at animals in the wild.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Bay</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Visitors would be remiss if they never traveled south from the city proper into the area referred to as the South Bay. The main city in this area is Chula Vista, home to one of San Diego\''s greatest music and entertainment venues, the Mattress Firm Amphitheatre. This entertainment complex provides state-of-the-art acoustics, VIP tables complete with cocktail table service, stadium seating and picnic seating on grassy knolls. While each district of San Diego has an original flair, the various sections blend seamlessly into a thriving, cosmopolitan city. From the North County beaches to the downtown shopping districts, San Diego\''s first-class attractions consistently please tourists and locals alike.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Across 3rd Street, the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts has interesting exhibitions, often of larger multimedia installations and kinetic sculpture, in its two-floor gallery. The De Young Memorial Museum in Golden Gate Park and the California Palace of the Legion of Honor (a handsome classical pavilion with Rodin\''s \"The Thinker\" at its entrance) are San Francisco\''s fine art museums. The world-famous Asian Art Museum in the Civic Center is also a must-see. Most of San Francisco\''s private art galleries are clustered downtown, to the east of Union Square on Geary and Sutter Streets. The more experimental galleries operate in SoMa lofts and Potrero Hill. San Francisco\''s other museums include the Museo Italoamericano and the African-American Historical & Cultural Society Museum, both at Fort Mason Center, the Contemporary Jewish Museum, and for natural history, the California Academy of Sciences. Zeum and the Exploratorium are designed for kids but are great for grown-ups, too. Kids will also love the Musee Mechanique, a fabulously low-tech collection of arcade games from the turn of the 20th Century. Formerly located at the Cliff House, the Musee can now be found at Pier 45 on Fisherman\''s Wharf.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">San Franciscans seem to enjoy movies more than most, and popular features can be sold out for weeks. New theaters open all the time to meet the demand, with the AMC Van Ness 14 offering 14 screens, and the AMC Lowes Metreon 16 housing 16, including one IMAX. These city-dwellers love independent cinema, too. In spite of the multiplex phenomenon, San Franciscans strongly support quirky rep houses like the Castro, with its mighty Wurlitzer organ, and the Roxie, with its funky and eclectic programming.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">San Francisco Ballet has long been one of the world\''s premier companies. The globe trotting and award-winning ODC/Dance also make San Francisco their home base. More experimental modern dance has found a friendly venue at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Theater.   The American Conservatory Theater (ACT) presents innovative productions of excellent plays, both old and new, at the Geary Theater. The Curran puts on commendable plays and musicals. Aside from the big touring productions at the Orpheum Theatre and the cavernous Golden Gate Theatre, and a handful of small houses like the Theater on the Square, there is quite a fringe theater scene in San Francisco. The Magic Theatre, a leading interpreter of Sam Shephard plays, and a few independent, theater-less companies do mount entertaining productions here and there. Performance spaces, such as The Marsh in the Mission, occasionally host experimental plays. The award-winning San Francisco Symphony Orchestra performs at the ultra-modern Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall. Touring soloists and symphonies play at Davies, Masonic Auditorium, and other venues throughout town. In the summertime, the natural amphitheater at Stern Grove (on Sloat Boulevard in the Sunset District) features outdoor concerts by the Symphony, the Opera, and other performers. San Francisco is inextricably linked with the history of rock \''n roll. The Fillmore Auditorium (of Hendrix fame) is a boon for rock fans. Slim\''s and the Great American Music Hall are engaging venues for performances on a smaller, but no less intense, scale.Many of San Francisco\''s Stand-up Comedy Competition winners have virtually been guaranteed television contracts. Cobb\''s and the Punch Line are two of the oldest, and most popular, comedy clubs where many got their start.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">San Francisco\''s shopping scene is a diverse as the city itself. From earth-friendly stores and home-grown fashion to the biggest luxury labels, this city has it all. If big-name brands and chain stores are what you\''re after, you\''ll find them around Union Square while more off-beat finds abound in neighborhoods like Hayes and the Mission District. Other places to explore include Chestnut Street, Chinatown, Fillmore Street, Haight Street and Polk Street. From vintage finds to off-the-runway looks, you\''ll find it all in SF.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you enjoy the outdoors, San Francisco has plenty of fun ways to enjoy the open. From surfing on Ocean Beach to hikes along Land\''s End, urban adventures at Seward Street Slides and wild-life adventures on Angel Island, there\''s more than enough to keep you engaged for an afternoon. If none of these sound appealing, you can always find something to do at Golden Gate Park. From disk golf to cycling and paddle boating there\''s more than one way to get your heart racing here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are nightclubs all over the city, but locals especially favor North Beach and SoMa. While these clubs mostly have DJs running the show, live bands are still common. Bimbo\''s 365 Club (a sexy, must-see, retro fantasy spot that puts on more blues and jazz than it does rock \''n roll), the Independent, and the Bottom of the Hill have all hosted well-known acts that draw the crowds and pack the halls.For a well-crafted drink, San Francisco\''s speakeasy-style bars and cocktail lounges invite you in to linger over a drink. Among the popular favorites, Trou Normand\''s exclusive spirits add an extra touch to every drink while Bar Agricole\''s artisanal concoctions will have you savoring every sip.One of the world\''s most gay-friendly city\''s and a pioneer in the LGBTQ rights movement, SF has a plethora of bars and nightclubs catering to the community. Among the top few, Cinch Saloon is one of the most longstanding institutions while those like the Stud have seen more than their fair share of celebrity patrons.Whether you\''re a dance-till-dawn or savor-each-drink kind of person, San Francisco\''s after-hours scene will leave you in a happy place.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1797,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fisherman\''s Wharf, Ghirardelli Square & Aquatic Park</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This area was once the thriving center of San Francisco\''s fishing industry. Many fishing boats still dock at the Wharf, but Fisherman\''s Wharf today is more of an extended tourist trap. Pier 39 is a great place to catch a view of the bay thanks to the delightful colony of sea lions. Aquatic Park features a beach of sorts, and a long pier spiraling out into the Bay. Old sea-dogs will enjoy adjacent Hyde Street Pier, where several historic ships are docked, along with the Maritime Museum. Ghirardelli Square, a chocolate factory turned shopping and restaurant complex, features some of the city\''s better dining and views. This area is nice for an evening stroll.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Beach & Telegraph Hill</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Originally settled by Italians, North Beach became a magnet for Beat Generation writers and poets in the 1950s. City Lights Bookstore and the cafes and shops on upper Grant Avenue still exude Beatnik funk. A new wave of entrepreneurial Italians has brought a sense of Roman style to exciting new restaurants along Columbus Avenue. On Broadway, barkers still pull tourists and sailors into charmingly seedy strip joints. Clapboard sea captains\'' cottages and mossy flower gardens seem to dangle in space from the cliffs of Telegraph Hill. Coit Tower, at 210 feet (64 meters), commands a stunning panorama from the hilltop. The Filbert Steps lead from the Tower down through the Grace Marchand Gardens to Levi\''s Plaza Park at the base of the hill.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chinatown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The greatest single concentration of Chinese people outside of Asia - a population of roughly 80,000 - live in the approximately 24 square blocks of Chinatown, making it the most densely populated area of San Francisco. As you walk around, you\''ll be richly rewarded by the sights, sounds, aromas and tastes of this vibrant community. Grant Avenue is the decorative showpiece of Chinatown, each year hosting the Autumn Moon Festival Street Fair and the ever-popular Chinese New Year Festival & Parade. The neighborhood is also known for its excellent Chinese dishes including freshly-prepared poultry, seafood, and the staple, <em>Dim Sum</em>.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Financial District & The Embarcadero</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">\"The Wall Street of the West\" - Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and the Transamerica Corporation (in its landmark, 48-floor Pyramid) are among the many banks and corporations headquartered here. The Embarcadero Center features dining, shopping, a fine art cinema, and a health club, while Justin Herman Plaza is the site of many New Year\''s Eve bashes. The Embarcadero itself fronts the Bay for miles on either side of the imposing Ferry Building Marketplace, modeled on the cathedral tower in Seville, Spain.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Beach/China Basin</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the city\''s most popular residential areas for young professionals, South Beach arose from a virtual wasteland at the southern end of the Embarcadero and the western edge of SoMa. Apartment complexes and boat marinas squeeze together between the foot of the Oakland Bay Bridge and the San Francisco Giants\'' waterfront baseball stadium, AT&T Park. Warehouses and factories have either been converted into stylish lofts or are being razed in a swath of development extending down Third Street to the Mission Bay development.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown & Union Square</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Union Square is the heart of San Francisco\''s bustling and stylish downtown shopping district. Posh department stores such as Neiman Marcus and Macy\''s ring the one-block square park. Hundreds of other exclusive stores, boutiques and shopping centers, such as the Westfield San Francisco Shopping Centre, lie within a three-block radius of the square. If you\''ve shopped till you\''ve dropped, pick yourself up at an outdoor cafe in tiny Maiden Lane, and restore the soul at one of the many art galleries on Sutter and Geary Streets. This is also the home of San Francisco\''s modest Theater District.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">SoMa</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once an unglamorous stretch of warehouses with a seedy undercurrent, an exciting modern San Francisco has emerged in the area South of Market Street—SoMa. Conventions, art, and entertainment possibilities abound in the Moscone/YerbaBuena Center area. Locals can be seen at leisure at theBrain Wash (a cafe/performance space/laundromat), or other fashion-forward restaurants and watering holes.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Castro Street & Noe Valley</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The center of San Francisco\''s gay community and a landmark for gay culture everywhere, the Castro is full of bars, dance clubs, restaurants, and one-of-a-kind shops, located in the commercial area around 18th and Castro Street. There\''s arguably more street life in the Castro than anywhere else in the city, especially on weekends. The gleaming neon sign of the Castro Theater greets visitors as they make their way down the street, with its Spanish colonial architecture and various blockbuster and independent film screenings. The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence sometimes make an appearance at special events (they\''re really men in nun drag) such as the Castro Street Fair, and take it from us - this is the place to be on Halloween. Trek up Castro to Liberty Street to see exceptional Victorian homes. Over the hill lies Noe Valley and its main shopping strip, 24th Street. Cute and relatively quiet, Noe Valley has enough great restaurants and gourmet food shops to make it sophisticated, but not enough chromed-up bars and Italian clothing boutiques to make it stuffy.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Civic Center & Hayes Valley</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Stately Beaux Arts buildings like the War Memorial Opera House and the domed, renovated City Hall are situated near the modern Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall and the Public Library\''s graceful Main Branch. The Asian Art Museum is also in the area, housed in the former Main Library building. Nearby Hayes Valley offers fine dining and apres-symphony toddies for concert-goers, as well as tastefully creative stores for clothing and gifts.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Haight-Ashbury & the Panhandle</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This small but densely concentrated cradle of the hippie movement has tried to retain much of its flower-power, peace and love appeal. While real Summer-of-Love generation hippies may be hard to find, young people, dreadlocked, skinheaded, or skateboard-crazy have continued to come to the Haight to break boundaries. The colorful bars and restaurants of upper Haight Street, however, are always packed with professional 20-somethings. The annual Haight-Ashbury Street Fair is quite a scene. Architecture buffs will want to take a look at the regal Victorians on the Panhandle—the grassy, tree-lined strip extends east from Golden Gate Park along Fell and Oak Streets.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lower Haight</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At once, the area around Haight and Fillmore feels more bohemian and less unsavory than the Haight Ashbury to the west. The streets are usually packed with college-age inhabitants who tote guitars and well-worn paperbacks. Ethnic restaurants like Persian Aub Zam Zam, unpretentious cafes, and independent bookstores are mushrooming in this neighborhood. The street life is lively on nights and weekends at popular haunts like Nickie\''s and Toronado.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fillmore Street & Japantown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fillmore Street, Pacific Heights\'' commercial spur, features noteworthy restaurants, epicurean food, and antique shops, all attended by a lively trade from young professionals. Fillmore and Geary have become a popular nightlife destination, thanks to John Lee Hooker\''s Boom Boom Room and the Fillmore Auditorium. Be advised that the neighborhood gets a bit sketchy to the south and west of Geary and Fillmore. The Kabuki Springs & Spa is  part of the Japan Center, the commercial heart of Japantown. A sort of miniature Ginza, the Japan Center features a 100-foot (31-meter) pagoda, bonsai gardens, sushi bars and other businesses. Each spring it holds the Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nob Hill & Russian Hill</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On impossibly steep Nob Hill, California\''s early industrialists built fabulous mansions that looked down upon the rest of San Francisco. While only the imposing Flood Mansion remains - now the Pacific Union Club - the area\''s five-star hotels bear the names of other Nob Hill denizens: the Mark Hopkins, the Renaissance Stanford Court Hotel, and the Huntington. Facing Huntington Park is Grace Cathedral, a 3/4 replica of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. Adjoining Nob Hill is Russian Hill, where San Francisco\''s old money has a great view of the Bay. The \"Crookedest Street in the World\" resides here and snakes down Russian Hill for the 1000 block of Lombard Street. The traffic is generally impossible - walk it!</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Marina District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tanned, fit and energetic 20-somethings run and rollerblade along the Marina Green, a vast expanse of grass fronting the Bay between two yacht harbors. Mountain bikers crowd cafes, restaurants, and brunch hangouts along busy Chestnut Street after Sunday morning rides to Mount Tamalpais. The graceful Palace of Fine Arts houses the Exploratorium, the one-of-a-kind, hands-on science museum—a must-see for those with kids. At the southern end of the Marina Green is Fort Mason Center, a waterside arts and cultural center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Presidio</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">14,000 acres (5,666 hectares) of forests and beaches, 75 miles (121 kilometers) of bicycle-friendly roads, a golf course, and scenic grandeur without end make this the jewel of the Fort Miley Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The Presidio was a military base from 1776 to 1994; antebellum Fort Point, under the Golden Gate Bridge, is a favorite for cannon enthusiasts, as well as for surfers, sailboarders, and Hitchcock aficionados (it\''s the site of Kim Novak\''s attempted suicide in Vertigo).</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pacific Heights & Presidio Heights</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Stately homes and high-rent apartment buildings line the ridge high above Cow Hollow in old-money Pacific Heights. Genteel, renovated Victorians ring the peaceful Alta Plaza Park. Washington Street between Presidio and Arguello features exceptionally palatial residences. Those fortunate enough to live here shop for antiques and dine in quiet refinement on a few understated blocks of nearby Sacramento Street. San Francisco\''s largest synagogue, Temple Emanu-el, can be found on Arguello Street.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cow Hollow & Union Street</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The grand, imposing homes of Cow Hollow (so named for its original bovine residents) are nestled against the Presidio where Pacific Heights dives to the Marina. Spectacular views are the norm. Straight, single yuppies pack the Balboa Cafe, Sushi Chardonnay, and other bars and restaurants on Fillmore and Union Streets. Clothes hounds can easily fritter the day away in Union Street\''s many upscale and tasteful boutiques.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Richmond District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fog-bound and quiet residential streets stretch to the Cliff House and Sutro Baths at the ocean, with the occasional Irish pub along the way. Some of the city\''s best Chinese restaurants are to be found in \"Little Chinatown\" on Clement Street, and Cyrillic lettering fills store windows around the imposing, gold-domed Holy Virgin Russian Orthodox Cathedral on outer Geary Boulevard. Exclusive Seacliff, home to Robin Williams and other celebrities, is next to Lincoln Park, site of the California Palace of the Legion of Honor and a spectacular golf course.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Sunset</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A quiet and intensely foggy residential district, the principal attractions of the Outer Sunset are the San Francisco Zoo and the natural amphitheater at Stern Grove, where free concerts are held on summer Sundays. As well as being home to the Strybing Arboretum & Botanical Gardens, the Inner Sunset features a lively stretch of shops on Irving Street, near 9th Avenue where students from nearby UCSF Medical School crowd ethnic restaurants of every stripe, from Ethiopian to Thai.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Mission District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The nexus of Hispanic culture, and a mecca for edgy bohemians, the Mission now houses increasing numbers of young professionals and their sport utility vehicles. Mexican and Central American businesses line teeming Mission Street. Visit popular La Taqueria, and be assured that the wait is worth it. Along the Valencia Corridor, one block to the west, bars, cafes, and restaurants of every description, notably Casanova Lounge, lead to the buzzing 16th and Valencia hub. Paxton Gate stands as one of the most unique among the array of shops in this stretch. The neighborhood draws its name from nearby Mission Dolores, founded in 1776. The dolled-up, postcard-perfect Victorians on Dolores Street are worth a look—in the daytime—from adjacent Dolores Park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\"></h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Golden Gate Park</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With 1000 acres (405 hectares) of gardens, meadows, lakes, golf, archery, and internationally recognized art and science museums, Golden Gate Park offers endless recreational possibilities for visitors and locals. The DeYoung Museum and the Japanese Tea Garden are some of the main attractions of the famous park, drawing millions of visitors each year. At the western edge of the park, Ocean Beach, although unappealing for swimming, attracts hard-core surfers with its rough, frigid and unpredictable waves.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (1806,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The quality of San Jose\''s performing arts organizations has risen in recent years to rival those of San Francisco\''s. The San Jose Chamber Music Society offers impeccable performances of robust late Classical/early Romantic fare at the Le Petit Trianon Theatre. There is, too, the Opera San Jose, whose productions are staged in the Montgomery Theater, and the renamed reconstituted, and revitalized Ballet San Jose. The ballet can be seen at the San Jose Center for Performing Arts. Additional ensembles include the San Jose Symphonic Choir, the San Jose Wind Symphony, the Lyric Theater (for light opera in the Gilbert and Sullivan tradition), and the folkloric Los Lupenos de San Jose.  San Jose\''s theater scene is led by the highly regarded the San Jose Stage Company, which has its own downtown stage; as well as the Northside Theater Company, the daring City Lights Theater Company, Latin-themed (but English speaking) Teatro Vision, and smaller comedic stages such as Big Lil\''s Barbary Coast Dinner Theater. Musicals thrive in San Jose, as well, at the American Musical Theater at the San Jose Center for Performing Arts and the San Jose Children\''s Musical Theater.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">San Jose\''s museums have come a long way in recent years, rising to the level of San Francisco\''s in the traditional fine arts categories. And they\''ve gone San Francisco one better in the techno-culture that is San Jose\''s purview. The San Jose Museum of Art, an architectural melange of new and old, usually hosts touring exhibits of national importance, increasing numbers of which are being coaxed to bypass San Francisco and stop at the SJMA instead. The San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art showcases the work of Silicon Valley\''s many talented visual artists. The San Jose Museum of Quilts & Textiles and the Peralta Adobe & Fallon House Historic Site are fine specialty museums. At the Rosicrucian Museum & Planetarium, you will find an entire Egyptian tomb that has been painstakingly reconstructed. The tomb tour is one of the better ones for kids, who will find it slightly spooky and thoroughly interesting. Another sure-fire choice for kids is the Tech Museum of Innovation with exhibits like a USD10 million \"clean room,\" where silicon chips are prepared; a virtual roller coaster, a U.S. Olympic bobsled team simulator; countless interactive learning stations dealing with computers, the Internet, and biotechnology; and interesting temporary exhibits. To top it off, there\''s a 295-seat IMAX dome theater.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Much of San Jose\''s nightlife is concentrated in the SoFA district in the downtown area. This vibrant neighborhood is home to an eclectic array of restaurants, bars, clubs and art galleries. For live music, the Ritz San Jose is a great choice while the OPAL Nightclub offers clubbing in a luxurious space complete with bottle service and lounge areas. The zen-inspired Temple Bar & Lounge is where you can put on those dancing shoes while sipping on cocktails in a zippy environment.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports and Recreation</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There is no question that San Jose has a tertiary importance in the Bay Area professional sports galaxy. However, San Jose is die hard in support of its San Jose Sharks, the Bay Area\''s sole National Hockey League franchise, who play their games in the SAP Center; the San Jose SaberCats, for those who like Arena Football; and the San Jose Giants, a AAA league farm club of the San Francisco Giants. The South Bay is known for its healthy, outdoor lifestyle, and there is more than enough to do if you want to get outside for some recreation. Runners have a variety of courses to follow. Mountain bikers are particularly fond of Rancho San Antonio County Park, but enjoy many of the other parks and open spaces in Santa Clara Valley, while the area\''s terrain and economy send packs of expensively equipped road cyclists onto its country roads every weekend. For roller-bladers, the Vasona Trail, a loop from downtown San Jose to the foot of the Santa Cruz Mountains, is very popular.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fun For Kids</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For those of sturdy constitution, there is California\''s Great America off Great America Parkway in Santa Clara. Along the same lines (but possibly less fraying to the nerves) is Raging Waters, a huge water slide development that\''s fun for the whole family on a hot day. Last but not least, a guide to San Jose cannot go without mention of The Winchester Mystery House. This peculiar, 160-room mansion, the lifetime obsession of firearms heiress Sarah Pardee Winchester, is a singular San Jose landmark. The Mystery House bears investigation if only to learn something about the eyebrow-raising story behind its construction.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For a great Silicon Valley shopping experience, head to Santana Row. This commercial district is choc-a-bloc with trendy boutiques, cafes, international labels and hip dining destinations - there are more than 700 places to choose from. In Downtown San Jose, the San Pedro Square Market is the place for home-grown products and independent stores in a lively setting complete with live music, great coffee and a great selection of dining options.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1807,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown San Jose</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">An extensive 1980s face-lift gave formerly downtrodden downtown San Jose a spate of five-star hotels and museums, a convention center, and an arena on par with any in America. All that was needed was a bit of refinement in the 90s to give it the cosmopolitan air of a world-class city. Thriving, sophisticated, and unquestionably moneyed, downtown feels like the Capital of Silicon Valley. Looking out over the Plaza de Cesar Chavez Park, The Fairmont Hotel reigns over a bevy of beautiful luxury hotels; nearby is the stately Hotel De Anza. The great number of popular bars and restaurants present a challenge to the visitor, while the galleries, coffeehouses and theaters of the SoFA (South of First Street) District give downtown a bit of SoMa/SoHo urban chic. Among the civic and architectural profile of San Jose\''s downtown are the  SAP Center (home rink of the NHL\''s San Jose Sharks), the massive San Jose McEnery Convention Center, the Tech Museum of Innovation, Children\''s Discovery Museum, the San Jose Museum of Art and San Jose Center for Performing Arts. In addition to being a cultural and entertainment magnet, San Jose is a working downtown. Software giant Adobe occupies Adobe Towers, which covers a highly conspicuous block of valuable real estate, and the nearby Park Center Plaza is home to a number of financial and technical enterprises. Downtown San Jose\''s parks add leisure and beauty to the somewhat forbidding technopolis. The Plaza de Cesar Chavez Park is the original plaza of the first Spanish pueblo and is now the site of outdoor music festivals and numerous other cultural and community events. Spacious Guadalupe River Park and Gardens is an attractive area giving breathing space to an increasingly congested city center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Willow Glen</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Willow Glen is a small and attractive residential community with a reputation for some of San Jose\''s most beautiful homes, built mostly in the 1930s in the Southwestern, Colonial and Italian style. The community displays an undeniable civic pride with manicured lawns, well-tended flowers, and precious mailboxes. Willow Glen sits just southwest of downtown San Jose, yet has an engaging downtown of its own along Lincoln Avenue. One can stroll Lincoln Avenue for everything from coffee to billiards to a fair share of restaurants and attractive boutiques. Willow Glen is particularly noted for its antiques, with the inimitable Adopt-A-Doll being one of the most popular shops.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Santa Clara</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The historic center of Santa Clara Valley is Mission Santa Clara de Asis, founded in 1777 by Father Junipero Serra. The makeup of the population has changed, of course, as has almost everything else about this densely-packed city. Its southern half is residential and largely middle-class. To the north are industrial parks which house some of the real giants of the technology industry: 3Com, Intel, Yahoo!, National Semiconductor, Applied Materials, and Synoptics. The Mission is still there, however (the present building, dating from 1928, is the latest in a series of churches destroyed by floods, earthquakes, and fires), on the grounds of the University of Santa Clara.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">West of San Jose</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Not actually part of San Jose, the Santa Clara County communities of Saratoga, Campbell, and Cupertino all incorporated in the 1950s to escape annexation. Los Gatos had incorporated over a half-century earlier. Saratoga and Los Gatos carefully maintain rusticated images, Saratoga as a genteel community of vineyards and gentlemen, and Los Gatos as a quaint, slightly raffish outpost of the maverick billionaires. Campbell and Cupertino are nestled between the borders of San Jose, Los Gatos and Saratoga. Each has a distinct downtown commercial district, but remain mostly residential communities. People who move here tend to have children: the Cupertino School District is one of the best in the county. Cupertino is famous as the world headquarters of Apple Computer.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North of San Jose</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sunnyvale is Silicon Valley\''s second largest city. Here you can find attractive parks well-used by bicyclists, runners and inline skaters. Retail stores and service outlets along El Camino Real and in its main shopping outlets take care of the basic necessities in this work-oriented community. The northern part of town is given over to the \"campuses\" of high-technology businesses, including Sunnyvale\''s primary employers: Advanced Micro Devices, and Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space. Mountain View abuts Palo Alto to the south. Castro Street, the heart of its downtown district, boasts some of the best restaurants, and in greater variety, than almost anywhere else in Silicon Valley. Fresh sushi, complex Thai food, authentic New York-style pizza, and bounteous Indian buffets can all be found in one block here, along with a fairly lively nightlife. Houses in Mountain View tend to be a bit older than elsewhere in the Valley, and pricier, too, as are the rents in its many apartments and condominiums. Mountain View has great parks, especially the 660-acre open-space preserve of Shoreline Park. Mountain View is home to Silicon Graphics, Netscape Communication, Google, Sun Microsystems, Hewlitt Packard, and Intuit, among others. Palo Alto must be mentioned in any discussion of Silicon Valley, primarily because of Stanford University. One of the state\''s premier universities (its perennial arch-rival, Cal, is to the northeast in Berkeley), Stanford is really the cradle of the high-technology industry that grew into contemporary Silicon Valley. Stanford Research Park, on Page Mill Road, the world\''s first industrial park, is part of a long, close and successful relationship between the university and the electronics industry. The main Stanford campus is attractive and spacious. Palo Alto today is upmarket, upscale, and expensive, but it\''s a great place to shop. With the trendiness of the college crowd and the taste of moneyed yuppies, the stores and excellent restaurants of well-scrubbed University Avenue always draw steady stream shoppers late into the evening. Stanford Shopping Center drops any pretense of catering to the college crowd and stocks only the best.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Despite being the nation\''s largest city, San José is small and cozy. Although its style and architecture are contemporary, some buildings of strong European influence, mainly British and French, can still be found as a heritage of the economic coffee prosperity from the turn of the century. Towards north and west of the city, we can still appreciate some old adobe structures with tile roofs that have been preserved with care, which evoke past remembrances of the large coffee plantations and farms. Although district areas do exist, these are small quadrants for property census and electoral organization mainly. The administrative division of the country was defined by regions or cantons which have their own municipalities, and can be considered as small urban zones and towns, with their own unique personality and characteristics. Thanks to the topography, there is a great diversity of micro-climates that determine in many cases the type of production on the region.

Establishing contact with the local people is easy, as by nature Costa Ricans are friendly and talkative. Holding on to its storied vibrant character even as day turns to night, San José packs in a plethora of nighttime entertainment that percolates into its busy streets and lively corners, with bars, nightclubs and watering holes for every type and stripe strewn across its rich neighborhoods. In the past few years, the city has opened up its thriving commerce to a numerous brewpubs and beer bars, an impressive line-up of local brews making their way from across prominent breweries in the city. Costa Rica\''s Craft Brewing Co is one of the best places to chug a cold one. Others like the Miraflores Disco Club, a little further from the city\''s limits in Heredia, hosts a roaring crowd that comes here to dance to Latin beats and electronic music every weekend. If you\''re looking for more local influences to while the night away, you will find that the reggae tunes and Latin disco beats in Castro\''s down-to-earth, yet popular haunt are very much to your liking. Club Vertigo, a slightly upscale alternative to San José\''s earthy dive bars, boasts a commendable line-up of celebrated DJs, ensuring a top-notch clubbing experience. Head to Bar Vyrus in San Pedro if you\''re on a shoestring budget but still want to have fun, and to the Jazz Cafe in the same neighborhood for live performances.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are a large number of museums in San José and each one offers the visitor a glimpse into this beautiful country. The Popular Culture Museum, the Childrens Museum and the Gold Museum (Museo de Oro) are ideal for the family. The National Museum narrates the history of Costa Rica and houses a tremendous amount of Pre-columbian art. For those lepidopterists (butterfly enthusiasts) out there, go to the La Salle Natural Science Museum and for something a little more macabre, there is the Criminology Museum. For more contemporary works, the Costa Rican Art Museum displays both international artists and local ones. If you thought jade masterpieces were only made in China, the Jade Museum proves this assumption wrong, since it contains some fine artifacts created in Latin America.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">San José has an innumerable amount of artists and no shortage of galleries to house their works. If you are looking to buy some art, visit the Andromeda Gallery and purchase some contemporary art at modest prices. At the Galeria Namu, fine works from national artists are on display as are indigenous handicrafts. The ever popular Galeria Roberto Lizano is a gallery with a rotation of artists from throughout Costa Rica, a place to see the true nature of this culture. Galería José Vargas is a gallery where the owner, Mr. Vargas, reproduces masterpieces from some of the greatest artists of all time, such as Da Vinci, Dürer and Van Eyck.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Eco-Tours</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Costa Rica is known to have some of the most diverse flora and fauna on the planet thanks to its varied topography. And although the country has its share of deadly, venomous snakes, there are other attractions throughout the city of San José that can let you admire them from a safe distance. The Lankester Botanical Garden is one such place, it mainly focuses on orchids and their cultivation while Zoo Ave, the city zoo has many exotic animals, even a 12-foot (3.6-meter) long crocodile. For the family, take them to the Spirogyra Butterfly Garden and learn in detail about butterflies, their reproduction and life cycle alongside more information about the natural history of Costa Rica and the preservation of ecosystems.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals & Celebrations</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In Costa Rica, it seems as if every day there is a festival or celebration happening, so no matter when you go, you are bound to find one. Religion plays a large role in the theme of these festivals and celebrations like San Ramón\''s Day where celebrants hold a procession in homage to more than 30 different saints, including San Ramon. Another festival remembering the patron saint of Costa Rica is the festival for the Virgen de Los Angeles. More secular celebrations include the Dia de la Raza (Columbus Day) which celebrates the Hispanic heritage and Guanacaste\''s Day, a day where the citizens of this town chose whether to belong to Nicaragua or remain as Costa Ricans. Another festival where the visitor can party at the beach is the Virgin of the Sea Celebration, this festival remembers the virgin of Mount Carmel with food, special masses, parades and music, all while getting a tan under the warm July sun. All Saints Day and All Souls Day is one of the most important festivals in Costa Rica, it honors the deceased and visitors should be mindful of becoming belligerent. On the other hand, to celebrate the living, Easter Week is where the whole country shuts down for days to hold massive processions throughout the streets. More secular and interesting festivals include the National Orchid Show, Day of San José, Worker\''s Day or labor day and University Week which celebrates on the campus of the University of Costa Rica.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Not so long ago, the Central Avenue was closed to vehicle traffic and embellished with stone paving and gardens, so the tourists and locals could walk by in comfort or just sit down and enjoy life go by. This pedestrian zone is now also a prime cultural hotspot in the city, centered around the terraced beauty of Democracy Square. The National Museum, the Jade Museum, and the Pre-Columbian Gold Museum stand as proud monuments of the city and nation\''s heritage, across from the 19th- century Parque Nacional, which features Costa Rica\''s National Monument. Along the broad length of Avenida Central, downtown\''s busy thoroughfare, you will also find a jumble of hotels, restaurants and stores, alongside the Tribunals of Justice and the National Theater of Costa Rica.  It is important to note that San Jose\''s Municipality has made great efforts to protect the security of is inhabitants and visitors as well, but some areas in downtown may be considered dangerous.

There are moderately priced small cafés and bars around the University and student boarding houses. Bed and breakfast and apartment hotels are nearby to house the tourists. This is a very traditional commerce area of malls, restaurants, and entertaining as well.  There are other more rural areas, farther from the city environment within San Jose. Puriscal, Tarrazú and Aserrí, as well as Acosta, Dota and Pérez Zeledón standout for the beauty of their scenery, with small markets of local products and artisan stores. The travel agencies have tours to drive you over, and there is always a public transportation service and car rentals for the adventurous one.

Its residential zones are ample and highly priced. Located in the foothills of the mountain, you just need to go up a few meters to enjoy a breathtaking view of the whole city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Santa Ana</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Heading West from Escazú a few kilometers on the same road, you will find the very impressive Santa Ana Valley. Its marvelous weather has helped to turn this zone into in a highly developed area in very short time. Many residents from the more dense areas, tired of the noise and turmoil have moved over to Santa Ana in a quest for tranquility and warmth.  The main produce of this region are onions that are planted in the area with great pride.

The art, music, and fine dining are available at every turn in this historic pocket of the big city. San Juan is inviting to the night owls who want to groove in hot clubs such as the Nuyorican Cafe, where energetic salsa nights keep the party going. Or, find fun at lively bars like The Parrot Club and El Batey, a fantastic dive bar in Old San Juan. The best place to have a festive cocktail is along San Sebastián\''s La Factoria, or La Unidad. The Cinema Bar 1950 offers patrons a miraculous blend of movies and mojitos by the Ballaja Barracks, while the Oveja Negra charms with its smooth speakeasy vibes.  Isla Verde in recent years has been converted into a mega-party district, housing several clubs. There are plenty of cafés and street-side bars along this strip as well. The lobbies of the InterContinental San Juan and the Ritz-Carlton have excellent entertainment, but the ever popular El San Juan Hotel & Casino is, without question, <em>the</em> place to be.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Concerts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">During the day, the City Hall offers several free concerts on the many plazas such as de Armas and Colón. The Tito Puente Amphitheatre near Calle Canales hosts concerts of diverse musical genres, and is also the site of the Puerto Rico Heineken Jazz Festival. The Hiram Bithorn Stadium and the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum are other venues for large-scale concerts in the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If clubbing is not your thing, there are plenty of museums and sights around the city to appeal to non-night owls. For art lovers, there are the Museo de Arte de Ponce, Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico and Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Puerto Rico. The Museo de las Américas also features an impressive collection of art from the Americas that spans pre-columbian to modern artworks. Literary enthusiasts will find the Casa del Libro worth their while, whereas the Museo de Historia, Antropología y Arte, the city\''s first national museum located in the University of Puerto Rico enthralls visitors with their striking cultural and anthropological dioramas.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A large part of the city\''s theatrical entertainment centers around the Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center. The center is considered the axis of the local theater scene with famous local and international performers visiting regularly. The historic Teatro Tapia, a freestanding drama stage that is considered one of the country\''s oldest, hosts both opera performances and theatrical productions from time to time. The Cuartel de Ballajá, another historic landmark that was originally founded as a military barracks, now hosts musical and cultural performances.

As the seat of the island\''s bicameral government, it houses La Fortaleza, home of the Governor and El Capitolio, the seat of the House of Representatives. The Senate, on the other hand, is located in nearby Puerta de Tierra. However, both districts can be found on the islet of San Juan and are connected to the mainland via several bridges. Old San Juan itself consists of narrow streets encompassing over four hundred years of history and tradition. Dine in one of the great establishments on Fortaleza Street, party in San Sebastián until dawn, or simply stroll along the charming avenues and thoroughfares. Similar to Europe, a famous tradition in Old San Juan is to people-watch, and there is no better place to indulge in this activity than from one of the several plazas that are located throughout the city. This town has something for all ages, young and old. A must-see is the impressive Spanish fort El Morro located on the north side of the islet.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Condado</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">El Condado, as the locals say, is the island\''s most glamorous district, featuring boutiques, a variety of restaurants, and some of the finest hotels on the island. Contrary to popular belief, many nationals do reside here in the exquisite turn-of-the-century mansions. You\''ll notice the populace on any given day to be a good balance between tourists and locals. If you are an avid jogger, you\''ll love the expanse of open area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hato Rey</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hato Rey is several miles from Old San Juan but is easily accessible. It is the island\''s central commercial district, where the local wheelers and dealers conduct their business. Thus, its restaurant scene caters to more business people than anywhere else on the island. Roosevelt, the district\''s residential area, can be found just off Highway 52. It is one of the most famous venues for nightlife in San Juan, and the Plaza Las Américas, the Caribbean\''s largest mall, is also located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Santurce/Miramar</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Both the Santurce and Miramar districts are located just off Condado and Old San Juan, but north of Hato Rey. Santurce was originally an upper-class neighborhood and entertainment. Today, there are office buildings and abandoned structures with a small but very good marketplace, the Plaza del Mercado.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Río Piedras</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This district is known as University City because it houses the University of Puerto Rico. Visiting Río Piedras is enlightening for those who want to explore the real Puerto Rico first-hand. The district has a traditional Plaza del Mercado and a very hometown atmosphere. It is the site of the San Juan Botanical Garden, and the Paseo de Diego, a pedestrianized street that is dotted with rows of mom and pop shops and boutiques. The Ponce de León Avenue, another arterial pathway, is famous for housing book shops and theaters.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Isla Verde</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Isla Verde is home to high-rise apartment buildings, huge clubs and luxurious hotels. This area is actually part of the municipality of Carolina, connected to San Juan via several highways and streets. It spans from the Punta Las Marías area (adjacent to Ocean Park) to the land just beyond the International Airport. Its nightlife is exciting, and the enormous <em>balneario</em>, or public beach, is where locals and guests come to sunbathe and get their fill of people-watching.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

History now recognizes it as genius. The original 420-seat, open-air theater perched on a piñon-carpeted hill north of town has been replaced. The opera has premiered dozens of now-popular shows. Each season offers old favorites and new, original productions. Designed by the renowned American architect who shares the amphitheater\''s name, the Paolo Soleri Amphitheatre is a masterpiece in a city that subsists on the arts. The theater provides a one-of-a-kind setting for entertainers like Carlos Santana, Dan Fogelberg, Bruce Hornsby and Paco de Lucia. The most historic venue in the city is the restored Lensic Performing Arts Center. Designed to resemble a Moorish Palace of the Iberian Peninsula, the theater was built in 1931. The Lensic was soon recognized as one of the finest palaces of stage and screen in the state. Desert Chorale, an internationally known singing troupe, is one of the only professional chorus groups in the country. They give a moving performance inside the hallowed sanctuary of St. Francis Cathedral every other week during the summer.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Each summer for a weekend in late July, more than 300 Hispanic artists, both traditional and contemporary, converge on Santa Fe to display their work at the traditional Spanish Market. Spanish Dancers, Bandoleros and modern musicians perform on stage in the Santa Fe Plaza during the event. Held on the weekend after Labor Day, Santa Fe Fiesta is the celebration of the Spanish reconquest of Santa Fe in 1692. One of the oldest civic celebrations in the nation, the event has run every year since 1712. In 1926, a new character, named Zozobra, was introduced to the crowds. Zozobra is a 50-foot (15-meter) animated puppet of paper, wood and pyrotechnics, which is set ablaze at the opening of the Fiesta. In a fury of fire, amplified moans, screams of agony and flailing arms, the beast is brought down, taking with it the troubles and strife of all who attend the moving ritual.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Santa Fe on the edge of the great outdoors is a destination made to explore the wild. Surrounded by the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the city is a leaping off point for all manner of adventure.

The ancient adobe structures, with their gentle corners and irregular earth-tone walls, bake in the strong light of the New Mexico sun. The hustle of the modern city teems to the south, but on the Plaza, life slows and the locals affectionately call their home \"the Land of Mañana.\" On the north side of the Plaza is the Palace of the Governors, the oldest public building in the country. Across from this grand structure, Native American artisans sell the fruits of their labors on colorful blankets at the yearly Santa Fe Indian Market. The remaining three sides of the Plaza are lined with boutiques, galleries, restaurants and jewelry stores that cater to tourists. East of the Plaza is the beautiful Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi, built in the Roman Revival style, that replaced the original adobe church that once stood here.If you walk south, crossing the Old Santa Fe Trail, you\''ll reach the Oldest House. Converted into a museum, this structure is considered one of the oldest in the United States, though its exact age is undetermined. It offers a fascinating look at the city\''s past. Also nearby is the Loretto Chapel with its unusual spiral staircase.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Railyard</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A lively arts district in Downtown Santa Fe, The Railyard is a hub for shopping, dining, and the arts in the city.

Many of the old properties have been converted into galleries, bed and breakfasts, and restaurants like Geronimo and El Farol.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Greater Santa Fe</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Like spokes of a wheel, three major arteries spear their way northward from Interstate 25 toward the Plaza. On the western fringe of the city, Cerrillos Road is Santa Fe\''s busiest boulevard and boasts the largest concentration of modern hotels and retail outlets in the city. Further down, El Rancho de las Golondrinas is a historic ranch turned open-air museum that has a fun array of activities and people dressed up in period costumes.To the east is Old Pecos Trail. This two-lane route to downtown is void of the high-density commercial zones that line Cerrillos Road, but a sharp eye will spot a number of appealing lodging options, like La Quinta Inn Santa Fe, and shops, like Jackalope, peeking out from behind the piñon trees.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rolling hills carpeted with piñon and juniper bracket the city to the north and create a setting for the world-famous Santa Fe Opera.

One of the most popular areas is the Barrio Bellavista, with its bohemian feel and its many restaurants, bars and discotheques.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theaters and Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">During the summer, the whole of Santiago becomes a huge theater, with numerous festivals and performances taking over the city. What is known as the Santiago a Mil (<em>mil</em> meaning a thousand) takes place in Mapocho station every day in January and competes with the many free theater festivals organized by various councils in the capital city, such as La Florida or Providencia. The Centro Cultural Matucana 100, a cultural center, presents a host of performing arts programs, while Teatro Apoquindo and Teatro La Comedia are other popular theater spots in Santiago.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife & Bars</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Santiago shines just as brightly during the night as it does in the daytime, its nighttime glow emanating from a host of neon-lit clubs that are filled with varying audiences. The hip Bella Vista neighborhood is where most reveling crowds and nocturnal cliques convene, and is the place where an assemblage of eclectic nightclubs cluster together to form a vibrant party town. From gay nightclubs like Bunker, to Club Ambar that does not stop grooving till 5a, to the infectious energy of the Illuminati, Bella Vista ensures that your night in the Chilean capital is a memorable one. Farther away on Constitución, modern partygoers will love the electric euphoria of La Feria, an electronic music fixture in Providencia that has been entertaining crowds for over 15 years. Blondie, a roaring favorite with the city\''s LGBTQ and university crowds plays ode to musical legends by playing 1980s disco music out of a retail center in La Alameda.Ruled by pisco sours and a host of fragrant wines from the Casablanca Valley, Santiago has a underrated army of bars that are clear winners in the eyes of anyone who appreciates a good drink. On the top of the list of Santiago\''s famed bars is the legendary La Piojera, immortalized by the former President Alessandri\''s visit. This longstanding institution is indubitably famous for its potent <em>terremoto</em>, a celebratory national drink that cannot  be missed. Others include the wine-wielding BocaNáriz, the much adored Chipe Libre, and the vibrant Liguria, a traditional favorite that excels at everything from classic Chilean recipes and pisco, and traditional live music. If you\''re looking for a more contemporary hangout to unwind, then look no further than Restobar Ky, an elegant space doling out fusion libations alongside Asian tapas. Etniko, Providencia\''s hip bar serves contemporary fare during the day, and transforms into a boisterous bar at night.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1855,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">República & Dieciocho</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Located eastward past the station and park along Avenida Alameda, the city\''s thoroughfare, are the neighborhoods of República and Dieciocho, which were once populated with the most privileged inhabitants of the country. At the end of the 19th Century and at the beginning of the 20th Century, they were heavily influenced by European culture, France in particular, and enriched during the mining boom. The Creole aristocracy created their mansions here and many enormous palaces still remain, although most of them now house various institutions and foundations. This area of past splendor spans the avenues of Libertador Bernardo O\''higgins, España, Norte-Sur and Blanco Encalada; this last avenue is where you will find Club Hípico, or the Riding Club, which was, in its heyday, the hottest spot where all of the best and well-connected would meet and socialize. Other attractions in these <em>barrios</em> include the Parque O\''higgins and the Museum of Military History.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Brasil</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Around this same section of the Alameda, to the north side, you will find the Brasil neighborhood, with a history and origin almost as rich as the República area. At the turn of the 20th Century, however, the wealthy residents of this neighborhood began to seek more peaceful regions towards the mountains; although the buildings and homes in this once-luxurious neighborhood went through a period of slow deterioration, the area was revitalized during the 1990s by artists and craftsmen who used the old homes as lofts and studios. Today, the area has a certain bohemian/yuppie flair, and has become a neighborhood of funky shops and restaurants. The neighborhood also enjoys an upbeat nightlife, with a host of bars, nightclubs and entertainment venues dotting its historic streets. The social life of most Brasil residents is centered around the lively Plaza Brasil, a popular landmark and hotspot for cultural events and festivals. Brasil\''s newfound youthful energy is also fueled by the student population that resides within the neighborhood, owing to numerous universities and institutions that are established here, including the Alberto Hurtado University and the School of Dance. Barrio Brasil, with its undeniable historic flair, is also home to a cluster of notable landmarks like the Basilica del Salvador, the Biblioteca de Santiago, Museum of Natural History, one of the oldest history museums in South America.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">City Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Slightly further east along the Alameda, you come to the city\''s civic center, where you will find the main ministerial buildings and the Presidential Palace, known as La Moneda. During the weekdays, the city center is a very busy place, with many shoppers, workers and university students going from one place to another. The University of Chile and the elegant Club la Unión are found right on Avenida Libertador Bernardo O\''higgins.  As you continue to travel farther along this main artery, the increasingly fevered pitch of the traffic and activity on the streets, as well as the taller buildings and larger crowds, all signal that you have entered the city\''s financial and business district. In an area comprising less than twenty blocks, you can see the Former National Congress, the Pre-Colombian Art Museum and the Courts of Justice. All of the buildings in this densely-packed region of the city center reflect differing styles of architecture and design, from old classical looks to austere, modern aesthetics. This is due in large part to a renewed zeal in building during the 1950s and 1960s, in which the designers and builders did not even try to stay in keeping with the former feel and tone of the buildings which preceded them. To know more about the daily life of the city, it is worth going down Paseo Ahumada, built as a pedestrian-only passage off the Alameda. Four blocks from the Alameda, the street ends at the Plaza de Armas. Remodeled in 1999, this historic plaza is framed by the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Central Post Office, the Museum of National History and the Municipalidad de Santiago, or Town Hall.  The walkway along Ahumada becomes Calle Puente once you pass the Plaza de Armas, and this road leads to the Mercado Central and the Estación Mapocho. The current station building was erected at the turn of the 20th Century, and was originally the hub for supply trains from the coast, which brought agricultural products and seafood to the capital. The market was built around the same time, in order to create a venue to sell the products brought regularly into town. Today, the trains no longer run and the Estación Mapocho serves as a cultural center where a variety of events is held throughout the year. The market, however, continues to be a must-see for those who like to sample shellfish and seafood.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">París-Londres</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One neighborhood that escaped this modern building surge is the Barrio París-Londres, which was completed in 1929 in what had once been the gardens and grounds of the Convent of San Francisco. Designed as a grouping of small mansions set along deliberately narrow and winding streets, this corner of the city was to be, from the beginning, an evocation of Europe in the middle of this developing urban metropolis. A mesh of cobblestone streets, 19th-century buildings, and Parisian elements collectively resemble Paris\'' Latin Quarter.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bellas Artes & La Chimba</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From this point, and extending to the east, is the wooded Forest Park, created during the building boom at the beginning of the 20th Century. It is here that you will find the National Museum of Fine Arts in the posh neighborhood of Bellas Artes. Towards the west extends the Parque de los Reyes, opened in 1992. Continuing toward the north along Calle Puente, and after traversing the metal bridge that spans the large Mapocho river, you will arrive at the most traditional and popular neighborhood in Santiago. Known since the early 20th Century as \"La Chimba,\" this community welcomed the immigration of Chilean locals as well as foreigners throughout the 19th Century who sought a better life. Because the city authorities originally saw the river as a natural border of the city, the inhabitants of this community over the river were left to their own devices until city officials sought more space for their spreading metropolis. So at the beginning of the 20th Century, a streetcar station was built in the area. Half a century later, the streetcars stopped running, and the buildings were taken over by businesses that had grown strong in the community. Today the neighborhood continues to be a populous, colorful and boisterous place, and is one more facet of this city that definitely deserves a visit.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lastarria</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Returning to the Alameda route towards the east, past the side street of Ahumada, you will come to a large French, Neo-Classical building which houses the National Library, inaugurated in 1924. The library is followed by the hill of Santa Lucía, which was used during colonial times as a quarry, and later transformed into an elegant park around 1875. The park is located opposite the Casa Central Universidad Católica de Chile. The Lastarria neighborhood is a traditional center of artists and is home to many theaters, art galleries and restaurants.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bellavista</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As you near the end of the Alameda, you will come upon the Plaza Italia, the original eastern boundary of the city. This plaza is a crossroads that gives visitors the choice of going north towards the outer boundaries of Forest Park, and passing through the bohemian neighborhood of Bellavista, which is packed with restaurants, bars, dance clubs and art galleries. This route ends at the hill of San Cristóbal, where you will find the Zoo, an art gallery and the swimming pools of Antilén and Tupahue. Another possibility at the crossroads is to follow the continuation of the avenue, which becomes Avenida Providencia, once a residential district which now features boutiques, bars, restaurants, hotels and modern businesses.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Providencia & Las Condes</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the corner of Providencia and Suecia, there are many bars and restaurants; it is an ideal place to get a table on one of the wide street terraces and order up a cold beer. The avenue of Providencia changes names once again as you pass the San Carlos canal. From this point onward it is the Avenida Apoquindo. Parallel to this street and running in the same direction is the Avenida Kennedy, a road which passes right by the Club de Golf Los Leones and, after crossing Avenida Américo Vespucio, leads you into the heart of Las Condes. Las Condes is a neighborhood comprised of modern and spacious homes, as well as the two largest shopping centers in the country, Parque Arauco and Alto Las Condes, both south of Kennedy. From this neighborhood, the mountain range of the Andes and its ski resorts are almost close enough to touch; just continue towards the east for several more kilometers, and you\''ll be there.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The city lies close to over 400 kilometers (248 miles) of the island\''s most beautiful stretches of sand. The best nearby beaches include Boca Chica, Juan Dolio, La Romana and Bayahibe. Visitors not only have access to white and golden sand beaches and the sparkling sea of the Caribbean, but can also participate in innumerable water sports. The many coral reefs, wide varieties of fish, crustaceans and dolphins combine to present an underwater wonderland, perfect for both snorkelers and scuba divers. To the north is the Bay of Samaná, where if luck is on your side, especially at Cayo Levantado, you might just catch a glimpse of the humpback whales that mate in the bay in the winter months. Visitors can rent boats for deep-sea fishing, as well as Jet Skis, Wave Runners, other small boats and other water sports equipment.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Apart from its shimmering beaches, there are plenty of options for outdoors lovers within the confines of Santo Domingo. The Mirador Sur park is one of the largest green areas of the city, and is a fun spot to picnic with the family. Also, you will be able to admire the endemic fauna at the interesting Botanical Garden, while the National Zoo is one of the largest in Latin America. A little further away along the eastern stretch of the city, the Los Tres Ojos, or the Three Eyes is fantastic outdoor realm that encourages exploration, featuring a medley of underground lakes hidden within cavernous depths. The Faro O Colon nearby is a historic lighthouse dedicated to Christopher Columbus, and also features an interesting museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Casinos</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Santo Domingo\''s large resorts offer Las Vegas-style casinos, featuring games of chance such as blackjack, craps, roulette, slot machines, poker and baccarat. Generally casinos open at 4p and stay open until 4a on weekdays and until 6a on weekends. Most casinos are located in the hotels.  The local bingo halls are also a popular choice, as the jackpots can sometimes get quite high. Others choose to go to the track and bet on horse racing.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A boisterous party destination that enjoys all kinds of revelry until the wee hours of the morning, Santo Domingo is a fantastic place to live it up. From traditional <em>colmados</em> that can be found in both Zona Colonial and Downtown neighborhoods, and upbeat bars that host full-fledged partying extravaganzas, to relaxed bars that serve well-executed libations, Santo Domingo\''s nighttime scene is both vibrant and dynamic. On a casual night out, head out to any one of the city\''s many <em>colmados,</em> local mini-markets that transform into low-key party spots at night, replete with alcohol and music. Else, head to the waterfront Malecon, or the historic Zona Colonia, where you will most definitely be greeted by a bar or club of your liking. The Donde Chame bar, a terraced spot with an atmospheric ambiance is great for unwinding with a drink, while the La Espiral in Zona Colonia not only serves delicious drinks, but also hosts live jazz and reggae music. For some heavy-duty dancing, the Jet Set Club near Plaza El Portal features a sprawling dance floor, a fantastic DJ, and a superior clubbing experience. But if a traditional lesson in partying is what you seek, then the Merengue Club will acquaint you with everything from potent cocktails to this sensual Dominican dance form.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Traditional Events</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Held every year in the month of February (and sometimes extending until early March) the traditional Carnival is well worth attending if you are in town. This celebration having El Malecón as its primary scenario, sees people wearing colorful and unique costumes flood the streets, while dancing to the contagious rhythm of merengue. Another event is the Festival del Merengue, celebrated in late July. Also celebrated at El Malecón, this event dedicated to Merengue, a traditional local dance form, attracts a large crowd, including both tourists and locals.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1865,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Colonial Zone</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city is divided in more than 600 sectors denominated <em>ensanches</em>, <em>sectores</em> or <em>zonas</em>. Among these divisions is Santo Domingo\''s famous historic district, which is known by many names, including the Colonial Zone, <em>Zona Colonial</em>, <em>Ciudad Colonial</em> and Colonial City. This historic center, declared World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994, boasts many fine architectural sites from the age of exploration and colonialism, including many of the first colonial monuments of the New World such as the first Catholic Cathedral. It also includes the first street in the New World, Calle Las Damas, the the oldest commercial street of Santo Domingo, as well as a multitude of restaurants, shops, bars, and museums. The Colonial Zone is limited to the west by the Río Ozama , extends up to the Parque Independencia, at its eastern limit, and ends at El Malecón, at its southern extreme.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">El Malecón</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Also known as George Washington avenue, El Malecón is considered to be \"the largest discotheque in the world\", and it is there where the famous Dominican Carnival is celebrated during the month of February.

Like a magnet, this palm-lined waterfront area attracts visitors who want to see and be seen. First-class hotels, some casinos, for those who want to tempt lady luck; clubs and outdoor cafes line this charming street.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Gazcue</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At a walking distance from El Malecón and the Colonial Zone lies the District of Gazcue. Formerly an exclusive residential neighborhood, Gazcue today is a blend of residential and commercial area where houses of unique architecture, mainly from the 1940s and 1950s, are preserved. Many of these residences have become businesses nowadays. This pleasant cultural area, highly populated by trees, is where the majority of the modern museums concentrate. There are plenty of them located at Plaza de la Cultura, a complex which includes the Museo de Arte Moderno, the Museo de Historia Natural , Museo de Historia y Geografía and the Museo del Hombre Dominicano. The Plaza de la Cultura also includes the National Theater, where national and international plays, ballets and other theatrical presentations, are regularly shown. This district also hosts various fine dining options, several of which are located in antique renovated houses that preserve the charm of the golden era of this privileged area. El Conuco, offering Dominican food, is among some of the restaurants located in Gazcue.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Zona Universitaria</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Adjacent to the Gazcue area, to the west, traversing the Avenida Máximo Gómez, is the Zona Universitaria district. Here, the first university of the Americas and the biggest of Santo Domingo, the Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo (UASD) can be found.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Naco</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Up north, taking the Tiradentes street, and crossing the Avenida 27 de Febrero, the sector of Naco can be reached. Once an exclusive residential sector, today, Naco is one of the major commercial areas of the city. It hosts a decent shopping scene, and hotels, banks, supermarkets, diverse dining options, as well as commercial establishments of all types abound in this area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Piantini</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Along with Naco, the nearby district of Piantini belongs to the group of the most exclusive zones in the city. Located between the Avenida Lope de Vega and Avenida Winston Churchill, this sector hosts quite a few modern shopping centers, as well as diverse entertainment options to suit all tastes. Plaza Central, a popular retail center, is located in this area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bella Vista</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Going down the Avenida Winston Churchill, departing from Piantini, the privileged Bella Vista area, delimited by the Avenida 27 de Febrero to the north and the Avenida Anacaona to the south, can be reached. One of the most extensive green areas in the city, frequented by nature and sports lovers daily, the Mirador Sur Park, is located here. The El Embajador Hotel, a preferred destination by business travelers and the Dominican Fiesta Hotel are in this first-class sector, where impressive houses (including Sammy Sosa\''s mansion) and luxurious towers, border the Avenida Anacaona and proliferate in the surroundings.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

From the local zoo to the Wet\''n\''wild São Paulo with its numerous water slides, the Parque da Mônica, and the Hopi Hari, Sao Paulo has much to boast. Or you could take the whole family on a trip to the Guarapiranga Reservoir, which offers boats and hydroplane rides, man-made beaches and natural forests. You may also visit nearby locations such as the Santos and Guarujá beaches, just 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the city.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Initially inhabited by indigenous peoples such as Guarani and Tupi, the city received a considerable population of African slaves in the 17th Century when the Indians succumbed to Portuguese colonists. Slaves provided the main source of manual labor for the coffee and sugar cane plantations, which in turn helped create the modern city. However, São Paulo\''s population grew very slowly until the middle of the 19th Century. At this time, the area we now know as Greater São Paulo was still made up of small scattered settlements, concentrated mainly around the present-day locations of the Pinheiros, Freguesia do Ó and Lapa districts.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Brás</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As coffee became the biggest commodity in the 1870s, the city prospered. Railways linked São Paulo with neighboring Santos harbor, banks and export companies contributed additional wealth, enticing more and more people towards the development of new districts. From 1870 onwards, the urbanization of the city took place as swamps were transformed into gardens. Brás, one of the oldest districts and the former estate of the Portuguese trader José Brás, along with the Mooca and Lapa districts, became the new home of Italian immigrants who flocked to the city at the end of the 19th Century. The immigrants influenced the culture of São Paulo and heavily contributed to the <em>paulista</em> spoken accent, which is markedly different from any other in Brazil. At the end of the 19th Century and beginning of the 20th, many farms were subdivided, and new districts such as Santa Efigênia, Bom Retiro, Consolação and Campos Elísios, (where the well-to-do lived at that time) came into being.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Liberdade</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Thanks to the construction of the first power station in 1890, electrically-driven trams were introduced to the city. In the 20th Century, industrial development created new urban areas towards the east, west and south, following the railway lines and the Tietê, Tamanduateí and Pinheiros river valleys. Japanese immigrants, who arrived at the beginning of this century to work in agriculture, settled in what is today one of the most traditional areas of São Paulo: the Liberdade district. Today, this area exhibits many aspects of Japanese culture, including some of the best Japanese restaurants in the world.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Jardins</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Smaller, older settlements around the city were incorporated into the metropolitan region over the course of time. From 1915 onwards, very elegant districts started to spring up, such as Jardim Europa, Jardim América and Jardim Paulista, which have today become sophisticated commercial zones known collectively as the \"Jardins.\" The Avenida Paulista is the Wall Street of São Paulo, boasting some of the most expensive office space available, as well as epitomizing the contrast of the different eras that so characterize São Paulo. Down one side of the street are historic neighborhoods and buildings, such as the Teatro Municipal, Viaduto do Chá and the Vale do Anhangabaú; and down the other side, one will find residential and modern office constructions with well-planned architecture and engineering, notably the Jardins district itself.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Morumbi</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Also on this side are the Jóquei Clube and the Morumbi district, where, besides the big mansions and luxurious residential buildings, you can find the Morumbi Stadium, one of the venues chosen by FIFA for the first World Club football tournament.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Vila Madelena e Bexiga</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Another district notable for both its culture and its gastronomy is Vila Madalena, which possesses a high number of bars and restaurants, and an intense nightlife that attracts professionals, university students and artists. Most of São Paulo\''s districts have acquired a unique personality as, for example, the Bela Vista (also known as Bexiga) neighborhood, where you can find most of the city\''s theaters, and patrons frequent numerous bars featuring <em>forró</em> music - traditional music from north-eastern Brazil.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Nowhere is this more evident than in the many small neighborhoods, which often seem more like pictures from a storybook than the corners of a 21st-century city.

Kevin Barry\''s Irish Pub offers live, traditional Irish music for those whose celebration of all things Irish is not limited to the city\''s gigantic annual St. Patrick\''s Day Parade. The Wormhole is another popular venue for live music; a neighborhood pub that welcomes all and sundry.Bay Street Blues is a deli and bar, and also a popular spot for live blues music on the weekends. Pianos, singing, and heavy audience-participation are the scene at Savannah Smiles Dueling Pianos Saloon. Most live music venues have space available for dancing, and it is always appropriate to move to the music in your seat. But if a true high-energy dance club is what you seek, try Club 51 Degrees, the Subzero Bar, Doubles, or Club 309 West. For concerts, head to the revered Stage on the Bay.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The historic Lucas Theatre for the Arts hosts events throughout the year, and is worth visiting just to see this beautifully restored 1920s theater. The Savannah Civic Center hosts a variety of Broadway shows, concerts, comedians and even the circus. The historic Savannah Theater is another anchor of the city\''s performing arts realm and is best known for its stellar lineup of musicals. The annual Savannah Shakespeare Festival is a highpoint of the arts calendar and brings theater to Savannah\''s famous Forsyth Park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A small town, Savannah does not have the spectator sports of a large city, but it does have plenty of sporting activities to keep visitors busy. The Savannah Sand Gnats, Savannah\''s minor league baseball team play at Grayson Stadium. Golf is available throughout the year. In fact, Savannah claims to have had the very first golf course in America, established in 1794. There are no golf courses located in the immediate downtown Savannah area, but there are many within a short drive. Savannah\''s Creative Loafing Magazine rated the Henderson Golf Course Best Public Golf Course in 2000. Southbridge Golf Club\''s semi-private course is another area favorite. Car racing is a southern passion, and Savannah offers racing enthusiasts Stock Car racing at the Oglethorpe Speedway and drag racing at the Savannah Dragway. Tired of walking? Bicycle rentals are available for those who would rather pedal their way through Savannah. Cycling is a great way to see the city. For a more open ride, try the 6-mile long McQueens Island Historic Trail.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Outdoors</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Savannah is a great place for fishing. Charter fishing trips can be scheduled for both inshore and offshore fishing for sea trout, red drum, flounder, king mackerel, grouper, snapper, and more. Tybee Island and Thunderbolt areas are home to many charter boats, most of which may also be chartered for dolphin watching and sunset cruises. If you desire a close encounter with nature, Sea Kayak Georgia offers sea kayak rentals, a kayaking school for all levels and guided tours of secluded rivers and barrier islands in the Savannah area. Kayaking near the scenic salt marshes provides an opportunity to view native wildlife such as sea turtles, river otter, osprey, herons, and a multitude of other birds. Nature trails are located at Fort Pulaski National Monument, and at the Savannah Ogeechee Canal Museum and Nature Center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In many ways, Savannah, itself, is one big museum. Many visitors enjoy simply walking along the streets and through the more than 20 city parks. However, true museums are scattered throughout the city. The Telfair Museum of Art, which consists of the Telfair Academy and the Owens-Thomas House, is the South\''s oldest art museum. The Ships of the Sea Maritime Museum features model ships and maritime art and the Georgia State Railroad Museum has old model trains. Museums within a short drive of downtown Savannah are the Tybee Island Lighthouse Museum on Tybee Island and the Wormsloe Plantation Historic Site on the Isle of Hope.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beaches</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you would like to visit the beach while on the Georgia coast, take the 15-mile drive from downtown Savannah to Tybee Island. This relaxed beach community is a fun day-trip for those staying in downtown Savannah, and a great place to stay if you think you will want to spend more time in the sand than on the historic streets of the city. Be sure to visit the Tybee Island Lighthouse Museum while roaming the island.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">River Street</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A walk down River Street is a popular activity, and a good choice if you are having problems deciding what to do. Here you will find restaurants, bars, and gift shops situated along the Savannah River. Sit and watch the boats and people pass by while you enjoy an ice cream cone. Many of the River Street establishments offer live music during the evenings and on weekends, and street performers are also common along the waterfront. River Street is also home to the Savannah River Queen, which offers sightseeing, dinner, and even murder mystery cruises on the river. While on River Street, check out the waving girl statue.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Family-Friendly Attractions</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Girl Scouts, young and old, will enjoy a visit to Juliette Gordon Low\''s Birthplace and the Girl Scout National Center. Low, who founded the Girl Scouts in 1912, was born in Savannah in 1860. Her birthplace, The Wayne Gordon House, is now a museum and the national center offers hands-on activities. The Tybee Island Marine Science Center is a small museum with beach ecology-related exhibits, aquariums, and a \"touch tank,\" where visitors can get better acquainted with some of the creatures of the sea.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1885,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Historic District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This two-and-half-square-mile district serves as the functional heart of Savannah, and the historic status is not self-decreed. Bordered by the Savannah River to the north, Montgomery Street to the west, Price Street to the east, and Forsythe Park to the south, this area represents one of the largest National Historic Landmarks in the nation. Here is where you\''ll find the picturesque civic squares—23 of them—that make Savannah famous as well as street after tree-lined street of ancient churches, monuments and museums, including the Telfair, which now houses the famous \"Bird Girl\" statue featured on the cover of John Berendt\''s \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.\" The historic district includes the festive shops and restaurants of River Street at its northern extremity, as well as the stately businesses and churches that line Bay Street on the palisade above. Here, at the terminus of Bull Street, sits the golden dome of Savannah City Hall, the site where General James Oglethorpe first set foot on Georgia clay. As you wander south, you\''ll pass the verdant city squares that have played host to such Hollywood notables as Forrest Gump and Jim Williams. As you move farther south through the oldest part of the city, you\''ll discover more than 2,300 historic buildings—about 80 percent of which have been restored—representing architectural influences that range from Federal to Italianate, and Regency to Victorian. Among the notable residences are the family estates of singer-songwriter Johnny Mercer, and Girl Scouts founder Juliette Gordon Low.The historic district is also home to many of the city\''s seasonal festivals, the Savannah College of Art and Design, and a good number of Savannah\''s most revered restaurants and inns. Favorites include the ritzy Ballastone Inn, a former bordello that dates back to 1838.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Riverfront</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As suggested by the name, this area runs along the length of the Savannah River, the city\''s northern border. Once the nerve center of Savannah\''s booming cotton trade, the neighborhood began to deteriorate after the yellow fever quarantine and subsequent depression of 1818. Abandoned for over a century, the riverfront was resurrected in 1977, as the sprawling brick warehouses and merchant buildings were transformed into a parade of shops, restaurants and art galleries. Since then, the area has developed into the most popular destination for visitors, and maintains a festive atmosphere that lasts well into the night. Restaurants such as Huey\''s, the lively Shrimp Factory and the elegant Chart House sit alongside quaint shops that peddle everything from nautical gear to kudzu soup mix. The cobblestone River Street also serves as ground zero for the city\''s annual St. Patrick\''s Day Parade and celebration, and the monthly First Saturday Arts and Crafts Festival. If you\''re looking to stay in the center of the action, book a room at the extravagant Hyatt Regency at the west end of the street, or try the more historic River Street Inn a bit farther east.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">City Market</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once the bustling center of Savannah culture, commerce and society, City Market also sits on the river, a bit north of River Street at Jefferson and West Julian. Like River Street, the brick warehouses of this small area languished in disrepair after the death of King Cotton, but have been reclaimed by the city and now host droves of tourists. Shops, restaurants and some of the Savannah\''s coolest clubs draw daily crowds, with frequent live music and performances lending a festive atmosphere to this busy corner of the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Victorian District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This 50-block neighborhood is situated just south of the historic district, between Martin Luther King Boulevard and East Broad Street. Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, this area represents the first suburb of Savannah as the city spread out in the late 1800s. Largely residential, the neighborhood features examples of many architectural styles, with an unsurprising abundance of Victorian structures.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Midtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Midtown is a large area that incorporates the Victorian District and points south as far as DeRenne Avenue. As the neighborhood progresses southward along Abercorn Street, the residences become more modern, businesses appear, and the charm of old Savannah fades rapidly. One exception, however, is the tiny town of Thunderbolt, a quaint fishing village just to the east on the Wilmington River. Midtown is home to much of Savannah\''s medical community, as well as Armstrong Atlantic State University and Savannah State University. Sports fans will want to visit Grayson Stadium.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Southside</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\''s hard to say where Midtown ends and Southside begins, but DeRenne Avenue is considered a fair mark. This is where the suburban sprawl of the 1950s and 1960s really hit, as evidenced by the uninspiring residential neighborhoods intermingled with countless strip malls, fast food joints, and car dealerships. Hunter Army Airfield, from whose enormous runway the US Army deploys servicemen worldwide, anchors the area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Savannah\''s Islands</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The low country surrounding the city harbors many small islands, including the residential boom areas of Wilmington and Whitemarsh, and the touchingly quaint Isle of Hope, whose antebellum homes and verdant lawns are the stuff of Dixie dreams. Nearby, Skidaway Island is the site of golfing communities, marinas, and miles of biking and nature trails. Skidaway is also home to the Wormsloe Historic Site, a comprehensive colonial settlement restoration. Savannah\''s seaside playground, however, is Tybee. Just 15 miles east of downtown past Fort Pulaski National Monument, Tybee Island features a wonderland of crab shacks, expensive condos, party hotels and cheesy gift shops, as well as the oldest lighthouse on the South Atlantic seaboard.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

At SAM, look for rotating modern art shows, and be sure to check out the Native American and African galleries. The contemporary art shows at the Henry Art Gallery at the University of Washington always have an academic background and a flair for challenging conceptions. The Center on Contemporary Art (CoCA) and a host of edgy galleries like James Harris and Greg Kucera, showcase young, enthusiastic local talent. Check it all out during the monthly neighborhood Artwalks, during which galleries stay open late and serve wine and cheese.  The Frye Art Museum has a pleasant collection of 19th and 20th Century paintings, while the Museum of History and Industry covers the same time period but with its focus on Seattle\''s history. The Burke Museum and the Museum of Flight offer glimpses of natural history and Boeing science respectively, with towering artifacts (dinosaurs and airplanes, naturally) at both.  The history of Seattle\''s ethnic minorities gets a thoughtful, detailed look at the Wing Luke Asian Museum. The Seattle Children\''s Museum and the Pacific Science Center, both at the Seattle Center, are paradises of activities for kids. Further afield, the Bellevue Art Museum has a good collection of 20th Century art. The Museum of Pop Culture displays truly captivating exhibits from the pop culture realm across genres, and has several interactive displays in its Frank Gehry-designed building. The Chihuly Garden and Glass exhibit nearby is a stunning display of Dale Chihuly\''s glass installation, a visually striking modern sculpture that stretches for over 100-feet (30.48 meters) along the expanse of the glass-walled museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hollywood glitz rules the downtown scene at Pacific Place. Art-house funkiness rules Capitol Hill at the SIFF Cinema Egyptian Theatre, and over the University District at the Neptune, the Varsity Theatre, and the Grand Illusion. Those with various tastes can have fun at the various annual film festivals held in the city, where sneak previews of blockbusters play alongside world cinema. The biggest festival is the Seattle International Film Festival, which takes the town over for three weeks in May and June. Also keep a lookout for the Seattle Lesbian and Gay Film Festival.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Seattle\''s vast sprawl accommodates a wide and dynamic repertoire of fantastic performing arts that keep denizens and vacationing audiences engaged throughout the year - whether it is brilliant theater, rib-tickling comedy, dance, or classical opera or concerts, Seattle has it all.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Seattle Symphony performs in the acoustically crisp Benaroya Hall, which also provides much-needed concert space for the excellent Seattle Men\''s Chorus and other classical groups. The past few years have also seen the rise of an early-music movement, with several period ensembles garnering acclaim and audiences under the aegis of the Early Music Guild. Churches around town and the Seattle Art Museum often stage lovely chamber music concerts as well. Experimental rock groups and other combinations of world, funk and pop music play frequently at the Showbox and the Crocodile Cafe. Jazzmen and blues masters hold down regular gigs at the Tractor Tavern. For more jazz, the sleek Sea Monster Lounge deserves a mention, while Columbia City Theater is a colorful ex-vaudeville venue is known for previously hosting performances by Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald.

These companies put on strong seasons every year, usually comprised of modern classics and premieres. Fringe theater groups, such as the Annex Theater, the Book-It Repertory Theatre and Theater Schmeater provide well-produced, eclectic alternatives. There\''s also a manic fringe festival in early spring, when dozens of groups materialize out of nowhere to put on shows. In the niche bracket, Seattle Children\''s Theatre presents extremely professional, creative productions for kids ages 4-14, while the historic 5th Avenue Theatre brings Broadway musicals to town.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Comedy</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Open-mic nights and laugh-till-your-sides-hurt comedy shows are one of the things that keep Seattle\''s denizens fresh and alive.

The district is home to the inner-city oasis Hing Hay Park, complete with a pagoda and the Wing Luke Asian Museum.The neighborhood, while primarily populated with Chinese immigrants, also consists of a smattering of Vietnamese and Japanese families who have made this place home. Other landmarks include the Kobe Terrace and the Danny Woo International District Community Garden. Festivals such as the Lunar New Year are celebrated here, and the district is also home to a lovely night market that comes alive in early fall.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pike Place Market/Belltown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pike Place Market is the heart of Seattle and the number one tourist site in the area, attracting frenzied crowds of visitors and locals. The oldest continually operating farmer\''s market in the country, Pike Place features fresh fish, fruits and vegetables, and arts and crafts as far as the eye can see. Abundant restaurants include Maximilien in the Market. Shops offer goods from around the world. Bring some change as there are always street musicians and buskers singing for their supper. This is also the home of the first Starbucks coffee store, located at 1912 Pike Place. The Moore Theater, Seattle\''s oldest operating theater, and the Seattle Aquarium are also located here.  If you venture further north of Pike Place, the cool and trendy neighborhood of Belltown unfolds before you, a dynamic area filled with fashionable boutiques, art galleries, bars and sky-piercing condominiums. The area receives a large share of Downtown\''s yuppie crowd that begin trickling into the area after hours, unwinding at its hip bars and nightclubs such as the Crocodile Cafe after a long day at work. It is also known for its scenic offerings, with the waterfront Olympic Sculpture Park providing sweeping views of the Puget Sound, as well as fascinating visitors with its wonderful array of sculptures and nature trails.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pioneer Square</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is Seattle\''s oldest neighborhood and the place where the term \"Skid Row\" originated. Lumberjacks skidded logs down \"Skid Road,\" now Yesler Street, to a mill at the bottom of the hill. Saloons and brothels lined the street, and the term soon took on its derogatory connotation locally and nationwide. The Underground Tour explores the now subterranean storefronts of the original neighborhood. Today the neighborhood is filled with art galleries, small shops, bookstores, including Elliott Bay Book Co., and restaurants like the elegant Il Terrazzo Carmine. At night the square comes to life. Popular nightspots include Central Saloon, one of Seattle\''s oldest bars. Many clubs feature live music, and a group of bars and clubs in the area offers admittance to each for a single cover charge. Occidental Square, a leafy public space is sprawled in the midst of Pioneer Square, not far away from Smith Tower and other landmarks like the Sky View Observatory Columbia Center and the Seattle City Hall.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">First Hill</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Extending beyond Downtown\''s tourist-dominated center is the neighborhood of First Hill, a predominantly cultural area characterized by a warren of modern homes, stately manors and mansions, and hospitals, intermittently speckled with art museums, cafes, and a miscellany of small restaurants. Its most notable landmarks include the Frye Art Museum, the Seattle University and its surrounding campus, and the historic town hall, and the Renaissance-themed St James Cathedral.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Capitol Hill</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Yes, this Washington city has one too and its mix of eclectic shops, art-house theaters, wonderful restaurants and interesting people make it one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Seattle. Some of the city\''s most historic houses are located here, as is Volunteer Park. Seattle University and Cornish College of the Arts also border this hill. The park is also home to the Lake View Cemetery, the resting place of several of the city\''s founders, and of father-son duo Bruce Lee and Brandon Lee. In recent years, Capitol Hill has also become widely known for its role in the activities of the LGBT community, and also boasts a vivacious nightlife, with landmark bars like Pony and Garage located here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Alki Beach</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">About as close as Seattle gets to California, this sandy beach in West Seattle draws swarms of walkers, joggers, bikers, skaters, scuba divers and volleyball players. Cafes and restaurants such as Salty\''s on Alki line the main street, ready to nourish those who\''ve played at the beach all day. Alki Beach, directly across Elliott Bay from downtown, is the spot where the first European settlers camped in the winter of 1851 before they moved to the more sheltered area that is now downtown. The Log House Museum and a handful of boutiques are located here as well.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ballard</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Affectionately known for slow drivers and the lilting accents of its many residents of Scandinavian descent, this area was first settled by immigrant Nordic fishermen and mill workers. Visit the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks to watch boats travel from salt water to freshwater, then take a trip to Golden Gardens Park to watch the sunset. Popular restaurants in the area include Ray\''s Boathouse and Bad Albert\''s Tap & Grill. Stop by Fisherman\''s Terminal for a look at the boats that keep the fishing industry thriving.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fremont</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hip and eclectic, Fremont is always a fun place to go. The sign that says \"Welcome to the Center of the Universe\" is the first clue that you\''ve arrived. Oddities like the Freemont Troll, a smoking rocket and a bronzed Vladimir Lenin statue will leave you laughing while the Saturday gallery walks and the Fremont Sunday Flea Market will have you browsing. Say hello to the group waiting for a bus, but don\''t expect an answer—they\''re life-sized statues, often dressed in celebration of someone\''s birthday or another grand event. The Fremont Oktoberfest is also held here each year.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Madison Park</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Quaint shops, restaurants and cafes fill this upper-crust neighborhood on the shores of Lake Washington. The Washington Park Arboretum fills you with a renewed energy as you walk along its scenic pathways and flower-filled corners, while the Seattle Japanese Garden\''s cherry orchards and teahouse ceremonies brighten up even the bleakest Seattle day. Walk down the street to the Madison Park & Beach, take in the beautiful view of the Eastside, and dream about owning a waterfront villa. The Museum of History and Industry can also be found in Madison Park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Queen Anne Hill</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A combination of a quiet hilltop neighborhood and a young trendy hot spot, Queen Anne has popular restaurants like Peso\''s Taco Lounge as well as coffee shops and nightspots. The view of the city from the west slope is incredible, especially from Kerry Park, which offers Seattle\''s most photographed view. Split into North Queen Anne and Lower Queen Anne, this scenic neighborhood is dominated by landmarks like the Seattle Center. Part amusement park, part festival grounds, the center hosts The Bite of Seattle, Bumbershoot and many other popular festivals. Permanent fixtures of this 74-acre (29-hectare) park include the Intiman Theater, Paul Allen\''s Experience Music Project Museum, the Pacific Science Center and the Space Needle.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">University District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This area is home to the University of Washington, known to locals as \"U-Dub.\" The park-like 700-acre (283-hectare) campus is perfect for a midday stroll. Boats filled with die-hard Husky fans fight for space around the waterfront stadium on game days. Low-priced restaurants and pubs like line the \"Ave\" (University Avenue), and stylish young people fill the streets. The University Bookstore anchors a thriving shopping scene. The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, the Henry Art Gallery, the Husky Stadium and the Center for Urban Horticulture are all part of this sprawling district.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Waterfront</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Elliott Bay, part of Puget Sound, laps against Seattle\''s Waterfront. On summer days, visitors pack the area to enjoy the fresh air, quaint shops and many seafood restaurants, which include Elliott\''s Oyster House, Anthony\''s Pier 66, and Ivar\''s. Catch a ferry to Bremerton or Bainbridge Island, or take a water tour to Blake Island\''s Tillicum Village for a salmon dinner and Native American dance show.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Redmond</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Thriving due to corporate residents like Microsoft and Nintendo, Redmond has an unlikely yet appealing combination of countryside and technology. The software industry brings money here and with it good shopping at Redmond Town Center. Cyclists appreciate the velodrome at Marymoor Park and the Lake Sammamish State Park Trail.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kirkland</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Across Lake Washington from Seattle lies the \"Monterey of the Northwest,\" so called for its posh art galleries, boutiques, restaurants and waterfront. The Kirkland Performance Center can be found here. While close to the city, Kirkland manages to maintain its small-town atmosphere, which adds to its appeal.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The city itself is a museum that has to be discovered by walking through its streets or by taking a ride in a horse and carriage, but without forgetting the obligatory sights of the cathedral, the Giralda, the Reales Alcázares and the Torre del Oro, which houses the Museo Naval. Among the most interesting spaces is the Museo de Bellas Artes, with pictures by Pacheco, Roelas and, above all, Murillo. The Museo Arqueológico, (Archaeological Museum) in the Parque de María Luisa contains pieces from the old Roman town of Itálica, and the Museo de Artes y Costumbres Populares takes you on a trip through the traditions of Andalusian culture. In the Plaza de Toros is the Museo Taurino, and two centers occupied with the new movements are the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo and the Centro Andaluz de Arte Contemporáneo, in the isla de Cartuja.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Seville has plenty to offer the movie buff, with lots of cinemas (most of them multiplexes) so that it is easy to find the film that suits you. For their spaciousness, these cinemas stand out: the Nervión Plaza, with 20 screens, and Los Arcos Multicines, with 12. If you like traditional cinemas with just one large screen, there is only one choice: Cervantes, with beautiful interior architecture.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For opera and classical music concerts in Seville there is the Teatro de la Maestranza, but you can also see live rock and pop in the studios of Fun Club or in late night bars like La Carbonería, which dedicates one day a week to Blues. One of the cradles of flamenco, Seville is a propitious place for this art. That\''s why performances and festivals take place throughout the year in Seville and its province. Every night you can listen to flamenco while having dinner or a drink in the Palacio Andaluz, or El Arenal.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">T</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">here are theaters dedicated to the classics, such as the Teatro Lope de Vega, theaters specializing in new movements, like the Teatro Central, and children\''s theaters, like the Teatro de la Alameda. For alternative productions, there are the Sala La Imperdible, and the Sala Cero.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Seville\''s vibrant neighborhoods are all veritable hotspots to enjoy the city\''s nightlife, from laidback bars and frenzied nightclubs lining the streets.  El Arenal, one of the city\''s traditional districts, is right next to the Plaza de Toros and is a good place to have a drink, either inside or outside one of the many bars that line the streets. Among them is Arenal (El), which offers a nice atmosphere and good music. In the same area there are gay bars. There are places to drink and enjoy the pleasant summer evenings on either side of the Guadalquivir river as well, especially on the \''<em>sevillana</em>\'' bank.The Alameda de Hércules is one of the liveliest areas, though you should take care here because it is a little dangerous after hours. However, you can enjoy the action in the city\''s most bohemian atmosphere in El Habanilla or the Bulebar, live music venues like Fun Club, gay bars like El Baron Rampante, Naima or the Alameda 84. There are plenty of good drinking places in the old part of town as well. The best thing to do is first drink a few beers in the middle of the street in Plaza del Salvador. Then you could move on to Bestiario. There are also classic, hip places like Sopa de ganso. Las juderias also has plenty of drinking and tapas bars in its narrow winding streets, though it is advisable to move towards the Cathedral as the night gets on. Among them, all more or less in the same area, is Las Columnas.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1915,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Historical Seville</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Visitors find this part of the city interesting because of the artistic and architectural wealth represented here. You will find the districts of Santa Cruz and the Judería (Jewish Quarter), El Arenal, la Alameda de Hércules, and an area referred to by some as the Acropolis, with significant monuments such as the Catedral (Cathedral) the Giralda, the Reales Alcázares (Royal Fortresses) and the Ayuntamiento (Town Hall), all of which are of immense artistic interest and contain valuable works of art such as paintings and sculptures.  The Arco del Postigo del Aceite (Arch of the Oil Gate) divides the Acropolis from the district of Arenal, where you will find the Plaza de Toros de la Maestranza (Maestranza Bull Ring) and the Teatro de la Maestranza (Maestranza Theatre), the Torre de la Plata (Silver Tower) and the Hospital de la Caridad (Charity Hospital) and the most famous of them all, the Torre del Oro (Golden Tower). This is a busy commercial area with many small shops, and it is one of the most popular areas among the \''<em>movida juvenil</em>\'' (young people) especially in the calle Adriano in autumn and on the left bank of the Guadalquivir in spring.  It is beautiful to walk through the narrow streets of the districts of Santa Cruz and the Jewish quarter; you catch glimpses of the Giralda over the rooftops from time to time. It was here that the Jews and Hebrews established themselves after the reconquest of the city by Ferdinand III The Saint. The churches are outstanding, many of them crafted in Mudejar style or with beautiful Gothic ogives (pointed arches or windows). The Alameda de Hércules is one of the most popular parks in Seville. During the city\''s Carnaval this park is a favorite meeting place. On Sunday mornings it is the setting for the popular <font color=\"#000000\"><span>Mercadillo de la Alameda</span></font> where you can buy almost anything.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Exposition of 29 Site</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the 1920s, Seville experienced a cultural renaissance that has been called Regionalismo, because it coincided with the rise of Andalusian patriotism championed by Blas Infante. At this time the Iberoamerican Exposition of 1929 was held, and many beautiful buildings were built in a lovely spot in Seville to mark the occasion. The nerve centre was the Parque de María Luisa (Maria Louisa Park).  Between the city center and these buildings from the beginning of the 20th century there are beautiful buildings like the Palacio de San Telmo (San Telmo Palace), the headquarters of the Universidad Hispalense (Seville University, formerly a tobacco factory), the luxurious Hotel Alfonso XIII, and a few meters away the Casino de la Exposición and the Teatro Lope de Vega.  In the Parque de María Luisa are the Plaza de España and the Plaza de América, as well as many pavilions built for the Exposition of 29. Among these are the Royal Pavilion, and the pavilions of Mudejar, Domecq, México, Chile and Uruguay (the two latter are now the head offices of public institutions).  There are other Latin American pavilions along the Paseo de las Delicias and the Avenida de la Palmera, including those of Guatemala and Cuba. The latter is one of the most beautiful, and is the current headquarters for the Delegación del Gobierno de la Junta de Andalucía (Andalusia Autonomous Government Headquarters).</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Triana</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Triana is located on the other bank of the Guadalquivir River. It is joined to Seville by several bridges, including that of Isabel II also known as the Puente de Triana.Triana has traditionally been a fishing district. It was once the site of the Reales Almonas, a factory that produced the most famous soap in the world. Pottery making has also historically been an important resource of this area.  There are plenty of famous streets in Triana, among them San Jacinto, Betis, Pureza and Castilla. Triana is a district that is thought of independently from Seville, in fact the locals refer to Triana and Seville separately, as if they were two different cities.  Churches and chapels abound in Triana. It even has its own cathedral, the Iglesia de Santa Ana. There is also a great tradition of religious guilds, such as the brotherhoods of Semana Santa (Easter) like La Estrella, San Gonzalo, la Esperanza de Triana, El Cachorro and La O.  This traditional area has many bars where you can try pescaíto frito (small, deep-fried fish), such as in the Kiosco de las Flores, one of Seville\''s most characteristic restaurants.  Triana\''s atmosphere is more reminiscent of Seville in the 1930s and 1940s, than of today\''s overcrowded cities.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Island of la Cartuja</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the end of the 1980s, the Isla de la Cartuja was practically virgin territory containing only the Monasterio de Santa María de las Cuevas (monastery), casa de Cartujos (house), and the old ceramics factory of the Marquis of Pickman.  The site was transformed by the Exposition of 1992. Roads and buildings were constructed, and the Island of la Cartuja became one of the most modern areas of Seville, much sought after by companies wishing to see up offices here. The extra-modern Escuela Superior de Ingenieros de la Universidad Hispalense (Engineering School of Seville University) and some private faculties are located here.  It is a spacious and well-lit place, although an inconvenience is that it is so spread out that it is not easy to walk from place to place.  Several attractions are located on the Island of la Cartuja. Among them are the fairground Isla Mágica (Magic Island), and the Estadio Olímpico de Sevilla.  Some of the city\''s most important art exhibitions take place in the monastery of Santa Maria de las Cuevas, such as that which commemorated the 400th anniversary of the birth of Velázquez.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1916,'<div class=\"OverviewText\">A major economic hub situated on the Yangtze River Delta, Shanghai is a fascinating symbol of prosperity and modernity. Shanghai\''s relatively small city center makes it easy to navigate. It consists of two basic districts, Pu Xi (western town) and Pu Dong (eastern town), facing one another across the Huang Pu River. As a general rule, Pu Xi embodies \"Old Shanghai\" and Pu Dong represents \"New Shanghai.\" Excellent examples of this dichotomy are characterized in the architecture, with the early 20th century facades of the Bund on the Pu Xi side such as the Peace Hotel and the conspicuously modern architecture of the Oriental Pearl TV Tower and the Grand Hyatt Shanghai on the Pu Dong side.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Shanghai and its immediate environs support several local artists. Many artists from other parts of the country also come here to exhibit their work in one of its many galleries. The decade-old ShangART in Xintiandi often exhibits avant-garde works by Chinese artists, while the ArtSPACE features experimental works in Jing\''an\''s M50 Art District. Shanghai also supports a burgeoning contemporary art scene, represented in a slew of modern galleries that have sprung up in the last few years, including the M97 Gallery, the much-acclaimed Rockbund ART Museum, and the Art Labor Gallery that is nestled in the Former French Concession neighborhood.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shanghai\''s many large movie theaters screen a wide variety of films, from Hollywood blockbusters to Chinese epics. Also, various organizations show movies that do not get as much press with English or Chinese subtitles. The Cine Club de l\''alliance shows French films with Chinese subtitles. For Hollywood blockbusters and the latest Chinese films, look into the Peace Cinema near People\''s Square, or the Broadband International Cineplex. The Shanghai Film Art Center also has a good selection, and plays host to the annual Shanghai International Film Festival.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dance and Musical Performances</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Several of the city\''s venues showcase dance performances. The Shanghai Grand Theater, a first-class international standard theater, often hosts international acts, while the Shanghai Stadium, Majestic Theater and Grand Theater at People\''s Square also provide sites for cultural performances both big and small. Less formally, Jing An Chamber Music offers weekly chamber music concerts every Sunday evening at the Jing An Hotel. The Shanghai Concert Hall, originally founded in 1930 as the Nanking Theatre, is the city\''s longstanding fixture for brilliant classical concerts. The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra is known to play at the dazzling Symphony Hall in the Xuhui district, a 1200-seat venue designed by a Japanese architect-duo. The Lincoln Center Shanghai also hosts seasonal jazz performances. The Shanghai live music scene is also well developed, with plenty of big and small venues offering a variety of styles of music. Most bars along Mao Ming Nan Lu host rock cover bands Friday and Saturday nights. For an underground live music scene on the weekend, look no further than Yuyintang, one of the city\''s most notable fixtures for rock gigs.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Shanghai Art Museum, located at People\''s Square, is the most visited museum in Shanghai. Designed to look like an ancient Chinese vessel, the museum\''s modern exterior stands out as a showpiece. The museum features superbly displayed, first-class exhibits of ancient Chinese artifacts and archaeological finds with Chinese and English explanations. The scientifically inclined may enjoy the Natural History Museum, which features a curious assortment of dinosaur bones and pickled human remains. While you are at People\''s Square, check out the Urban Planning Exhibition Hall for a miniature model of the city\''s design plan for the 2010 World Exhibition. Well worth a visit, especially for those who appreciate history, is the Museum of Public Security. This incredibly frank, thorough, world class museum rivals the Shanghai History Museum in the Oriental Pearl Tower for its number of historical artifacts and creative curating. Also a hit, especially if you are traveling with youngsters, is the Shanghai Ocean Aquarium in Pudong.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Opera</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The acrobatics, bright costumes and high pitched vocals of Chinese traditional opera are truly part of the Chinese cultural experience. First time patrons are recommended to prepare themselves before giving it a go, as it is a highly stylized artform full of symbolism that will not be readily apparent to the uninitiated. It is recommended to read up on traditional opera, pack an open mind, and make sure you see a performance with English subtitles to ensure a pleasant experience. Venues to try for Chinese opera include the Yi Fu Theater or the fabulous and historic Great World Entertainment Center. The Bandai Namco Dream Hall also hosts a plethora of traditional Chinese operas from time to time.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Shanghai Grand Theater and the Shanghai Theater Academy offer modern dramatic theater. One of the breath taking traditional Chinese performance art forms is acrobatics. An added bonus to enjoying an acrobatics show is the lack of a language barrier, so anyone can fully enjoy a show. The Shanghai Acrobatics Troupe is one of the city\''s most celebrated performance troupes. Acrobatics shows can be found at the Great World Entertainment Center and Shanghai Grand Theater. Another place to enjoy smaller productions is the People\''s Art Theater.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife and Discos</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shanghai\''s nightlife is so developed that there are endless options for a fun night out, but some places stand out as great for dancing. The theatrical Bar Rouge on the Bund and Zapatas, specializing in fishbowl margaritas, are all highly recommended for their dance floors. Promoting a robust underground club scene for more than five years is Arkham, while Dada, a local dive is known for its hypnotic blend of DJs and youthful expats who take over the dance floor on Fridays and Saturdays.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

In a plan to elevate Shanghai to the level of a major Asian commercial center, the Chinese government created the Pudong New Area Open Economic Development Zone, with a fast rising skyline and loads of investment money. After 1992 the rapid economic development of the area changed the demographics of Pu Dong, creating a growing cosmopolitan flavor with a more modern and technical sophistication than the older, traditional heart of the city in Pu Xi.  Chiefly a financial district but also a growing community, Pu Dong offers increasingly more to do and see east of the Huangpu River. The shops and eateries along Century Boulevard, a 21st Century main street to match the ultra-modern skyscrapers and business culture, was designed with the 2010 Shanghai World Expo in mind. The Oriental Pearl TV Tower, one of the largest tower in Asia and symbol of Shanghai\''s prosperity, is an integral part of Shanghai\''s skyline. The tower houses the Shanghai History Museum and an observation deck open to the public. Nearby Jin Mao Tower caps the Pearl\''s view and is free to the public.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pu Xi</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pu Xi is a warren of city districts that together make up the cosmopolitan flavor of Shanghai. Unlike Beijing\''s city center, which emanates from the Forbidden City in outward rings, Shanghai\''s districts each offer a different flavor and diffuse the \"center\" of the city into well connected neighborhoods: densely populated Huangpu; historic French Concession, which spans the Luwan and Xuhui districts; park-like Changning district; expat-friendly Jing\''an district; crowded Putuo district; Zhabei district, home to the Shanghai Railway Station; Hongkou district, where 20th Century writer Lu Xun made his home; and Yangpu district, home to Shanghai\''s distinguished Fudan and Tongji Universities. Most of the places of interest to the traveler are in Huangpu and Luwan districts, and the grid-like city plan makes it easy to find your way around Shanghai. The city has areas that range from the traditionally Chinese Yu Yuan Gardens to the modern urban bustle of Huai Hai Road. The following areas of Pu Xi and should not be missed.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Huangpu</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Huangpu District houses several of the top sites of Shanghai, including the Bund, Nan Shi, Nanjing Road, and People\''s Square, where the incredible Shanghai Museum sits.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Bund</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Definitely one of Shanghai\''s major highlights, the Bund offers an impressive showcase of Shanghai\''s colonial past. Beautifully preserved Art Deco and neoclassical buildings line the waterfront that faces the developing Pu Dong skyline. In the early morning one can join in on Tai Chi practice. In the evening one can stroll along the water to watch the skyline light up with the night. For a taste of nostalgia, visit the Peace Hotel. Once Shanghai\''s premier hotel, it was <em>the</em> place to stay during Shanghai\''s colonial heyday.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nan Jing Road</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shanghai\''s historical shopping street became an exclusive pedestrian thoroughfare in 2000. On the western side stands the massive Shanghai Center, a multi-complex that houses the Portman Ritz-Carlton Hotel, commercial businesses, consulates, a shopping mall and Shanghai Center Theater. The open area of the walking street gives it a carnival atmosphere. At night the shops create a neon frenzy of color and glitter that has a long and famous tradition. Nan Jing Road is 6 km (3.7 miles) from east to west, starting at the Bund and ending at People\''s Park. It has the reputation for being the busiest shopping street in the world, catering to over 1 million visitors a day.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nan Shi</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Set in the district that was formerly the Chinese-governed Old City outside colonial jurisdiction, Yu Yuan Gardens is a traditional <em>Jiang Nan</em> (south of the river) style garden. A popular destination every day of the week, it offers a rare visit to peace and tranquility from an older time to balance the quick pulse of most of the Shanghai experience.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">People\''s Square</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In colonial days, the People\''s Square Park was a horse racing track. After 1949 when gambling was banned it became a public square and parade ground. With the rapid development of the 1990s, People\''s Square became the residence of Shanghai City Hall. The Shanghai Museum now stands where the race track clubhouse once stood. The Shanghai Grand Theater also lines the square, as does the JW Marriot Shanghai.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Jing An District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Jing An is a popular residential district for the city\''s large expat community. Western-oriented shops full of curios are in ample supply. Jing An is also a popular leisure district and as such the fitting home of the historic Great World Entertainment Center, featuring acrobatics and Peking opera, among other amusements. If you find you need someplace to relax and mediate after all the stimulation that Shanghai offers, head to the Jing An Temple, a reconstructed structure sitting on an ancient site (first erected in 247 CE). This temple complex soothes the soul amidst the energetic and sometimes overwhelming frenzy of the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Old French Concession Area</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The French Concession was where French law prevailed before the revolution. It was here that the Communist Party of China was started in 1921 and revolutionaries found refuge from the local Chinese police. The <em>shikumen</em> townhouses, architecture unique to Shanghai, have been preserved, several sport plaques detailing their long lives. The tumultuous history of the French Concession can be explored at Dr. Sun Yat-sen\''s Former Residence & Memorial Hall. Beautifully preserved, his home furnishes a place for visitors to walk the grounds. Now, the French Concession is no longer a hotbed of political activity but a charming shopping district, with super stylish boutiques found along tree-lined streets, especially Changle Lu and Xinle Lu and throughout Xintiandi. Huai Hai Road is by far one of the most popular shopping districts in Shanghai. It is a bit cheaper than Nanjing Road, less crowded, and has more of an emphasis on European fashion.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (1926,'<div class=\"OverviewText\">Siena, like many ancient Italian cities, lives up to the title <em>luogo a misura d\''uomo</em> or \"a place made for people\". This is partly due to its compact size, which allows visitors to stroll leisurely about the city, and also due to the quantity and quality of the services that the town offers. There are good urban transport facilities here, as well as a large number of garages. Private cars have limited access inside the city walls, both because of the restricted amount of space and the complex street layout, and this allows drivers to leave their cars at the gates of the city while they enjoy themselves in the center. Even the banking services, such as the currency conversion services and general tourist assistance are top quality. It would be difficult to get away with anything less than great service here, as after all, this is the home of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the world\''s oldest banking establishment, founded in 1472. The hotels and the restaurants here are extremely welcoming and still maintain the original spirit of the city. This helps to promote a wonderful sense of camaraderie between guests and locals, and visitors who are made to feel welcome leave with an increased respect for this friendly city. People generally flock to Siena for three reasons: art, architecture, and the Palio, the annual horse race in which the different districts of Siena compete. There is enough art here to keep even the most seasoned critic occupied, with sites like the Duomo, and the Pinacoteca Nazionale (National Art Gallery) The experience of visiting the birthplace of major works of art offers a continuous feast for the eyes and brings joy to the soul.One cannot forget about the Palio, which takes place at the large central square, the Piazza del Campo. On July 2 and August 16 (the more exciting date), the city goes back in time to revisit the old alliances and feuds between the districts of Siena. There are 17 <em>contrade</em>, (districts) in Siena, all of which have their own underground tricks or games which they harbor secretly for a year (and sometimes more). Since only ten districts can compete each year, the competition to be a part of the race is almost as important as the actual event! The Palio is more than just a race for the horses and their riders; it is also a matter of pride and ego for thousands of Senesi. The competition is fierce, with each neighborhood decked out in its colors (woe be to the unsuspecting tourist who proclaims his alliance in the wrong district of town), and if a jockey sells out to a rival team, he had better flee before his old supporters fully catch on. In the end, it comes down to traditional athletic competition, only one that started at the beginning of the last millennium, in 1147. Around this time, similar plots and schemes were being hatched in other cities, but none have maintained the popular appeal of Palio. One thing is certain - no one can claim to have properly experienced Siena without having seen it for themselves.Of the Original 59 districts or <em>contrade</em>, only 17 survive to this day. Below are a brief summary of these historic neighborhoods that have survived since the medieval ages. Each is like a state that has a certain level of autonomy and manages its own administration, museums, and public events. There are four noble districts or <em>nobile contrade </em>that have earned their title for acts of valor during historic campaigns and military victories.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (1933,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art and Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sienna is a cultural powerhouse, and each district or <em>contrada</em> has its own museum. Among the top choices, the historic hospital-turned-museum, Complesso Museale Santa Maria della Scala displays an excellent array of artworks across genres from fine painting to sculpture and medieval artifacts. Another important museum where visitors can explore the city\''s intriguing artistic development is the  Palazzo Pubblico and Museo Civico, whose frescoes are some of the most beautiful and well preserved in the country. Salvaged architectural sections of the gorgeous Duomo and its artworks are displayed at the Museo dell\''opera Metropolitana while the Museo della Tortura is perfect for visitors with a morbid streak.  <div class=\"listing_callout\"></div></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Siena\''s pubs and bars are largely focused in the center of town. The <em>osterie</em>, or inns, offer a chance for guests to sample some of the area\''s great wines. Here you can recapture some of the old flavors of the city, and has become an activity that is being rediscovered by young people. This is not an incentive for heavy drinking, but a way to enjoy a good wine as it should be served—accompanied by a snack. One of the most popular <em>osterie</em> in the city is the Antica Osteria da Divo that\''s worth a visit for a traditional meal amidst ancient caves. There is also the opportunity to learn about winemaking techniques, and how different wines are made using these traditional methods. For anyone who feels like a beer, there are a number of English and Irish-style pubs like La Diana that are open until late at night—though this is in comparison to other places in Siena, not to bars in other towns such as Rimini, where a closing time of 3a is more likely to be the norm.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music & Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Of course, drinking and dancing aren\''t the only ways to spend an evening in Siena. There is also a large choice of cultural activities to keep you from idleness. The university organizes an annual \"Parole e Musica\" (Words and Music) program, which covers dramatic arts and offers good, inexpensive shows. There are also all the traditional entertainments, with cinemas and theaters that have excellent seasons throughout the winter, such as the Teatro dei Rinnovati and the Teatro dei Rozzi. There are also classical music concerts in winter, organized by the Accademia Chigiana, which take place in the halls of the Palazzo Chigi Saracini. Students on a budget need not fear, as there are a variety of discounts to be found. Siena has also become known as a jazz center, as it holds a variety of concerts between the end of July and the first week in August and which feature a host of famous names. In addition, Siena has become renowned for the study of jazz theory that takes place here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wine Tasting and Wineries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Siena, in the heart of the Tuscan wine region, is a perfect place for oenophiles. The undulating hills around the historic city are home to lush vineyards that produce excellent Chianti and there are numerous wine tours and wine tasting organized by local companies and wine bars around the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Palio</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Palio is the summer\''s biggest event for residents of the city, and is also of great interest to visitors seeking a thrill. The people of the various districts of Siena follow their ritual of strategies, hopes, prayers, dramas, and more - all to win a horse race.

Let yourself be whisked back in time to 1819, when Sir Stamford Raffles first stepped ashore. Still exuding a strong air of a bygone era are well restored government buildings, cathedrals and churches, notably Singapore Cricket Club, once a heritage sports center. Esplanade Park makes for a pleasant stroll while learning about the martyrs and heroes, in honor of whom the various memorials in the park have been built. Impressive government buildings like The Arts House, Singapore\''s former Parliament Building stand as sentinels of a historic time.  <br><br>\r\nThe city\''s finest museums also lie nestled in and around the district including the Singapore Art Museum, Asian Civilisations Museum, Singapore Philatelic Museum and Singapore History Museum.

Other dining and entertainment attractions along the river include the Riverside Point, Riverside Village and Robertson Quay at the uppermost end.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Financial District</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is home to the towering skyscrapers that lend Singapore its distinctive skyline. Over the years, building after building has battled to be the tallest, among which are included the UOB Building, One Raffles Place, Republic Plaza and the Guoco Tower. At one end near the Singapore River is The Fullerton Hotel, a hotel built in neoclassical architecture that once dominated the district. Further south is Clifford Pier, built in 1931 and is today the embarkation point for cruises to neighboring islands. Another part of old Singapore is the Lau Pa Sat, a complete reconstruction of the first municipal market of 1894 that has been transformed into a thriving food center—the perfect venue for relishing Asian cuisines at budget-friendly prices.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Orchard Road</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shop till you drop! Join the jostling crowds and do what Singaporeans do best—shop, catwalk and flaunt their chic style. Swanky malls and charming boutiques dot Singapore\''s prime shopping belt from end to end, while trendy alfresco eateries make great spots for watching the fashion parade go by. Top stops include local department stores Robinsons and TANGS (which is a landmark in itself with the distinctive pagoda-roofed tower of the Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza Hotel just above it), and mammoth shopping arcade Ngee Ann City for its posh boutiques and the anchor tenant, Takashimaya. During Christmas, Orchard Road is always a colorful spectacle of bright lights and exuberant decorations.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chinatown</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Despite having been redeveloped in the past, this ethnic enclave still holds pockets of time-worn buildings where Singaporeans continue to practice age-old trades. Others have been restored to their former state, like the series of shophouses at the Tanjong Pagar Conservation Area. For an authentic taste of Chinese culture, try visiting a teahouse, then take a peek into a typical middle-class Chinese home in the 1920s at the Chinaman Scholar\''s Gallery. Crowded streets throb with people, especially just before Chinese New Year, when Chinese opera and lion dances add to the festivity. Do not forget to visit the eclectic mix of mosques and temples while you are here—the serene Nagore Dargha Shrine, the elaborate Sri Mariamman Temple and the grand Thian Hock Keng Temple are just a few. You will be delighted to find that this is perhaps the only neighborhood in the city where places of worship of several religions stand harmoniously next to each other along the same street.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kampong Glam</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">With its top draw being the Sultan Mosque, this is the repository of culture for Singapore\''s Malay community. Visitors can stop by the Malay Heritage Centre at the Istana Kampong Glam and take a stroll around Singapore\''s oldest Malay cemetery. Shopping here is a refreshing change from the glitzy malls of Orchard Road, with stores selling everything from Malay, Indonesian and Middle Eastern merchandise to trendy one-of-a-kind boutiques.

Awash with scents and sights that transport you to India, this is where everything needed by an Indian household is found. Traces of Hinduism are seen everywhere, from the embellished Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple to pictures of Hindu deities. Mustafa Centre sells just about anything you need under one roof and is a haven for bargain hunters.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sentosa</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sentosa promises an enjoyable time for all ages. This island dubbed \''the State of Fun,\'' is a short 15-minute ride from the city center and is accessible via public transport.

 (1963,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This area offers most visitors their first impression of the city, greeting them with its signature Gateway Arch, historic Union Station, the Old Courthouse and Busch Stadium, where the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team plays their home games. The once industrial area of Laclede\''s Landing is now home to some of the city\''s favorite restaurants and finest hotels, as well as an entertainment district that features live music ranging from pop to jazz. This is the heart of the city, sprawled along the banks of the Mississipi River, alongside the state border between Missouri and Illinois. To the west lies the aptly named neighborhood of Downtown West, centered around the Union Station. This is where you will find the acclaimed Scottrade Center, the Peabody Opera House and the City Museum. The castle-like Union Station Hotel is one of the area\''s most recognizable landmarks.Head west along the Interstate Highway 64 to reach Midtown, home of the Saint Louis University and the Harris-Stowe State University.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Soulard</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This old, well-established neighborhood is situated south of Downtown.

It is the largest continually operating open-air market west of the Mississippi River. Visitors will also find the Anheuser-Busch Brewery in this area.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lafayette Square</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The largely restored Lafayette Square neighborhood has nearly 400 Victorian-era homes, along with many charming restaurants and bed and breakfasts. The neighborhood circles the 30-acre Lafayette Park, the first public park to be established west of the Mississippi River. This verdant oasis often hosts outdoor concerts. film screenings and baseball matches. Though still in the middle of a major urban center, you\''ll feel like you\''re in a small town here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Grand and Dutchtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A large Asian community resides in the South Grand area, offering a tantalizing selection of Asian restaurants on nearly every block. This neighborhood also contains Tower Grove Park and the expansive Missouri Botanical Gardens. Further south lies Dutchtown. This characterful neighborhood was once a thriving German-American settlement and is the site of the German Cultural Society. It was also here that German-American organizations like the Concordia Seminary, the Concordia Publishing House and the Lutheran Hospital were established. The neighborhood takes its name from the word \"Deutsch\" for German.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Hill</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Settled by Italian immigrants in the late 1800s, this area still offers some of the best traditional Italian fare this side of the Atlantic. Gian-Peppe\''s and Dominic\''s are highly recommended by the locals for those in search of fine Italian dining. Pride runs deep in this old neighborhood with well-tended lawns, where even the fireplugs sport the red, green and white of the Italian flag. The St. Louis Art Museum and the St. Louis Science Center can also be found in this district.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Central West End</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The heart of the Central West End is Forest Park, which is larger than Central Park in New York City and is home to several free attractions, including the St. Louis Zoo.

 (1981,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theaters</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Stockholm\''s theatrical community is characterized by three main sections: state-subsidised theaters, privately operated theaters, and independent theater companies. The state-subsidised theaters typically have a large and varied selection of classics, dramas, comedies, and children\''s theatre on offer. The Stockholm City Theater, housed in the enormous Cultural Center at Sergels Torg, is a prime example of this with its seven stages. There are performances here from early morning until late at night, catering to all tastes and ages. The best place to catch celebrities is probably the Royal Dramatic Theater at Nybroplan, however. Ingmar Bergman left an indelible mark on this theatrical institution, and while The Stockholm City Theatre is more modern and populist, The Royal Dramatic Theatre offers an exclusive atmosphere and royal boxes.Privately operated theatres have higher ticket prices, lots of chartered buses coming in from all over Sweden, and a repertoire of musicals and farces. The beautiful Oscarsteatern with its long theatrical history, has been at the centre of much controversy lately because of acrimonious disputes over changes of ownership, but the theater and the productions are generally magnificent and lavish, with strong casts and award-winning productions. The latter is equally true of Chinateatern at Berzelii Park and Cirkus on Djurgården. Intiman and Maxim are sure bets if you are in the mood for a farce, and Göta Lejon has also staged productions worth seeing over the years.Independent theatre companies typically offer rather reasonable ticket prices and are often home to a more experimental staging by young, hot directors and actors. Among the better known companies are Teater Galeasen and Teater Plaza, where names like Thorsten Flinck, Mikael Persbrandt, Simon Norrthon, and Stefan Larsson often appear on the programs.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Operas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Stockholm opera scene is dominated by two stages: the Royal Opera and the Folkopera. The same comparison applies here as between The Royal Dramatic Theatre and The Stockholm City Theatre. The Royal Opera is fancy and fairly traditional whereas The Folkopera is younger, fresher, and more modern. The great divas appear at The Royal Opera, and the upcoming opera stars of tomorrow at The Folkopera. Both are well worth a visit.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinemas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you prefer cinematic Hollywood entertainment, downtown Stockholm has a lot to offer. Along the route from Hötorget to Stureplan, you will find Filmstaden Sergel, Saga, and Rigoletto practically next door to one another. On Sveavägen, there is the Grand, and in Söder, you\''ll find the offerings of Filmstaden Söder, Biopalatset, and Victoria. The suburbs also have their fair share of Hollywood blockbuster cinemas, of course. For those who prefer a more original cinematic repertoire, one place to go is Zita on Birger Jarlsgatan. Sture also has a great deal to offer to those who have had enough of American box office hits. The non-Swedish-speaking visitor will be pleased to hear that foreign films in Sweden are shown in the original language with Swedish subtitles. The one exception to this is in children\''s movies, which are usually dubbed into Swedish. Even with children\''s movies, however, you may find that there are two versions available, subtitled or dubbed. This is especially likely with the major Disney movies, and it could be well worth your while to check with the box office.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Stockholm has a lot to offer to those in the mood for more cultural exposure. Djurgården is an excellent first stop. The dramatic reconstruction of the war ship Vasa, which sank in the Stockholm harbour on its maiden voyage, is a truly impressive sight at Vasamuséet, a highly recommended attraction for visitors of all ages. Close by is the magnificent Nordiska Muséet, which has been mistaken by many a visitor for a royal palace with all its towers and spires. Waldemarsudde is a must for art lovers, and the Museum of Maritime History is a boat lover\''s dream. Skansen is not just a zoological park but also a reserve for historic architecture and crafts. Visitors to Stockholm should definitely put several hours aside for all the wonderful sights here. Next to Skansen is the Biological Museum, which specializes in displays taxidermy animals in their natural habitats.If you are the least bit interested in history, a visit to the Museum of Medieval History is an experience you will not soon forget. There, you can learn all about the history of Stockholm through the centuries of the Middle Ages, and the displays are usually of very high quality. The Swedish Museum of Natural History is a bit off the beaten track out by The University of Stockholm, but it is well worth the effort of taking a bus or the metro to see all the fantastic exhibits and installations. While here, don\''t miss out on the omniplex films where you can learn more about the cosmos or the Egypt of Pharaohs. Fans of sculpture should definitely make a point of visiting the amazing Millesgården. Färgfabriken by Liljeholmen also has a lot to offer, in both sculpture and modern art. In the latter category, a visit to the Museum of Modern Art is another obvious choice.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Concert Hall at Hötorget offers a sterling repertoire of classical music. Berwaldhallen, home to The Swedish Radio Symphony, is also highly recommended with its unique acoustic design of beautiful natural wood. For jazz and blues lovers, Fasching and Stampen are the top choices, but many of Stockholm\''s bars and pubs offer musical entertainment of their own in this genre, especially on weekends. The major pop and rock concerts are usually held at the Ericsson Globe Arena, Cirkus, the stadium, or the concert hall.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Stockholm\''s undisputed nightlife hub is the area between Kungsträdgården and Stureplan. This is where you\''ll find the hottest clubs and bars. In Kungsträdgården, Café Opera is the ultimate nightlife attraction, but Victoria is also very popular. If you prefer local pub life, Söder is the place to go. Söders Hjärta is a safe bet. Vasastan also has a number of good pubs and bars, such as Cliff Barnes and Storstad. Or why not explore the huge selection of whiskeys and genuine British pub atmosphere of the little known but very congenial Bishop\''s Arms on St. Eriksgatan. Stockholm is a fun loving city with more than enough nightlife to keep any visitor entertained.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1982,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Norrmalm (City)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Stockholm wears many beautiful faces, and each area of the city is delightfully distinctive. Centralen, for example, is a typical downtown area with traffic jams and bustling crowds. Take the subway a couple stations and spot modern, daring architecture, such as the City Library a few blocks north of the Rådmansgatan subway station and the Cultural Centre at T-Centralen. Go through Kungsträdgården, The King\''s Garden, and walk over the bridge to cozy little Skeppsholmen, popping into Moderna Museet or Skeppsholmen\''s church. You can even take a ferry out to the magical archipelago and you will still be, geographically at least, within the borders of Stockholm.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Östermalm & Djurgården</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Östermalm is the most elegant part of town and where some of the city\''s most impressive buildings are found. Notably, Östermalms Saluhall should not be missed! You can also head alongside the water and over the bridge to Djurgården, a lovely island ideal for walks and picnics, and visit Skansen or the famous Gröna Lund amusement park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Södermalm</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The south side of town, Södermalm, is also worth seeing. In the late 1800s, this area was home to Stockholm\''s working class. Returning home from long, hard days by the ships, workers used to stop for drinks at the area\''s local taverns. This image of Södermalm as the home of the bohemian workers, of genuine pub culture and socializing has been preserved. In fact, more cafés, galleries and pubs are found here than in any other part of town. A lot of small, funky stores featuring local artists\'' and designers\'' works are also to be found in this area, as well as at the summer Mynttorget street-festivals. At Vita Bergen, you canenjoy performances both in theater and song. Overall, it is here in Södermalm that you will experience a creative, urban Stockholm.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Gamla Stan (The Old Town)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If Södermalm is cultural Stockholm, then Gamla Stan is genuine Stockholm. It is still the city\''s pride and joy. Cobbled streets and narrow, 17th-century alleys—the smallest one being just over 26 inches wide— create a unique atmosphere here. Don\''t forget to look up at the impressive old church, Storkyrkan, while exploring. The area\''s old houses all feature ambitious decor and ornaments. If you turned back the clock by about 700 years this is what all of Stockholm would look like. A lot has happened since, one example being the construction of the Royal Castle. Unfortunately, members of the royal family no longer live here, and Drottningholm now serves as their home. Stroll through the lovely gardens, admire the water, and appreciate the history of the diverse Swedish capital from its unmissable Old Town.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

If opera or ballet is your thing, spend a night under the gorgeous ceiling fresco in the majestic Opera House. If you prefer live theater, there are numerous small independent companies, or try the Altes Schauspielhaus, opened in 1909, Drei Groschentheater, a small theater showing mostly 20th-century plays, or Thtr Rmpe, which focuses exclusively on plays by young German playwrights.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\''re interested in cinema, look to the Delphi and Atelier for top European productions. English speaking guests may be happy to learn that Corso shows Hollywood films in English.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cabaret & Musicals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For lively cabaret, you can\''t beat the Renitenz, with its political satire or the humorous Theater der Altstadt. The list goes on, of course, with most everything people do on stages to be found somewhere in the city, even first rate puppetry at FITS - Figurentheater. Another venue that promises excellent entertainment is the SI-Centrum, hosting acclaimed musicals.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Clubs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you like the nightlife, after dark in Stuttgart can be loud and long. The clubs have a good mix of modern music and are a great way to mingle with locals. A mainstay in Stuttgart discos is House and Hip Hop music; if that\''s your thing, check out ClimaX Institutes, Perkins Park, or ProTon for a lively night out. Stuttgart clubs run from small to huge, and several offer two, three, or even four separate dance floors to accommodate a range of musical tastes. Kings Club is popular on the LGBTQ scene. To round it out, check out Toy for techno beats.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (1992,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">City Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city is situated in a valley which is open on one side. From the center of town, one is surrounded by picturesque vineyards and slopes in almost every direction. Due to its unique topographical site, the city has a distinctly southern flair. Green parks spread from Neues Schloss to Höhenpark Killesberg. You will seldom find gardens of this size in other large cities, although there are also a great deal of pedestrian walkways for visitors to explore. Königstraße is the main shopping street, but Calwer Straße, with houses dating from between the 17th and 20th Centuries, is an elegant and historically interesting location. The beautiful Altes Schloss and Neus Schloss are situated side by side in the city center, and the Schlossplatz, Schillerplatz and Markthalle are only some of the attractions you will pass whilst just strolling around the center. Cafeterias, restaurants and snack bars are on almost every corner. Those on the search for drink and history will appreciate Calwer-Eck-Brau (Stuttgart\''s first local brewery), located on Calwer Straße. Here, the beer on tap is always brewed on-site.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bohnenviertel</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This district gets its name from the bean gardens that once grew in the area. At one time, beans formed the staple diet of the lower classes, so there are many stories and tales about these beans and their uses. Around the end of the 19th Century, these gardens were developed into real estate, but the area retained the same name. It is the most distinctive district, with plenty of wine taverns and pubs. Bohnenviertel\''s residents know and love Stuttgart, and the district is packed full of insiders who are experts on the city. The shops in this area also fit the town\''s character; they are original and really quite extraordinary.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bad Cannstatt</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bad Cannstatt is Stuttgart\''s biggest and oldest suburb. Thanks to its rich supply of mineral water, it used to be a world-famous spa where kings and emperors met. Even today, it is a very attractive district with a long and interesting history, good shops, spas of course, and a great deal to offer those seeking ways to spend their leisure time. It is the home of the Wilhelma, a zoo and botanical garden, as well as the boarding point for boat rides down the Neckar. By the way, if you ask the locals where they come from, the answer will always be \"Bad Cannstatt\" and never \"Stuttgart.\"</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Degerloch</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A favorite residential area, the name of this district comes from <em>teger</em> and <em>lohe</em>, which means \"thick forest.\" There are many beautiful paths for walks, and more than a handful of sports facilities, especially in the woods around the Fernsehturm. If you are keen on trying an alternative way of reaching Degerloch, you should take a ride on the rack railway, the Zahnradbahn. It leaves from the center of trendy Marienplatz and ends up at Degerloch Station.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Möhringen</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just like Degerloch, this is a heavily residential area that is located south of the city. First documented in 1100 CE, Möhringen has a small town center, but became very famous due to the SI-Erlebnis-Centrum, which stages world famous musicals. Besides the many high-quality restaurants and bars, SI-Erlebnis-Centrum also hosts the Schwaben-Quellen, a spa complex, and Spielbank Stuttgart, a casino.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Killesberg</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Stuttgart\''s most noble and elegant district, it is here that one can find villas with a truly stunning view of the city. From the viewing tower in Höhenpark Killesberg, visitors can gaze upon the vineyards, which wind down to the city center and then connect to the parks in the downtown area. A very exclusive and quiet residential district, many prominent citizens of the past and present have flocked to live here. In fact, Theodor Heuss, the first president of the Federal Republic of Germany, and the Porsche family have called Killesberg home. It goes without saying that the prices for renting or buying property in the area are sky high. The Theodor-Heuss-Haus and Weissenhof Estate are attractions that should be on every visitor\''s list.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rotenberg</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the oldest wine-producing communities in the Neckar area, Rotenberg still has its own authentic, charming character. From here, you have a glorious view of the surrounding vineyards and the neighboring village of Uhlbach. Those who love nature and have a strong interest in wine will be thrilled by the information boards posted along the walking paths, which offer details about the wines of the region. Further area highlights are Grabkapelle and Weinbaumuseum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Untertürkheim</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This area is located in the eastern part of the city and was first documented in 1100 CE as Durinkheim. Originally wine-making country, Daimler Motor Company started to build the first motorcars here in 1904, making Untertürkheim famous. The Mercedes Benz Museum is absolutely worth a trip, even if you are not a \"car person.\"</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Stuttgart-West</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The western part of town is the biggest one due to the fact that it accommodates the inner city. It was only in the period after 1870 that development on a massive scale began. Characteristic in this district are long, straight roads and lots of churches. Here you will find some wonderful, old buildings, lots of alternative pubs, and a young, urban scene.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Castle and Club Prana, on the other hand, are some of the city\''s most popular nightclubs while the Honey Pot tops the list of Tampa\''s gay bars. The Orpheum, Crowbar and New World Brewery are a few others stars of Tampa\''s booming nightlife.St. Petersburg is no less enticing by night, with its rooftop lounges, beach bars and glamorous nightclubs. From celebrity hotspots and speakeasies like the Mandarine Hide, to pubs like MacDinton\''s and the Ale & the Witch, St. Pete\''s has it all. Tryst Gastro Lounge is another popular choice, as is Shephard\''s Tiki Bar. For live music, head to Jannus, while Frenchy\''s Rockaway Grill is one of the city\''s favorite beach bars.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tampa Bay <em>loves</em> its sports. From the Tampa Bay Buccaneer football team to professional baseball and hockey teams, the city is high on sports and always has been—baseball legend, Babe Ruth, hit his longest home run here at Plant Field on April 4, 1919, when he whacked a 587-foot, record-setting homer. Another famous baseball name, Al Lopez, also known as \"El Senor,\" and named to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977, was a Ybor City native. Tampa Bay\''s Raymond James Stadium is a nationally acclaimed arena that frequently hosts the Super Bowl, while Tampa\''s Lightning hockey team plays at the Amalie Arena and enthusiastic fans closely follow Tampa Bay\''s Devil Rays baseball team. For racing enthusiasts, Tampa Bay has two greyhound racing tracks—Derby Lane in St. Petersburg, billed as the world\''s oldest continuously operating dog track, and Tampa Greyhound Track in Tampa. In nearby Oldsmar, Tampa Bay Downs thunders with the racing hooves of thoroughbred horses. Finally, for those who want a scenic walk or jog, Bayshore Boulevard runs alongside Tampa Bay for a serene 4.5 miles (7.2 kilometers) of panoramic views and greenery. A favorite with joggers, walkers, skaters and bikers, it\''s the city\''s epicenter for fitness fans and was cited by the American Automobile Association as one of the state\''s \"Top Roads.\" In St. Petersburg, the historic, mile-long pier is a delightful place to stroll the region\''s historic past, enjoy the present and contemplate the future.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For those who enjoy the outdoors, Tampa and St. Petersburg have much to offer. From sun-bronzed beaches and serene city parks to more thrilling fishing excursions and boat tours, these twin cities make the most of Tampa Bay\''s sunny climes. The best golf courses include Rock Point, Bay Palms, and Mangrove Bay & Cyprus Links.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When it comes to retail therapy or some good old window shopping, few can outdo Tampa and St. Petersburg\''s malls and shopping centers. Hyde Park Village, Channelside Bay Plaza, Centro YBOR and the Big Top Flea Market are the top choices in Tampa, while Ellenton Premium Outlets, Tyrone Square Mall, Baywalk, the 66th Street Flea Market and the Wagon Wheel Flea Marget are St. Petersburg\''s best.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

On the east side of the river, you will find a number of attractive hotels in the city\''s downtown core, such as the Tampa Marriott Waterside Hotel & Marina. Points of interest in this part of town include the Tampa Museum of Art, the Florida Aquarium and the Tampa Performing Arts Center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ybor City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the southern edge of downtown Tampa lies tiny Ybor City, the center of the cigar industry; cigarmakers moved here after a fire destroyed the industry in Key West. There are only 10 streets in either direction, but the area carries a wealth of history. Solid brick warehouses that once served as cigar factories now house offices and shops. Thanks to a strong restoration effort, Ybor City is the liveliest spot in town on weekends. Restaurants like the Columbia, dance clubs like Prana, cigar stores and specialty shops line Ybor City\''s narrow streets. Exhibits in the Ybor City Museum chronicle the city\''s colorful history.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Seminole Heights</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of Tampa\''s most quaint neighborhoods, Seminole Heights is a bohemian enclave that is home to an entreating variety of vintage shops, restored bungalows and established culinary gems serving gourmet eats. To the north of downtown Tampa, the neighborhood seems worlds apart from the frantic bustle of the city. The Second Sunday Morning Markets are a great place to get in touch with the community and shop for fresh produce while you\''re at it, while the Phoenix Glass Studio hosts live glass-blowing demonstrations. For a quick and delicious bite, head to the Taco Bus or slurp creamy ice-cream Bo\''s, a stalwart of Tampa\''s dining scene.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">SoHo/Hyde Park</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">SoHo is Tampa\''s contemporary, cosmopolitan neighborhood, favored by young professionals who live in the locale\''s stylish loft apartments. Nearby, Hyde Park is a green oasis with plenty of room for leisurely strolls and invigorating runs. At its core lies a babbling fountain surrounded by movie theaters, restaurants and boutiques that make for a lively after-work hangout infused with a hip, welcoming vibe.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Busch Gardens/University of South Florida</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A major north-south interstate highway, I-75, streaks up the east side of the bay, while I-275 branches off from I-75 north of Sarasota and travels through St. Petersburg, crossing the Howard Frankland and heading north from downtown. Those two interstate highways meet just north of town and create a triangle known as the Busch Gardens/University of South Florida region. This is where you will find Tampa\''s famed Busch Gardens. Other attractions in the vicinity include the Tampa Greyhound Track, the Museum of Science & Industry, Adventure Island water park and the D. G. Yuengling Brewery.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Tampa Airport/Westshore</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The award-winning Tampa International Airport sits on the city\''s west side, in the Airport/Westshore region. With a passenger volume of about 14 million annually, Tampa International Airport ranks among the top 10 airports in the nation for on-time departures. Here you will find some of the city\''s most impressive hotels, like the Embassy Suites Tampa, as well as the WestShore Plaza shopping area and the Raymond James Stadium.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Plant City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Traveling east of Tampa on I-4, built to connect Tampa to Daytona through Orlando, will bring you to Plant City, a farming community renowned for its annual Strawberry Festival and an array of related special events. There are also several interesting shops and restaurants here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown St. Petersburg</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown St. Petersburg is the heart of this city, across the bay from Tampa. The historic neighborhood is a hub of activity, a commercial and cultural center replete with restaurants, shops, parks, museums, waterfront promenades and so much more. This vibrant neighborhood is one of the urbanest in Tampa and hosts annual celebrations like the 4th of July fireworks with much pomp and show. Popular downtown attractions include the Salvador Dali Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Mahaffey Theatre, the Sunken Gardens and the Sundial St. Pete amongst several others.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Historic Kenwood</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just west of downtown St. Petersburg, Historic Kenwood is a menagerie of 1920s bungalows. In fact, the neighborhood is home to one of Florida\''s largest collections of this kind of architecture. Each year in November, the neighborhood hosts the BungalowFest, a two-day celebration of the neighborhood\''s heritage featuring guided tours of Historic Kenwood\''s beautifully preserved homes and gardens.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Tel Aviv Museum of Art, housed in a 1930s historic structure has a collection of art to thrill the most avid connoisseur. For a glimpse of the city\''s Jewish heritage, the Beit Hatfutsot is a top pick and tells the story of the Jewish people. Innovative design awaits curious visitors at the exceptional The Design Museum Holon while the Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art offers a look at modern Israeli art.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music and Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tel Aviv prides itself on being the cultural heartbeat of Israel. The municipality hosts a huge number of cultural events, many of them free, throughout the year. For the young at heart there is a DJ competition, where the five winners host a free outdoor rave for the city. For those who love celebrating there are outdoor carnivals such as the Love Parade and Gay Pride. For the classically oriented, the Israel Philharmonic gives a free summer concert in Hayarkon Park and opera performances are broadcast live to the masses on a giant screen in July and August.  There are all sorts of festivals, celebrating food, chocolate, Irish culture, Cuban culture, jazz, Afro-American music, percussion, children\''s tales and the list goes on. For Hebrew speakers, Ahba Ha\''ir (City Mouse) provides good listings of Tel Aviv events. English speakers should pick up a Friday edition of the Ha\''aretz/ Herald Tribune International, which contains <em>The Guide</em>—a listings magazine.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts and Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tel Aviv is where Israel\''s finest theatre, dance and music can be sampled. The Suzanne Dellal Centre in the historic Neve Tzedek neighborhood is a beautifully restored building (formerly a school) which is home to the Inbal and Bat Sheva dance troupes and an impressive dance venue.  The Habima is Israel\''s national theatre. The Habima group which began life in 1917 in Moscow, was the first Hebrew speaking theatre. Located next door is the state-of-the-art Heichal HaTarbut Concert Hall which houses the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.  The Cameri Theatre, located in the upstairs of a shopping precinct on Dizengoff Street, shows thought-provoking contemporary pieces, with a simultaneous translation into English on Tuesday nights. For film lovers, there is the Cinematheque—the first institution of its kind in Israel. There are film festivals, workshops, free foyer events and the screenings of dozens of films every month.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\''re going out at night in Tel Aviv, it\''s worth noting that most locals don\''t go out until close to midnight and most cafés stay open until the wee hours. Alcohol and pubs do not play a huge part in Israeli nightlife, instead the custom is to sit at an outdoor café until late, late, late.  On a summer\''s night on the Tayelet (beach promenade) the pavements are still thick with people at 3a. Many clubs keep on going until daylight.  You may encounter a doorman at the entrance to certain very image-conscious nightclubs. This is someone who looks the potential clientele up and down and decides who looks good enough to go in. Thankfully, the Knesset (Israeli parliament) passed a law in December 2000, outlawing discrimination on the part of nightclubs as to who can and cannot enter. Some of the livelier areas at night include the strip of Allenby Street near Carmel market, Sheinkin Street, Florentine and areas near the beach.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beachside Fun</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The beach is a sure source of entertainment in all seasons and at all hours. In summer, it is packed body to body with both tourists and locals. But, all year round the beach is great for both people watching and wave-watching, water sports and impromptu games of football and beach tennis, night picnics, romantic walks, jogging, and meditating.  On Friday nights, the alternative population of Tel Aviv gathers on Chinky Beach to drum in the sunset. Normally the crowd includes a few didgeridoo players and fire jugglers.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Gay Bars</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tel Aviv\''s live and let-live attitude has led to the flourishing of a lively gay community. There are numerous cafes, bars, clubs and saunas, catering to both a mixed and gay-only crowd. The The Tel Aviv Cinematheque screens gay films every month as part of its Pink Cinema Club.  Tel Aviv is a magnet for those from all over the country who want to have fun and be entertained. With a country whose past is so tainted by the fight for survival, there is very much a live-for-the-day attitude. This results in Israelis loving to go out and celebrate. This non-stop party is a bubble from some of the harsher realities of life in Israel. The attitude here is: Go dancing, sip coffee until late and \''yihiye beseder\'' (everything will be fine).</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (2031,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Central Tel Aviv,  Nahalat Binyamin, and the Waterfront</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The main roads in central Tel Aviv all run parallel to each other, which makes finding your way around easy. Going back to the coastline as a starting point, the beach is a highway of sorts, with walkers, joggers and cyclists breezing past. It is here that Tel Avivians come to relax: be that meditating, doing yoga at the water\''s edge, juggling, playing beach tennis, watching the waves, lying in the sun, flying kites or playing soccer. The Tayelet is the beach promenade which stretches from the old harbor of Tel Aviv to Jaffa.The road by the beach is Hayarkon (later Herbert Samuel Boulevard) and it is here that all of Tel Aviv\''s luxury hotels are to be found, along with many other accommodation options. There are also a sprinkle of eateries aimed at tourists. One street back from the beach road is Ben Yehuda Street. It is here you will find travel agents, backpacker facilities, souvenir shops and more eateries. As the road goes southwards, it becomes Allenby Street. This street is known for its liveliness and bargains and is packed with adult-only bars, pre-clubbing hang-outs and cheap and cheerful stores. Allenby Street is a corridor to many interesting places. It intersects with the Carmel Market, the Nachlat Binyamin craft market and the fashionable Sheinkin Street, where the cappuccino-sipping crowd come to see and to be seen.The third major road back from the street is Dizengoff Road. In its heyday, it was the Champs Elysees of Tel Aviv. A verb even existed in Hebrew, \"To Dizengoff,\" meaning to window shop with friends and have coffee. Today\''s Dizengoff Street has suffered somewhat with the advent of the shopping mall. However, there are still coffee shops and clothes shops aplenty, with designer name shops located at the northern end of Dizengoff. The street also has a large concentration of bridal outfitters. Towards the southern end of Dizengoff Street is the Dizengoff Centre shopping mall. There are many distinctive neighbourhoods in and around central Tel Aviv.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Old North</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">About a 10-minute walk away from the beach (some 5 minutes beyond Dizengoff Street), you will hit Ibn Gvirol Street, which is also a major thoroughfare. City Hall and Kikar Rabin (Rabin Square) are located along here as well as a huge number of restaurants, cafés and businesses.Kikar Medina in north Tel Aviv is the Rodeo Drive of Israel with designer stores located around a circular park. Also to the northern edge of town is Basel Square, a quiet, café lined square with a Continental feel.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Neve Tzedek and Jaffa</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Neve Tzedek is a historic district, with pastel painted properties positioned along winding alleys and is now a sought after Tel Aviv address. Further south is Jaffa, one of Israel\''s few mixed cities where Arabs and Jews co-exist. The old city of Jaffa is particularly quaint and is a popular spot for couples to have their wedding photos taken thanks to the surrounding gardens and sea views.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Tel Aviv and Florentin</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Florentine is also a south Tel Aviv neighbourhood. It achieved cult-like status after the launch of an Israeli TV drama <em>Florentine</em> which followed the lives and loves of young Tel Avivians living in the area. Herzl Street, which runs through Florentine, is known as the place to go to for furniture shopping. Many of the back alleys of Florentine are filled with furniture workshops.The Greater Tel Aviv area is home to 384,000 of the country\''s seven million occupants, so many faces of Israel can be found in this central part of the country. The poor areas of Hatikvah and the neighbourhoods surrounding the Central Bus Station are home to a large population of migrant workers, which gives the areas an ethnic, developing world feeling. Bnei Brak on the outskirts of Tel Aviv is home to ultra-Orthodox Jews and is couched in old world values. The seaside neighbourhood of Bat Yam is popular with immigrants from the Former Soviet Union.At first glance, the concrete architecture of Tel Aviv may seem both old and tired, but start exploring and you will soon discover the city\''s vibrancy and energy.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The best observation decks are located at Tokyo Skytree, the second tallest building in the world when it was completed in 2012, Sunshine 60 in Ikebukuro, the Municipal Government Building in Shinjuku, the World Trade Center in Hamamatsucho, and Tokyo Tower in Shiba. Whether to view the city\''s magnificent, sprawling landscape by day, or dazzling light-covered visage by night, each of these places offers a very different view of this iconic metropolis, but all are sure to have an equally stunning panorama that you won\''t soon forget.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Landmarks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Perhaps more than any other Japanese city, Tokyo is jam-packed with famous landmarks, each of which offers unique insights into the culture, history and heart of the Japanese people. Among its most notable spots for sightseers are the seismically active island nation\''s first modern skyscraper, the Kasumigaseki Building, that houses the heart of the nation\''s government, and the Tokyo Dome (the so-called \"Big Egg\") at Korakuen, home of the national champion Yomiuri Giants baseball team, as well as the popular Tokyo Dome City. At night, the colorfully lit Rainbow Bridge that spans Tokyo Bay is also not to be missed. For those looking for sightseeing that\''s a little more cultured, the Imperial Palace grounds are located at the very center of both the city and Japanese cultural identity, while the 100-year old Ueno Zoo to the northeast is great for kids and adults alike.  And, of course, always on the southwestern horizon is the picturesque Mt. Fuji, the most iconic feature of the Japanese landscape.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Gardens & Parks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\''re looking to get away from the city, there are many beautiful parks and gardens to visit, even in this most densely packed of all major Japanese cities. The Hama Rikyu Garden and Kiyosumi Garden are both beautifully ornate and dotted with ponds, sculpted bonsai trees and exotic flowers. Hibiya Park is located just outside Ginza, while Tokyo\''s largest, Ueno Park, is home to several museums, temples and even a zoo that is popular with children. Even amidst the brightly lit districts and thoroughfares, finding a spot for quiet repose in Tokyo is not a problem.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Amusement Parks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For those who require more active entertainment, the city teems with amusement parks and recreation centers. Tokyo Disneyland is the biggest attraction to the east; Tokyo DisneySea, Universal Studios and Legoland are a few of the other major amusement and theme parks in the city that welcome visitors of all ages.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Thanks to an incredible array of museums and galleries, Tokyo can be extremely entertaining even on a rainy day. The two major museums are arguably the National Museum of Western Art and the National Museum of Japanese History. Both will keep you occupied for the day. There are also a number of small museums that specialize in unique artistic forms. From the Bicycle Culture Center and the Museum of Tin Toys, to the Kite Museum, each houses an interesting collection of pieces that will teach you something new.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema & Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Of course, there are cinemas all around the city, some new and many old, each different and interesting. Uplink in Shibuya, Yurakucho Subaruza in Yurakucho and Shinjuku Ward 9 show films from first-run international releases to art movies and classics.  Tokyo also has its own opera house, a Shakespearean playhouse, and many venues for dance, such as the beautiful Spiral Hall, or the more modern Session House and Space Zero. Huge concert halls like the Ariake Coliseum, Tokyo Opera City and Zepp Tokyo have a regular schedule of live acts ranging from rock bands to orchestral quartets. In the evening you can sample some unique indoor relaxation at the National Noh Theater in Sendagaya, Kabuki-za in Ginza, the Puk Puppet Theater in Yoyogi or the Theater Tram for contemporary dance and dramatic performances.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports buffs will be happy to find all their favorite pastimes here. Professional baseball, sumo, soccer and volleyball are the major spectator sports in Tokyo, and betting is allowed on horse races, cycling and speedboat racing.  Rugby and tennis, ice hockey and boxing, all have their seasons here, and many of the world\''s top athletes make regular stops in Tokyo for track and field events. There are marathons for amateurs and pros alike, and locations abound for bowling, golf, billiards, darts, mah-jong and even ballroom dancing; check out the Tokyo Dome City to get started exploring the city\''s many sporting options.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Additionally, what would a metropolis be without an exciting club scene to party the night away? Serving up various kinds of popular and underground music, an array of different clubs around the city are open all night on the weekends to give clubbers a healthy dose of nightlife action.  Located on the outskirts of Tokyo and certainly the most sizable in comparison, Ageha is one of the top venues for fans of the electronic genre. However, if you\''re looking for something closer to the heart of the city with the same taste of music in mind, Womb is an excellent place to catch top notch DJs and sounds, while anyone who\''s looking for a good hip hop club should step over to Club Harlem.  Alternatively, clubs such as Muse and Hard Rock Tokyo are a good spot for all-mix selections and international crowds. Don\''t like dancing the night away, when you could be playing video games until late into the night?

Nihonbashi, \"Japan Bridge,\" is centuries old, although the present Western-style structure only dates back to the Meiji Period (1868-1912). Once a prominent landmark, it is today dwarfed by buildings and an overhead expressway. Mitsukoshi, Japan\''s oldest department store, which still stands on its original site, and Takashimaya, another venerable shopping institution, are worth visiting here. Nihonbashi is also home to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, whose museum should be a stop for anyone interested in the economic history of the industrial and high-tech powerhouse that is Japan.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Marunouchi-Otemachi</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is Tokyo\''s main business hub, and home to the country\''s three largest banks, as well as some of its most prominent companies, including Hitachi and Mitsubishi.  Flooded daily with both business people and tourists from all corners of the country, Marunouchi is a great place for touring the city\''s many impressive skyscrapers, including the Shin-Marunouchi Building, which houses over 150 stores, and is the tallest building in the Chiyoda Ward.  Located between Tokyo Station and the Imperial Palace, two stunning examples of Japanese architecture, modern and ancient, visitors can begin their tour of this district the moment they step off the train.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ginza</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Here you will find everything from department stores and boutiques like the famous Wako, to bookstores, bars, and restaurants that fit every taste and budget. Practically every major fashion label can be found in Ginza, and the number of upscale and high-street shopping complexes found here is truly astounding. Among the many commercial centers, Ginza Six, Itoya, and Marronnier Gate are worth a glance. Ginza is the nation\''s showcase. It is to Tokyo what Fifth Avenue is to New York and Oxford Streets are to London. On the flip-side of the coin, the Ginza is also where visitors can experience some of the most refined aspects of Japanese heritage and culture.  One example of this, Kabuki-za, the city\''s main Kabuki Theater since 1889, still puts on two shows daily and the vibrant Yurakucho Gado-shita Dining district is but a step away.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shibuya</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is one of the most lively wards in Tokyo, and encompasses Shinjuku and Harajuku, two popular districts for young people, and major centers of activity within the city that have the usual mix of department stores, shops, cafes and restaurants. The unique monument Hachiko, which commemorates a dog\''s loyalty to its master, can also be found right near Shibuya Station, where it commonly serves as a popular rendezvous point for Tokyoites. The famous Shinjuku Station, the busiest train station in the world, with some 4 million commuters passing through daily, is also located in Shibuya.Harajuku comes alive on weekends when the young and trendy come to see and be seen. This is where Tokyo\''s fashion-forward attitude manifests itself most prominently, with no shortage of off-the-wall outfits and hairstyles to be found strutting up and down the streets, particularly Jingu Bashi just outside Harajuku Station. If you tire of fashion, however, just around the corner from the train station are the Meiji Jingu Shrine, one of the most beautiful and sacred shrines in Japan, and the adjoining Yoyogi Park.   By day or night, the Shinjuku district is a lively, neon-lit place with a bit of the atmosphere of New York\''s Greenwich Village. Looking for a smoke-filled jazz joint? You can find it here, along with ramen noodles shops, <em>pachinko</em> (gambling) parlors, and such global brand stores as Tiffany and Gucci. There are also two major landmarks here: the Tokyo Tocho (Metropolitan Government Office), with its futuristic twin 48-story towers, and the huge Takashimaya Times Square department store, which is sure to sate even the most enthusiastic shopaholic.Also located in Shibuya are the neighborhoods of Azabu and Hiroo, where many expatriates reside in expensive high-rise buildings. It is here that some of the most sought-after properties in Tokyo can be found, as well as some of the most sacred, such as Samboji Temple, an important religious site of the Shingon Buddhist sect. There are many small, independently-owned, shops, cafes and restaurants in the area as well, like the Thrush Cafe with its upscale beer garden atmosphere. Many foreign embassies can also be found here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Yurakucho-Hibiya</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This district is close to the popular Ginza. Check out the quaint <em>yakitori</em> barbecue chicken stalls that are set up beneath the district\''s raised train tracks, enjoy a quiet moment among the flower beds of Hibiya Park, or take in the sight of the impressive Imperial Hotel, which was erected along the park by imperial edict in the 19th Century, and once featured a building designed by the eminent American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. You could also join the many joggers who can be seen circling the 5-kilometer/3.1-mile periphery of the Imperial Palace grounds, on what is otherwise called the Imperial Palace Jogging Course, or stick to a leisurely stroll around the Palace East Garden.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Roppongi</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A quick subway ride from Ginza will take you here, a place world famous for its raucous nightlife. Once a sleepy village, Roppongi is crowded with discos, clubs, bars, pubs and restaurants, including such trendy places as the Hard Rock Café and the massive Roppongi Hills mega-complex, which has just about everything a visitor could ask for, from stores to restaurants, and even a museum, all in one place.  You can\''t miss it; it\''s iconic Mori Tower is 54-stories tall. Tokyo Tower, modeled on the Eiffel Tower, but taller, is also visible and easily accessible from here. Take the elevator to the observatory; you might catch a glimpse of Mt. Fuji from up there on a clear day. Worn out from all the sightseeing?  Take a soak at the Shimizuyu, whose relaxing waters come from a natural hot spring underground.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Asakusa & Ueno</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bustling centers of city life during the Edo period (1603-1868), these two districts belong to what Tokyoites call <em>shitamachi</em>, or \"downtown.\" A must-see in Asakusa is Sensoji, Tokyo\''s oldest temple, the approach to which is lined by stores featuring colorful displays of traditional crafts, while the Sumida River Fireworks Festival, which attracts a crowd of more than one million people every year on the last Sunday in July, is a spectacle you won\''t want to miss.At Ameyoko market street in Ueno, you can pick up unusual bargains ranging from dried squid to fake designer shirts.  Culture buffs, however, should head for the Tokyo National Museum and the National Museum of Western Art, both located in Ueno Park, Tokyo\''s first public park, established in 1873, that is also home to the 100-year old Ueno Zoo.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Akasaka-mitsuke</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sometimes called \"Little Seoul\", this district has a small section of nightlife, but it caters mostly to local yen-loaded patrons. The Kotohiragu Shrine is a good place to stop to pick up some good luck charms, while others might prefer to browse the wares for sale at the flea markets at Nogi Jinja Shrine, where you\''re sure to find a good deal. The Akasaka Act Theater, featuring everything from live music to drama to dance, is also located here, and is a great place to spend an entertainment-filled evening.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Akihabara</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Also known as <em>Akihabara Denki Gai</em>, (Akihabara Electric Town), this is the major hub of <em>Otaku</em>, or \"geek,\" culture. People looking to buy electronic gadgets, computer accessories and anime/manga videos, books, toys and games know to come here, where they can not only get good prices but also meet people who share their special interests. Due to a recent boom in popularity, the cramped stores of Akihabara, like Animate with its 8 sprawling floors of everything from comics to anime soundtracks, are always abuzz with hip techno-ites. Another popular store, Sofmap, offers a huge selection of consumer electronics to choose from, spread out over 7 floors, while the Nishikawa Duty Free Square specializes in assisting foreigners with their high-tech purchases.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ikebukuro</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This district is most often visited for the sweeping view from the top of Sunshine City\''s 60-story tall center skyscraper, Sunshine 60, which was one of the first skyscrapers to be built in earthquake-prone Tokyo. Sunshine City itself is definitely worthy of its name; you can get lost in this huge cluster of buildings for days. Within its many walls are an indoor amusement park, movie theater, shopping mall, museum and planetarium. There\''s clearly something to keep everyone happy here. For inexpensive, traditional Japanese accommodations, the Kimi Ryokan is located conveniently close to Sunshine City, as well as transportation and other attractions. Many authentic but inexpensive dining options can also be found in Ikekuburo, including Nami for <em>okonomiyaki </em>(a type of savory pancake) and Mutekiya for ramenIkebukuro is also the home of the well-known Ankokuron-ji Temple of the Nichiren Buddhist sect.  It is said that it was on this site that Nichiren himself lived in a cave for three years, and wrote his famous religious tract entitled, <span class=\"descriptionFont\">\"Rissho Ankoku Ron,\" one of his defining treatises.  The temple was later established on the site in 1274. </span></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Korakuen</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is the site of the Tokyo Dome, Tokyo\''s modern sports arena that can accommodate up to 55,000 spectators. Baseball games are most popular here, but there are also concerts and festivals in the off-season. The Koishikawa-Korakuen Garden is attached to the Dome, offering a tranquil escape for those looking to have some peace and quiet.  And as if that weren\''t enough stimulus, the rest of the area in the immediate vicinity, known as Tokyo Dome City, features everything a tourist might want, from shopping and restaurants to a luxurious spa and an amusement park.  For something different in Korakuen, however, take a timeout to visit Muryozan Jukyoji Temple, where you can learn about the Shogunate Period. Many other famous religious sites are also located in the area as well, including Tennoji Temple, with its beautiful and ancient cherry trees, and Gokoku-ji, a major Buddhist Temple that dates back to 1680.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Odaiba</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Odaiba is an ongoing oceanfront development and artificial island, served by monorail, that has come to be commonly known as \"Tokyo Teleport Town\" in an effort to further cement it as a symbol of Tokyo\''s futuristic urban living plan. The Fuji TV Building is located here, along with one of the world\''s largest ferris wheels at Toyota\''s MegaWeb, several shopping malls, museums and even a full-size replica of the Statue of Liberty.  Lovers of video games must check out Tokyo Joypolis, where some of the most advanced simulation games abound, while toy collectors can join over 100,000 of their fellow enthusiasts in Odaiba at the annual International Tokyo Toy Show.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) boasts an extensive and well-presented collection of landscape paintings by Canada\''s famous Group of Seven. Don\''t miss the world\''s largest exhibit of Henry Moore sculptures, beautifully arranged by the artist. The AGO is also known for the skillfully simple Inuit stone carvings, as is the Toronto Dominion Gallery of Inuit Art. On a lighter note, the Bata Shoe Museum is unique; among their 10,000 shoes are Elvis\'' blue suede loafers. The Hockey Hall of Fame also has shoes, but only those with blades beneath them.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater & Performances</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Busloads of Americans drive for ten hours to spend just three hours in Toronto. With over 500 theater productions every year, the city on Lake Ontario is the second largest stage center in North America. You can see Kiefer Sutherland in a Tennessee Williams play or the metamorphosis of Kiss\''s hard-rocking lead singer to <em>Phantom (of the Opera)</em> in King Street\''s Royal Alexandra and Princess of Wales theaters. It is also worth going a little off the beaten track to catch more adventurous offerings in places such as Front Street\''s Sony Centre.  The grassroots of theater are just as fresh and strong in Toronto. Community-centered theaters such as Tarragon and the Factory master challenges like Beckett, as well as drama from new and upcoming playwrights. Modern dance has found a home in the Premiere Dance Theatre, a multicultural venue for music and movement at the Harbourfront Center. More classical but nevertheless innovative performances can be seen at the National Ballet Company, considered the top dance troupe in the country. The Yuk Yuk is still defending its position as the major comedy spots, but recently Rivoli\''s backroom has established a reputation for edgy comedy.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Not only is Toronto one of the most popular American film sets (watch out for huge white trucks and sealed-off streets) it is also a great movie theater city, especially at fringe and second-run cinemas like the Bloor or the Fox. The Toronto International Film Festival, considered among the top in the world, is held here annually.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightclubs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When in Toronto, you\''re in hot nightclub country, the places where cool and hip crowds hang out. Most clubs don\''t specialize in one style, but often change their playlist daily from retro to dub to techno in order to attract the most diverse dance crowd. Revelers can find pulsating haunts to party in several nooks in and around Downtown and the Entertainment District, from swish clubs with VIP seating, to casual dance clubs hosting youthful crowds. From Maison Mercer to the Velvet Underground, go party hopping along Toronto\''s storied nightlife.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Live Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For live music events, Horseshoe Tavern is the place to see a great young band before it fills the concert halls. Toronto is on the A-list for pretty much every major tour in North America, and gigs are hosted regularly in Toronto\''s celebrated concert venues from Rogers Centre multi-purpose stadium and the old Massey Hall to the Air Canada Centre. The repertoire of classical music offerings is too long to list, but Roy Thomson Hall is a safe starting point for excellent acoustics, be it for the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the Mendelssohn Choir or the latest Philip Glass opera.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Air Canada Centre is home to two of Toronto\''s big sports teams. Cheer the Raptors as they slam dunk against their NBA competitors and the popular blue-and-white Maple Leafs playing for ice hockey\''s Stanley Cup. They compete for spectators with the Blue Jays, who swing their baseball bats in the 53,000-seat Rogers Centre.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (2051,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Architecturally speaking, Toronto is an amalgam of different styles. In the early 19th Century, it took much of its architectural inspiration from the Georgian style. By the end of the 19th Century, the city opted for the heavier, bulkier lines of Richardsonian Romanesque. At the turn of the 20th Century, the Toronto City Council opted not to put a height restriction on downtown construction as many other cities had, thus giving rise to some of the tallest buildings in the British Commonwealth, most of which are found in Downtown, including the 34-storey Canadian Bank of Commerce, the Rogers Centre, the Royal Bank Plaza, and the TD Centre, to name a few. Of course, these buildings have been surpassed in recent years by the silhouettes that give Toronto its unique skyline: the CN Tower, the world\''s highest free-standing structure, with its rotating restaurant, gives diners a breath-taking view of the city, day or night.  The more than 7000 fine dining establishments, bars, cafes, bistros, clubs and dance halls (a large number of which can be found Downtown) suit every taste from bohemian to business.  The downtown area of the city also houses a number of stadiums and arenas where some of Canada\''s top-of-the-line professional sports teams—the Maple Leafs, the Raptors, the Blue Jays and the Argos—play. Race car fanatics will have no trouble picking up the roar of Molson Indy engines come summer during the Honda Indy Toronto.Running into Downtown is Yonge Street, the longest thoroughfare in the world and the main north-south route. The heart of Downtown also houses the Toronto Stock Exchange, second only in North America to the New York Stock Exchange.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Entertainment District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Overlapping Downtown, the Entertainment District is home to numerous world-class museums, art galleries, theaters, dance companies, festivals and parades that add creativity and culture to an already vibrant city. Any of these could serve to define Toronto. While the city may once have had a reputation as Toronto The Good, a nondescript place which shut down and rolled up the sidewalks at sundown, nothing could be further from the truth today. The city is alive with some of the best theaters, museums and galleries anywhere. For example, Toronto is the third largest center of English-speaking theater productions in the world (next to London and New York), with more than 200 professional theater companies and 10,000 performances a year.  One of the oldest theater spaces in the city, the Royal Alexandra dates back to the early 20th Century. Saved from demolition by bargain store king and impresario \"Honest\" Ed Mirvish, the theater was renovated at great expense and brought back to its original splendor, and is now home to some of Broadway and the West End\''s finest productions, from <em>Phantom of the Opera</em> to <em>Cats</em>. The Royal Ontario Museum and the Art Gallery of Ontario present spectacular exhibits for the entire family, while the National Ballet is a world-class dance troupe.  There\''s even a thriving film industry in the city. Often called \"Hollywood North,\" Toronto is sought after for its diversity, locations, excellent production centers and local talent. The Toronto International Film Festival, which takes place annually in September, draws countless film-goers.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chinatown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A multi-ethnic \''meeting place\'' that Toronto is widely known as, has given the city an exciting and infectious energy. It has also created a place of wonderful neighborhoods, each with its defining character and local color. With a plethora of different cultures and neighborhoods bumping into one another like pieces of tectonic plates, the cuisine is as diverse as the population—and matching any taste and affordability, from the unlimited expense account to those counting their pennies. In fact, while there are plenty of upscale haute-cuisine restaurants where price is of no concern, some of the best food Toronto has to offer is tucked away in the small eateries of the city\''s original Chinatown. Here you will find Chinese, Vietnamese, Malaysian, Thai, Indonesian and Japanese dishes to satisfy both the timid and the adventurous. You can also spend a day shopping at the Dragon City Shopping Mall at Dundas and along Spadina Avenue where East meets West.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">West Suburbs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Aside from the Air Canada Centre and the Rogers Centre housing the city\''s pro sports teams, Toronto is also known for its Woodbine horse track, the largest racing property in North America and home to the Queen\''s Plate thoroughbred race held each August. This racetrack in located in the West Suburbs, an area not often visited by tourists, but charming nonetheless.  While there is so much to see and do, to experience and taste, it\''s the residents of Toronto who give the city its special cachet. More often than not, people are glad to stop and give you directions. And don\''t be surprised if they try and chat a while, recommending places to go or filling you in on pieces of their city\''s history. This is what Toronto is all about.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Both the Arizona Opera and the Tucson Symphony Orchestra usually perform at the Tucson Convention Center Music Hall, the main venue for high culture downtown. If you are culturally more in tune with the progressive camp, check out the Borderlands Theatre or the Invisible Theatre for avant-garde, political productions and light comedy. For laughs, take yourself and your family to the Gaslight Theatre, Tucson\''s only dinner theater, where you can munch on sandwiches and ice cream cones while watching Western dramas with lots of music, slapstick and practical jokes.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The variety of Tucson nightlife defies stereotypes about the kind of entertainment a Western town has to offer. In fact, most clubs offer alternative rock instead of country and western music. The blues is very much alive in Tucson, with local acts taking turns at Margarita Bay and various other clubs. Venues for live jazz are rarer; try the Cascade Lounge at Loews Ventana Canyon Resort for light dinner jazz on Thursday to Sunday afternoons. While the western section of downtown is dominated by the temples of high art, the eastern part belongs to the \"dark\" forces of alternative rock, centered around the legendary Club Congress on the ground floor of the equally famous Hotel Congress. It\''s featured as \"The World\''s Darkest Nightclub,\" and once you\''ve stepped inside, you will see why it deserves that title (if you can see anything at all). Right across the street from the club there is the Rialto Theatre, a vaudeville theater that has been restored to its glorious old past, now featuring big names in blues and rock from out of town. There are, of course, various places for country and western, but for the most authentic brand, you\''ll have to drive to the out-of-the-way Li\''l Abner\''s Steakhouse on a Friday or Saturday night. If you enjoy country dancing, join the patrons crowding into the dance floor at The Maverick, an establishment which frequently features top country and western acts, as it has for five decades.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tucson\''s art scene is very much alive and thriving, particularly on the gallery and studio level. There are plenty of museums and galleries displaying the entire range of artistic styles, from realistic paintings of Southwestern scenes to multimedia installations. Although it is still a mainstay of traditional Western art, visitors should be aware that Tucson is slowly becoming a driving force for cutting-edge international contemporary practices.The Tucson Museum of Art, the main exhibitor of contemporary art in the city for more than 40 years, has recently been expanded to include both Western art and contemporary experimental works, as well as a gallery of pre-Columbian pieces. A little further to the east, the University of Arizona Museum of Art offers a good sampling of famous 20th-century sculpture and a collection of Renaissance art. The Center for Creative Photography across the street houses one of the best collections of photographs in the world, including the work of renowned photographer Ansel Adams. Its archives, which are open to the public, contain the works of hundreds of other first-rate photographers. The city\''s real strengths, however, reside in its science and history museums, particularly the on-campus Arizona State Museum with its splendid displays of Native Southwestern art, and the Arizona Historical Society Museum, which is devoted to the local history of Native Americans, Mexicans and pioneers.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As a place offering consistently dry and sunny weather throughout the year, Tucson is popular with golfers around the world. Green fees vary from course to course and from season to season, with municipal courses like the Fred Enke Municipal Golf Course offering lower rates than resorts such as the Ventana Canyon Golf Courses in the foothills. The horse racing season at the recently expanded Rillito Park Racetrack lasts from early February into March, with more races scheduled at the Pima County Fair in April, along with horse shows, gun shows, and various kinds of other diversions. And, of course, no entertainment guide to the Old Pueblo would be complete without the Tucson Rodeo, <em>La Fiesta de los Vaqueros</em> as it is called in Spanish, the largest winter rodeo in the United States. If you\''re here in late February, you just simply can\''t ignore it.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Family Friendly</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tucson offers a variety of diversions for kids. Proposing to take them to the zoo is usually a sure bet. While Reid Park Zoo offers a good variety of assorted international animals, the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum is more unique in presenting creatures of the desert in their natural habitats, with spectacular desert views. Another sure winner is a visit to Old Tucson Studios, a Western theme park and movie location surrounded by giant sahuaro cacti, not too far from the Desert Museum west of the city. Cowboy stunts and gunfights are also available in Trail Dust Town, especially during Trail Dust Days; and you don\''t have to be a kid to enjoy it.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (2061,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Of all the neighborhoods in Tucson, downtown offers the most variety. Century-old adobe homes, Victorian mansions, imposing government buildings, museums and affordable restaurants lie within easy walking distance of each other. It\''s a favorite destination for artists and art lovers, with numerous galleries and studios situated in and around the Old Town Artisans marketplace, just a block north of the Tucson Museum of Art. Downtown is also the site of the city\''s major performing arts events, with the Tucson Convention Center and the Temple of Music and Art providing the main venues for opera, symphony and dance performances. Renewal has already been quite successful in the Barrio Historico, the now-gentrified Hispanic historic quarter south of the Convention Center, where old Spanish-style homes have been largely restored to their original beauty. Take your time to explore this area on foot after leaving your car in one of the parking garages downtown.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Tucson</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bordering downtown Tucson on the south, the small municipality of South Tucson has become a largely Hispanic community. For out of town visitors, its main attractions are the Mexican restaurants, which, although low profile and inexpensive, offer the best of south-of-the-border food in town. The quality at places like Michas and Mi Nidito is hard to match. Moving further to the south, the Hispanic influence deepens, intermingling with the Native American people living in and around the Tohono O\''odham Reservation in Tucson\''s far southwest. Many visitors get at least a glimpse of this area going to and from Tucson International Airport, the Desert Diamond Casino on the reservation, or on the road to visit Mission San Xavier del Bac, a national landmark and by far the most attractive site on this side of town.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North and the Foothills</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In Tucson, \"north\" generally means \"north of Broadway,\" with Broadway Boulevard as the dividing line between north-south street numbers. Bounded on the north by the natural barriers of the Santa Catalina Mountains and Coronado National Forest, this area includes the University of Arizona campus with its many venues for science and art as well as the city\''s main business and shopping areas, with the Tucson Mall and the Foothills Mall considered by many to be the biggest and the best of them. Further to the north, the land and the income level slowly rise all the way up to the tony Foothills residential district. This area features beautiful homes with a view, surrounded by stately saguaro cacti and mesquite trees, outside the city limits and well out of reach of Tucson\''s tax authorities. Wintertime visitors relax after a game of golf at one of the posh resorts in the area, such as the Westin La Paloma, Westward Look or Loews Ventana Canyon Resort.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Northwest</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Northwest essentially means that big chunk of Tucson stretching from Oracle Road, the main north-south artery, and I-19 westward to the base of the Tucson Mountains and the Tohono O\''odham Indian Reservation. Bordered on the northwest by the ever-expanding residential and recreational retreat of Oro Valley (more golf courses here), this part of the city offers few visual attractions other than Tohono Chul Park, a very civilized, pleasant desert garden with an artsy touch. Once you\''re past I-10, the road starts snaking into the grandeur of Saguaro National Park West, covered by entire forests of the giant cacti that gave the park its name, and the site of several ancient Indian petroglyphs. Don\''t miss the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum on the far side of the Tucson Mountains, and consider stopping at Old Tucson Studios for the sake of the kids.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Northeast</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bounded roughly on the west by Wilmot Road, the Rincon and Catalina Mountains on the east and north, and Interstate 10 on the south, expansion of this district is largely limited by state and federal lands. The most attractive natural feature in the northeast is certainly Sabino Canyon, the most accessible part of the Catalinas, which teems with tourists, trams, hikers and joggers on weekends while still retaining its serene beauty. If you are an outdoors person, you will also appreciate the vast expanses of Saguaro National Park. Enjoy the desert and mountain scenery, and try not to disturb the roving of the native scorpions and rattlesnakes.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

On the other hand, it is also an interesting and multifaceted city, rich in history. Formerly the capital of Italy, and linked to the Savoy tradition, it is a city of charm, brimming with historic monuments and bearing the entrepreneurial spirit of a city in continual economic growth. An ordered city, built to an urban plan with linear streets from the Roman period, Turin\''s history is steeped in its very architecture.

 (2079,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You\''ll find a number of cinemas catering to a population of less than one million inhabitants. Unlike many other European cities, whose cinemas show specific genres of films, the cinemas of Turin show all kinds of movies - from recent American blockbusters to Italy\''s finest offerings. The majority of cinemas in Turin are found in the city center. There\''s also il Reposi, which has five screens showing an exceptional variety of films, and l\''ambrosio with its three screens facing the bustling Lucky Nugget Saloon. For art-house film lovers, il Cinema Massimo offers screenings of foreign films in their original languages, as well by pieces from new film makers. It is also the seat of various festivals and numerous events dedicated to contemporary directors.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The theater season in Turin is extremely varied. The Teatro Stabile organization deserves special merit, offering programmes of works at theaters like Carignano and Alfieri. Opera has its own special space devoted to it in the elegant Teatro Regio, and right next door, the below-ground theater Piccolo Regio hosts multiple productions and ballets. Celebrated performances can also be seen at the welcoming Teatro Nuovo, as well as the Alfa Teatro. If you love foreign theater companies and avant-garde performances, then the best place to go is Araldo.Turin\''s passion for cabaret and comedy is deeply rooted, so make sure to check out the performances at Teatro Erba, home of the Cabaret Festival. Teatro Juvarra and Cab 41 are the places to go for some sophisticated singing or a bit of a laugh.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For those who want to make a night of it, there are discos and disco-pubs (loved by the young trendy set). Every year, a new fashionable \''in\'' establishment springs up, and quickly becomes <em>the</em> place to see and be seen. La Gare, which was once a building used as a recreational club for railway workers before becoming the haunt of Turin\''s crème de la crème, is still going strong. If Latin-American salsa is more your thing, then Ganas de Mar is the best disco in Turin to let yourself go.You can also spend an evening chatting and joking with friends. At the moment, Irish themed pubs are all the rage, and Shamrock Inn is the best loved among them. People often sit on the steps inside than choosing a more traditional (and less crowded) pub. Another favorite haunt is the Divina Commedia, which has three floors to choose from, including \"Inferno\", \"Purgatory\" and \"Paradise\". Something to please everyone, indeed.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Art</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As <span>Piedmont\''s capital, steeped in a royal past, Turin has an excellent selection of museums for art enthusiasts and history buffs alike. Among the top choices, the city\''s </span>Egyptian Museum<span> is truly exceptional and has a curated collection of ancient artifacts. For cinephiles, the </span>Museo Nazionale del Cinema<span> is an excellent pick and the Museo Nazionale dell\''automobile throws light on the city\''s auto-manufacturing legacy. Football is close to the heart here, and the </span>J Museum - Museo Della Juventus<span> pays homage to the achievements of this Champion League club based out of Turin. For a glimpse of a far away land, the </span>MAO - Museo d\''arte Orientale\''s<span> collection displays a beautiful collection of Asian art, sculptures and artifacts. </span></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cafe Culture</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Turin\''s cafe culture is hard to beat and one might imagine coffee flows through this city\''s veins. Historical cafes serve up cups of strong espresso and decadent cups of <em>bicerin</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">,</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"></em>a layered concoction of espresso, chocolate and cream. While the best place to enjoy a glass is at Caffé Al Bicerin, where the drink is said to have been invented, the myriad cafes around the city all make a great drink. Other atmospheric spots to get a caffeine fix include Caffé Torin, dating back to 1903, whose chandelier-illuminated interiors add a splash of elegance to the experience.

 (2080,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Center</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The physical, historic, and cultural center is the symbol of the ancient capital of the Savoy kingdom. Turin would not be the same without its palaces, such as the Palazzo Madama and the Palazzo Reale, or without the porticoes dating from the baroque period. Built to protect the royal family and their court from bad weather, these stunning architectural pieces are visible from a walk which winds around the center for 18 kilometers. Starting from the Porta Nuova, visitors can walk to Piazza Castello, under the porticoes which are surrounded by shops, bars and cafes of all kinds, until they reach the River Po. Crossing Piazza San Carlo and Piazza Carlo Felice, walk opposite Palazzo Reale until, in the distance beyond the Piazza Vittorio bridge, the Gran Madre is visible. The numerous cafés in the center are an excellent refuge in the cold winter days, and provide a sanctuary where one can warm up with tea or a hot chocolate. Platti offers seductive desserts, while Pfatish lures customers with its chocolates. The Caffe Torino is a perfect place to taste <em>bicerin, </em>a local favorite drink consisting of melted chocolate, coffee, and milk; while Baratti, in the Galleria Subalpina has an intriguing atmosphere reminiscent of the far-off days of princes and princesses. On the opposite side of Piazza Castello is the Cathedral which houses the Holy Shroud and is currently undergoing restoration after the fire of a few years ago. The Mole Antonelliana stands out among the other buildings, and offers a splendid landscape view of the city to anyone who wants to climb to the top.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Crocetta-Cenisia</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is a mostly residential area which is popular with the Torinesi for its elegance. The famous Crocetta Market offers a wide variety of quality products in a traditional setting. This is the place to take a deep breath of good Turin air in the midst of distinguished buildings and sophisticated shops.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mirafiori</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This area is mainly associated with Fiat, which has its enormous factories here. In the last ten years, this working class area has been revamped and is now one of the most popular places for people looking to buy a new house. There are many green areas in the area, including the famous park, Parco del Valentino and Superga\''s Park.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Turin</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This area is densely populated and contains many shops, but the large number of crowded buildings darken the atmosphere. There are a number of wholesale shops in the area, such as Revedi, but tourists generally prefer to shop in the center of town. For a more unique tour, make note that Turin is one of thirty three international official centers for witchcraft. Their focal point is either the astrological sundial on the right side of the Cathedral or the Egyptian Museum, which has the second best collection of Egyptian cultural and traditional material and documentation in the world.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">San Salvario</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The multi-ethnic area of Turin extends from Porta Nuova to Porte Palatine. The large number of immigrants pouring into Turin in the last few years have settled in this area and have recreated the unique atmospheres of their homelands. The Torinesi have partly abandoned this area, which is one of the districts most in need of rehabilitation.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

When they do, you will find them at large venues like B.C. Place, General Motors Place, the Vogue, Orpheum Theatre or Queen Elizabeth Theatre. Vancouver\''s music scene is diverse. The Chan Centre for the Performing Arts at the University of British Columbia, and the Orpheum Theatre, home of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, are great venues for classical music performances. For jazz, blues and fusion, the best bets are the Roxy, Pat\''s Pub, Frankie\''s Jazz Club, Guilt & Company, and the Blue Martini Jazz Cafe. For punk, indie and other aural alternatives, smaller venues like the Commodore Ballroom feature local and international talent in intimate settings. In-store performances at Red Cat Records also boast quite a niche following.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Several first-run movie theaters are within a few blocks of each other in downtown Vancouver. Across the bridge, the newer Fifth Avenue Cinemas show popular art and alternative films to West Side crowds. For independent, art, foreign and experimental films, check out the diverse listings at the Pacific Cinematheque. Vancouver also has one large-screen theater - the Alcan Omnimax Theatre at Science World. Mega-screen movie theaters have been popping up across the city over the last few years, and there are more than a few to be found in and around the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From classic Broadway hits to innovative productions, rich and varied theatrical activity has always been a part of the city\''s entertainment scene. The 2,929-seat Queen Elizabeth Theatre is the city\''s largest. It\''s perfect for seeing touring musicals, international opera and modern dance. Next door to the QE is the more intimate Vancouver Playhouse, a 668-seat auditorium that stages plays, concerts, chamber music recitals and modern dance performances. Other theatre and concert venues include the Arts Club Theatre, the refurbished Stanley Theatre, Orpheum, Firehall Arts Centre, Presentation House Gallery and the Vancouver East Cultural Centre.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Comedy</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For seriously funny stuff, try Yuk Yuk\''s. It has theatre-style seating, a full dinner menu and stand-up comics from the city and around the world. The Arts Club Theatre on Granville Island is another venue for interactive fun. It\''s home to the Theatre Sports improv group.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Vancouver offers a medley of sports events. From September to May, the NHL\''s Vancouver Canucks play the coolest game on earth at Rogers Arena. June kicks off with the pre-season games of the Canadian Football League. You can catch the B.C. Lions in action from July to late October at B.C.

They occur all over the city and offer locals and visitors a chance to mingle.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As the sun sets, the city\''s bars and nightclubs gear up for a night of parties, drinks and fun. Vancouver\''s nightlife is mainly centered around five neighborhoods, each a characterful medley of venues with a distinct vibe of its own. The stretch of Granville Street between Robson and Nelson is home to Vancouver\''s scintillating nightclubs; a neon-lit strip lined with jam-packed bars and booming clubs overflowing with partygoers. This is where the youth of the city head to unwind with a drink or two before hitting the dancefloor at clubs like The Roxy and Republic. In contrast, Yaletown caters to a more sophisticated clientele with a line-up of chic cocktail bars, trendy pubs and wine bars. The Yaletown Brewery is a great place to begin the evening, moving on to more upscale choices like the OPUS Bar and Bar None. Gastown\''s eclectic and ever-evolving nightlife offer boasts popular venues like The Lamplighter, L\''abattoir and Irish Heather. Here, old-world charm melds with hipster cool to create a veritable cornucopia of diversity. The neighborhoods of Kitsilano and Main Street also have much to offer but are lesser known than their more exuberant counterparts. Bars like the Bimini Public House is a stalwart of Kitsilano\''s nightlife scene, while Main Street is an upcoming alternative blessed with craft breweries and bespoke cocktail bars. Davie Village, on the other hand, is Vancouver\''s LGBTQ-friendly hangout that welcomes all with open arms for a night on the town.Dig a little deeper and you\''ll find hidden gems aplenty amid Vancouver\''s glitzy nightlife, like the Regional Assembly of Text where the Letter Writing Club descends every Thursday night; Pub 340 for gritty live music and pinball; Steamworks for monthly eco-themed Green Drinks Socials; St Augustine\''s and The Whip for guest cask events; and the Fox and Biltmore for cabaret.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Vancouver is one of those rare cities that effortlessly balances the perks of a big city with the vast and wondrous outdoors. Grouse Mountain is one of Vancouver\''s most visited outdoor attractions with year-round activities like hiking, biking and skiing to enjoy. Parks like the Lynn Canyon and Stanley are the city\''s green lungs; oases of natural wonder amid the urban landscape of the city. Nearby, the Capilano Suspension Bridge and Regional Park boast hiking trails, totem poles and spectacular scenery.In winter, the Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort takes center stage, while Locarno and Jericho Beach are summer-time escapes.

 (2089,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Vancouver has vitality and style. Nowhere is this more evident than in the downtown core. Its first distinct feature is Stanley Park, located on the west end of Georgia Street. This 1000-acre (400-hectare) park includes an 11-kilometer (6.8-mile) Seawall promenade, old-growth forests, hiking trails, and the Vancouver Aquarium.  Downtown is the city\''s largest shopping district. One of its main arteries is Robson Street, a highlight for both locals and visitors alike. Brimming with fashion boutiques, coffee bars and trendy cafes, it is where the heart of this metropolis beats. Crossing Robson is Granville, a street that offers independent fashion stores and entertainment venues. Shops like John Fluevog Shoes and True Value Vintage are here, as well as the city\''s \"Theatre Row,\" where concert, theater, and cinemas can be found. The Orpheum Theatre and the Commodore Ballroom, also on Granville, are two of the city\''s premier destinations for live entertainment. Vancouver\''s downtown has restaurants to satisfy every palette, urban nightclubs, and a dizzying number of bars offering live entertainment that are befitting of a beacon of multiculturalism.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Gastown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is where Vancouver first took root in 1867 and is a celebrated heritage district. Cobblestone streets, Victorian street lamps, and heritage architecture give the area an enchanting old-world atmosphere. The iconic Steam Clock at Cambie and Water streets goes off every 15 minutes and adds to the area\''s quirky cachet of old world charms. Today, boutiques and specialty shops, such as Hill\''s Native Art, Three Centuries Shop, and Salmagundi West, indie art galleries and hip restaurants combine with its historic character to breathe life into the neighborhood\''s well-trod streets.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chinatown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Vancouver\''s Chinatown is one of the largest in North America, second only to San Francisco\''s. The area\''s specialty shops, superb dining, and heritage buildings attract millions of visitors. Summers are celebrated with pomp and show at the open-air Chinatown Night Market, while packed restaurants such as Hon\''s Wun-Tun House or Floata Seafood Restaurant dole out scrumptious Asian fare year round. The Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden is the tranquil flipside of the bustling Chinatown, while traditional apothecaries lie shrouded in mystery, their shelves lined with nameless ingredients for age-old remedies. Interspersed in between are old-school dim sum restaurants, groceries selling exotic produce and colorful shops overflowing with souvenirs.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Yaletown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Not long ago, Yaletown was just a collection of abandoned warehouses. Today, it is one of the city\''s trendiest neighborhoods, dotted with posh condominiums and converted historic warehouses. Popular establishments include the Yaletown Brewing Co., and unique boutiques like Barking Babies. Yaletown is also known for its fantastic nightlife, spearheaded by venues like Bar None.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Granville Island</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A former industrial site, Granville Island has become one of the city\''s biggest and best attractions. Live theater, pubs, and artist workshops converge here. The public market is a one-stop-shop for local specialties and fresh produce, while Granville Island Hat Shop and the colorful Kids Only Market are other popular favorites. Numerous festivals use the island as their headquarters, including the Vancouver International Writer\''s Festival and the Vancouver International Comedy Festival.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kitsilano</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Located minutes south of downtown, Kitsilano is known for its active population, beaches and mountain views. The community has a profusion of eateries, bookstores, theaters, bars, open-air grocers, and boutiques. Here, you\''ll find gems like the Naam, Sophie\''s Cosmic Cafe and Kidsbooks. Vanier Park accommodates the annual Vancouver International Children\''s Festival in May, as well as the summer\''s open-air Shakespearean Bard on the Beach productions.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Point Grey</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just to the west of Kitsilano is Point Grey, another residential area. One of the wealthiest regions of the city, it boasts stately homes, miles of waterfront, and one of Vancouver\''s oldest parks. The area\''s beaches stretch from Jericho Beach to Spanish Banks, offering ample choice for swimming, sailing and walks. It also has a cluster of antique and collectible shops, and is home to the annual Vancouver Folk Festival. West Point Grey Park provides one of the city\''s most dramatic viewpoints, with the University of British Columbia (UBC) just south of it. UBC has an expansive campus, featuring several of the city\''s best museums and attractions, including the Museum of Anthropology and the Nitobe Memorial Gardens.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">East Vancouver</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Vancouver\''s east side has always been known for its multitude of ethnic neighborhoods and unconventional shopping and entertainment. Once dubbed \"Little Italy,\" the area on Commercial Drive, between Broadway and Venables, is often considered the city\''s hub for artists and counter-culture. Shops and cafes like Pupuseria Rinconcito Salvadoreno and La Casa Gelato help piece together this diverse community. You can also wander through pockets of eclectic galleries and second-hand shops, such as Cosmopolis and Attic Treasures.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">West Vancouver</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This suburban area northwest of downtown is one of the most prosperous communities in Canada. If you\''re looking for a place to shop, head to the large Park Royal Centre - the country\''s first shopping mall. Be sure to take time out to walk through the 80-acre (32-hectare), old-growth forests of Lighthouse Park where visitors often spot seals lounging on the rocks near Howe Sound.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Vancouver</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just next to West Vancouver lies North Vancouver. The lower Lonsdale area has heritage buildings, antique stores and specialty shops, while the Lonsdale Quay Market is a thriving waterfront treat. North Vancouver is the gateway for several of the area\''s ecological sites. Tourists will revel in the splendor of Lynn Canyon Park, the thrill of the Capilano Suspension Bridge, and the majesty of the Fraser Valley.

Both are worthy of note and their prominent location at the Ringstraße makes them easily accessible as well. The KunstHausWien is the antithesis of classical museums, designed by the famous Austrian painter and sculptor Friedensreich Hundertwasser. The building itself is quite inspiring, as are the exhibitions held here, featuring mostly 20th-century modern art. The Museumsquartier also boasts a couple of small galleries that feature photographic exhibitions. A classic is the Belvedere gallery showcasing some of Austria\''s most valuable paintings, such as Klimt\''s <em>The Kiss</em>.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theater</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Burgtheater is not only Austria\''s national theater but is also one of the world\''s most prominent German theaters and Vienna\''s prime venue for the performing arts.  In contrast, the 19th-century Volkstheater hosts traditional performances alongside new interpretations of classic and modern literature for a wider audience than that catered to by the classical Burgtheater. The Theater in der Josefstadt is another popular venue, and the city\''s oldest, still running theater, originally established in 1788. For theatrical performances in English, head to Vienna\''s acclaimed English Theatre for vibrant renditions of American classics, comedy, thrillers and contemporary works. The English Theater is not only one of the city\''s most favored destinations for the performing arts but is also the oldest English-language theater in continental Europe. The satirical cabaret shows staged across the city are also quite enjoyable; the Ronacher is a great place to catch one of these.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Classical Music & Opera</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Classical music is still the soundtrack for Viennese culture; a legacy that is so deeply embedded in the fabric of the city that strains of melodious symphonies seem to pervade every corner. The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and the Vienna Mozart Orchestra regularly perform at the Musikverein - a legendary venue that is said to have the best acoustics of any concert hall in Austria, if not in the world. Just a stone\''s throw away is the Konzerthaus, which boasts the capacity to stage up to three performances simultaneously, while the Schönbrunn Palace hosts outdoor classical concerts each summer. Visitors to Vienna should not miss a night at the world famous Staatsoper (State Opera), oft ranked among the world\''s top five opera houses. Another popular venue for opera is the Volksoper (People\''s Opera), whose repertoire includes operettas and musicals.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">In Concert</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While the city\''s taste for classical music is one that is world renown, Vienna also hosts live music performances featuring more contemporary genres. Within walking distance of each other, the Chelsea and the Rhiz are top choices for rock and alternative performances by both international artists and local bands. On the other hand, Jazzland is one of Vienna\''s few real jazz clubs. The Radiokulturhaus also hosts international jazz musicians while large-scale concerts by pop ensembles are often featured at the Stadthalle.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Some say Vienna is the old-fashioned capital of a small country. Its nightlife, however, suggests otherwise. Everything from cozy bars for an intimate tête-à-tête to a huge clubs for a night of dancing can be found here. The most popular nightlife district is the so-called Bermuda Triangle—the area around Ruprechtsplatz, Seitenstettengasse, Rabensteig and Salzgries. There you will find bars such as First Floor, pubs like the Krah-Krah and live-music venues such as Der Neue Engel. The club scene is spread out in Vienna; at places like Volksgarten or U4, you will find a young crowd dancing to commercial house and mainstream music. Lastly, at Flex, the accent is on independent music, hip-hop, drum and bass, trip-hop and all sorts of electronic tunes, Viennese style.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Film</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinemas in Vienna screen mainly Hollywood productions, including the latest U.S. releases, sometimes with a short delay. Films are generally dubbed, but exceptions do exist. There is an annual film festival, the Viennale, which features a wide range of international films as well as local productions. Cinemas screening more niche genres can also be found - the Votiv or the Filmcasino screen mainly independent films.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Vienna Extraordinaire</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Prater, the extraordinary amusement park with its gigantic Ferris wheel, also featured in the film <em>Before Sunrise</em>, is a place that appeals to the young at heart. Enjoy traditional food from the many stalls, or give one of the dizzying rides a whirl if you\''re up for a thrill.The Spanish Riding School (<em>Spanische Hofreitschule</em>) is another uniquely Viennese attraction that hosts performances by the famous snow-white Lipizzaner stallions.With origins that date back to 1498, the Vienna Boys\'' Choir (Wiener Sängerknaben), sings every Sunday at the Burgkapelle (Royal Chapel) in Hofburg.

Right through the 1st District runs Kärntner Straße, a pedestrian zone and shopping boulevard that is anchored by the State Opera at one end and Stephansdom at the other.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">2nd District: Leopoldstadt</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><p dir=\"ltr\">Leopoldstadt, the city\''s 2nd District, is separated from the center of Vienna by the Danube Canal and, along with the 20th District, Brigittenau, forms a misshapen island bordered to the east by the main arm of the canal. For the most part, this area is a residential suburb only redeemed by the Prater, the vast city park with its funfair, the Augarten, and the Wiener Kriminalmuseum. Between 1600 and 1939, Leopoldstadt was the center of Vienna\''s Jewish community. In the mid-19th Century, thousands of Jews took the opportunity to leave Bohemia, Moravia, Hungary, and Galicia and migrate to the capital of the Habsburg Empire. The Strauss family, Sigmund Freud, Gustav Mahler, Arthur Schnitzler and Theodor Herzl all lived here at some point, before upgrading to the city\''s wealthier suburbs.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">3rd District: Landstraße</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Vienna\''s 3rd District lies to the east and southeast of the Innere Stadt, framed to the east by the Danube Canal (<em>Donaukanal</em>), and to the west by Prinz-Eugen-Straße and Arsenalstrasse. It is a predominantly working-class neighborhood. The one exception is the diplomatic quarter close to Schwarzenbergplatz and around the extraordinary rococo palace Belvedere. Here you will also find the Hundertwasserhaus, a colorful, architectural masterpiece, and the St. Marx Cemetery, Mozart\''s final resting place.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">4th District: Wieden</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In Wieden, situated between Karlsplatz, Wienzeile and Gürtel, the atmosphere is more splendid than in the neighboring 3rd District. The 4th is one of the more well-presented residential suburbs close to the city center. Here, you will find Radiokulturhaus, the Vienna Museum of History, and the Naschmarkt, Vienna\''s biggest and most exciting market.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">5th District: Margareten</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Margareten lies next to Wieden between Gürtel and Wienzeile and is mostly a working-class suburb. There aren\''t very many attractions in this district, besides the Filmcasino.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">6th & 7th Districts: Mariahilf & Neubau</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Between Wienzeile and Lerchenfelderstrasse, Ringstrasse and Gürtel you will find the districts of Mariahilf and Neubau, divided by Vienna\''s biggest shopping boulevard, the Mariahilferstrasse. Once home to several warehouses and beautiful patrician mansions, the neighborhood fell into a state of despair when housing conditions deteriorated in the 1950s and property values fell. Today, the 6th and the 7th Districts offer the busiest nightlife in town; the old warehouses have been transformed into fashionable studios and apartments, chic bars, and dazzling nightclubs.  The 6th district is also home to the Vienna State Opera and the flea market on Wienzeile that takes place every Saturday.<p dir=\"ltr\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">8th & 9th Districts: Josefstadt & Alsergrund</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Between Ringstraße and Gürtel, lie the districts of Josefstadt and Alsergrund, two very nice residential areas with large patrician houses. Many wealthy Viennese, who prefer to live in the city center and not in a villa outside of town, have flats here. The main attractions are the Theater in der Josefstadt, the Volksoper, and the Sigmund Freud Museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">10th, 11th & 12th Districts: Favoriten, Simmering & Meidling</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The only significant sight in these districts south of the Gürtel is the Zentralfriedhof in the outskirts of Simmering. Generally speaking, these are working-class suburbs dominated by flat buildings, ranging from 1920s tenement housing to the huge project-type blocks of the 1980s and 1990s.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">13th District: Hietzing</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This area of town is a pleasant suburb west of the 5th district with splendid villas and gardens, ranging from the Biedermeier summer residences (enjoyed by the 19th-century nobility) to the Art Nouveau Jugendstil and modernist villas favored by the successful artists and businessmen of the late-imperial era. Here, you will find the famous Cafe Dommayer, Schloss Schönbrunn and the Lainzer Tiergarten - the former imperial hunting ground that is nowadays Vienna\''s second largest park.<p dir=\"ltr\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">14th, 15th & 16th Districts: Rudolfsheim & Ottakring</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The patrician houses of the 15th and 16th Districts, situated between the Gürtel and the Wienerwald, west of the city center, were all built at the same time as the Ringstraße; but today, housing conditions are very poor. Nevertheless, amid the hills of Ottakring, you will find some beautiful old villas, including Schloss Wilhelminenberg.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">17th, 18th & 19th Districts: Hernals, Währing & Döbling</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Beyond the Gürtel and towards the Vienna Woods north of the center, the villas get bigger, the surroundings greener and the streets more splendid the further you go. In these districts, you will have ample opportunities for relaxing walks in the woods, and also find beautiful <em>Heurigen</em> (traditional Austrian wine taverns), especially in Grinzing and Neustift am Walde. Vienna\''s greatest and most beautiful public swimming pool, the Krapfenwaldlbad, is situated in Döbling and offers a wonderful view over the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">20th District: Brigittenau</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Named after the 17th-century Brigittakapelle, much of the land on which this district sits was claimed from the Donau River after its containment in 1870. Around 1900, the 20th District was divided off of the larger 2nd District to become Vienna\''s last. Brigittenau lacks the historical attractions of many of the other districts, but is home to the high-rise spectacle that is the Millennium Tower, and Hannover Market.<p dir=\"ltr\"></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">21st, 22nd & 23rd District: Floridsdorf, Donaustadt & Liesing</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Viennese call the districts Floridsdorf and Donaustadt Transdanubien (beyond the Danube) because they are situated on the other side of the riverbank, east of the city center. Here, you will find Vienna\''s most popular recreational area, the Donauinsel. This is a very narrow, very long, artificial island in the river Danube—a paradise for rollerblading, cycling, jogging and walking. Liesing, which sits to the south of the city center, is huge with its small detached houses, council block buildings and some fine wine bars. Villages such as Mauer and Atzgersdorf are part of the 23rd district. They are so rural that it is sometimes hard to believe you are still in Vienna.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Warsaw\''s districts suffered along with the rest of the city\''s inhabitants during the dark days of the Second World War. Completely flattened, most of the city was rebuilt at about the same speed and at roughly the same time, with architectural styles and trends appearing in every district simultaneously.Starting from the north, on the left, and predominant side of the river, Warsaw has three main districts. They are Zoliborz (the most northerly), Centrum and Mokotow. The other side of the river (the east side) is referred to in its entirety as Praga. Within these areas, there are numerous smaller districts, whose nooks and crannies are usually only known by long-time locals.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

It is massive and beautiful and the standards of performance are very high. Also an excellent choice is Roma, or the popular Warsaw Chamber Opera. The Philharmonic is home to performers from around the world, as is the Lutoslawski Concert Studio of the Polish Radio. A diverse music scene is also nurtured at Klub Stodola, a longstanding concert venue in the city. More intimate classical performances can be seen at the Frederic Chopin Music Academy. The concert hall at the Royal Castle is a charming location to see great performances. It\''s also worth keeping an eye out for performances in some of the acoustically ideal churches.Another wonderful venue to see and hear classical music is in Lazienki Park, at the open-air Chopin piano recitals in the Rose Garden. Pianists from around the world come to play here during the summer months.If you\''re after jazz, blues or rock and roll, there are many local clubs that feature different acts on a regular basis. Try Proxima or Lolek and see what\''s on.One of the city\''s best-kept secrets is the so-called Dom Kultury (House of Culture) or Osrodek Kultury (Cultural Center) that can be found in every neighborhood. Often, these places are hives of artistic and creative activity and put on regular performances by well-known entertainers.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theaters and Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are plenty of movie theaters in Warsaw. These range from huge Socialist old-timers, to brand new high-tech cineplexes. Some of the favorite cinemas are Capitol, a former Soviet cultural center, Muranow, which often shows alternative films, and Atlantic, also right downtown.Warsaw has a very active and diverse theater scene. Performances of everything from puppets to classics can be seen here. The National Theatre (opened in 1765) is where the grandest productions take place. Ateneum offers modern favorites, Dramatyczny covers Shakespeare to Beckett, Guliwer has puppets and live actors, Komedia offers comic plays and Zydowski puts on Jewish performances.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For those looking to dance until the small hours, Warsaw has an ever-growing selection of venues. Harenda has a mellower, more bar-like mood and Riviera Remont hosts lots of live acts and is popular with students. Proxima is a great place for dancing and live music with a young crowd, while Niebo hosts a variety of both live and DJ performances. Other popular spots around town include the Bank Club, the Space Club and Club Mirage.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoors</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For those who like sports, there are swimming pools such as the new Wodny Park or the outdoor Moczydlo. Evening ice-skating is on offer at Tor Stegny and Torwar II.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city also has some great museums. These range from the traditional —like the National Museum—to the less conventional such as the Warsaw Gasworks Museum. The Museum of Measurement is unique and very interesting while the Chopin Museum is also a favorite. The POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews, located on the historic site of the Warsaw Ghetto, pays respect to the city\''s Jews and their rich culture, whereas the Warsaw Rising Museum chronicles the history of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. For families traveling with kids, the Copernicus Science Centre is a fun way to learn a thing or two, and the quirky Neon Museum, with a fascinating cornucopia of more than 60 vintage signage from the Cold War era makes for an incredibly interesting visit.  Warsaw\''s flourishing art scene can also be seen post the city\''s renaissance, with a series of artistic exhibitions cropping up at a multitude of galleries in the city. Bringing to the fore the region\''s most talented graphic and poster artists is the Galeria Grafiki i Plakatu, while the Galeria aTak owned by the Polish Modern Art Foundation showcases an impressive line-up of regional artists. Galeria Raster, the Galeria Foksal, and the Center for Contemporary Art in the Ujazdowski Castle are also worth exploring.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals and Events</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the advantages of living in the capital city is that there are many celebrations and holidays which you can participate in. Warsaw hosts parades, concerts and special events on a regular basis. There are also some excellent annual festivals, such as the Warsaw Summer Jazz Days, the Mozart Festival, and many others. Another excellent option is to stroll through one of the wonderful and majestic parks, such as Lazienki or Wilanow. These peaceful green spaces are self-contained entertainment complexes, with museums, sculptured gardens, concert stages, cafés and restaurants. Above all, these offer the visitor the perfect opportunity to relax and unwind.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (2157,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sródmiescie</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sródmiescie is the main area of interest for visitors to Warsaw as it includes the central business district, the fashionable shopping of Nowy Swiat, the Old Town and much of the Royal Route. The central business district, commonly known as Centrum, is a rushing hive of activity that shows the eruption of modernity in Warsaw in recent decades. Amid the skyscrapers you can still find history, and the best place to see it all is at the viewing terrace at the top of the Palace of Culture. From there you can see a birds-eye view of the city in its rushing madness below. Marszalkowska Street, built in 1757, meets Jerozolimskie, at what could be called Poland\''s main crossroads. From there, the opera, theaters, shops and restaurants can all be reached by hopping on one of the many red and yellow trams that criss-cross the busy downtown boulevards. Further to the north, you will find Old Town (Stare Miasto) along the banks of the Vistula River. There you can experience the Warsaw of medieval times as you stroll within the walled city reconstructed according to historical records following its complete destruction in the Second World War. Leading up to the Old Town is the Royal Route, a beautiful stretch of wide avenue lined with villas and the high-end boutiques of Nowy Swiat marking the road the king used to travel to his summer palace in Lazienki Royal Park. Nowadays this park is not only incorporated into the city, but is a favorite spot in Warsaw for residents and tourists alike, as well as a glorious place to spend an entire day.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Zoliborz</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Zoliborz, often called \''green Zoliborz\'', suffered less than the other districts during the war. In fact, this is where many of the participants of the failed Warsaw Uprising escaped to, once they realized all hope was lost. In certain parts it retains a peaceful suburban atmosphere, with interesting-looking houses and groups of flats surrounding parks and open spaces. Zoliborz is also home to the grave of the now world-famous priest, Jerzy Popieluszko, who was murdered by the secret police in 1984 for his opposition to the communist regime. Old Zoliborz meets new Zoliborz at Plac Wilsona, named for President Woodrow Wilson, which under Soviet rule following World War II was officially renamed the Square of the Paris Commune. However, none of the locals ever called it that: to taxi drivers and residents it always remained Wilson Square. Zoliborz is an extremely pleasant neighborhood with its large parks and leafy tree-lined streets.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mokotow</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Continuing south, the next district is Mokotow. This large area has several different feels to it: some beautiful pre-war mansions still remain standing (now occupied by businesses or embassies), as well as some typically Socialist rows of dull gray apartment blocks. Five of Warsaw\''s institutes of higher education are found in this district, including the Warsaw Polytechnic University and the School of Economics. There are also large areas of green, including large parks that interconnect. Access to the city\''s single subway line is also here.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wola</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the west of these three districts, still on the left side of the Vistula, you will find Wola. This district is predominantly the site of corporate office parks and emerging housing developments, but amidst these campuses you will find many historical sites worth visiting. Wola is primarily an industrial area that is seeing some revival. Amidst the old factories, you can find several museums such as the Warsaw Gasworks Museum, the Wola Museum, and the must-see Warsaw Uprising Museum. This district also bears the sad history of being built on the site of the former Jewish Ghetto, where you can visit sites of historical tragedy such as the Jewish Cemetery (Cmentarz Zydowski), the Monument to Heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto and the Umschlagplatz where a memorial stands to all Jews deported to Nazi extermination camps.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Praga</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The other side of the river (the east side) is commonly referred to as Praga, infamous as the place where the Soviet Red Army was stationed and stood in wait as the Germans crushed the 63-day Warsaw Uprising and Hitler vowed to erase the city off the map in retribution just before the end of the Second World War. It was only after the Germans were defeated that the Soviets crossed over to reclaim Warsaw. For this reason, Praga was spared much of the war\''s destruction and a historical tension developed between the right and left banks of the river. Praga has a slightly dubious reputation among locals for crime, dangerous streets, the Mafia, car theft and so on. Although this is true in large part in only a few specific areas, they have seen dramatic improvement in the last few years. Popular among artists for the low rent available in this district, Praga has become home to many studios and workshops for the new avant-garde. Cafes, pubs and clubs are popping up to cater to Warsaw\''s bohemian crowd. Saska Kepa is an upper-class haven running down to the riverbanks. Its narrow tree-lined streets are wonderful to walk through and admire the villas that were once home to Tsarist ministers. Now these structures instead belong to private owners, embassies and international schools. Prominent landmarks in Praga include the Galeria Wileñska, a sprawling shopping center, the Museum of Praga, and the Warsaw Printing Museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ursynow</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ursynow is another area that has gained a degree of infamy. A massive and sprawling example of Socialist planning, it emerged as block after characterless block of gray, dull flats. However, this area too is changing with the times. New shops and services are opening up, cinemas and entertainment complexes have arrived, restaurants and community centers are active and busy, and there are plenty new schools. This once depressingly gray and dull area is finally coming to life, and its future looks bright, especially since the metro cuts right through it.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wilanow</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Running alongside Ursynow, beside the river, is Wilanow. Most visitors to Warsaw will want to come out here to visit the renowned Royal Palace, built in the style of Versailles. The area around Wilanow is picturesque, especially the roads that lead down to the Vistula River. The Temple of Divine Providence and the Museum of John Paul II and Primate Wyszyñski are two other landmarks located here.  For an outsider, it may be hardl to appreciate the subtleties that distinguish many of Warsaw\''s districts. With time, they are slowly taking on new character. However, Warsaw\''s original districts were a casualty of the Second World War. As the city continues the rapid development that began soon after the fall of communism and was accelerated by Poland\''s joining the European Union, its districts are coming back to life with a vitality that is evident to any visitor. Being able to witness the transformation is part of what makes Warsaw such an interesting place.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Kennedy Center is a showcase for theater, both old and new, encompassing seven venues which include the Eisenhower Theater, the Concert Hall, KC Jazz Club, the Opera House, Family Theater, Theater Lab and Terrace Theater. The National Theatre is Washington\''s answer to Broadway, presenting many touring companies and occasionally premiering musicals before they move on to the Great White Way in New York City. The Warner Theater has a multifaceted past. It opened in the 1920s as a vaudeville house, became a classic movie palace and then a venue for rock bands before closing its doors. Reopened in 1992, it now features big name plays and other entertainment acts. Another historic theater is Ford\''s Theatre, which has carefully preserved the 1865 scene where President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. Plays are produced on the same stage onto which John Wilkes Booth jumped after delivering the fatal shot. A visit to the theater is both a historic and cultural experience. The Arena Stage and the Gunston Arts Center are two of the more eclectic and innovative theaters in the Washington area dedicated to the celebration of the dramatic arts. They both offer programs to educate and inform as well as entertain.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Movie theaters throughout the metropolitan area show the latest offerings from Hollywood and international studios.

This grand stage is the home of the Washington Opera, which performs seven operas in their November-March season, all in their original languages with English subtitles. The National Symphony Orchestra calls the Kennedy Center home as well, performing in the Concert Hall from September—June. In the summer, the acclaimed orchestra can be heard at Wolf Trap Farm Park and playing from the steps of the U.S. Capitol on special holidays. Lisner Auditorium at George Washington University is another venue for classical music, often showcasing lesser-known works. Outdoor concerts are popular in the warmer months when Washingtonians and visitors enjoy picnics and listen to free music on the National Mall, in Rock Creek Park or at the National Zoo. The official bands of the U.S. Armed Forces often host concerts featuring both patriotic and popular tunes. The city has many venues for popular and contemporary music acts as well. Jiffy Lube Live brings in big name artists for summer outdoor concerts, while Constitution Hall and the Nightclub 9:30 host year-round shows featuring a variety of rock and roll, jazz, blues and pop acts.Washington\''s international makeup provides a variety of music from around the world.

Habana Village offers Latin dance lessons before the evening gets under way. The club has three floors for dancers doing the salsa and tango. The Spanish Ballroom at Glen Echo Park, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, offers lessons and dances throughout the week in a variety of styles including Cajun and swing. There is also an elegant Sunday afternoon tea dance which often features waltzes. Contemporary dance clubs are numerous in the Metro area, many staying open until the wee hours of the morning.

A range of cultural institutions befitting the capital of the United States, Washington\''s line-up includes the staggering collections of the Smithsonian Institution and its 19 museums, galleries and zoo that line the National Mall. Besides these, museums like the International Spy Museum have also garnered much acclaim despite stiff competition from the city\''s federally funded institutions.As for art, while the Smithsonian\''s Hirshhorn Museum, National Art Gallery, and National Museum of African Art are at the top the list of Washington\''s best, more intimate venues abound as well. ConnerSmith showcases the work of cutting-edge, contemporary artists, the Phillips Collection dazzles with its cache of modern Art, and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and Freer Gallery display stellar works of Asian Art.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Activities</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For a city as rich in culture as this, Washington DC also boasts an impressive array of outdoor activities to enjoy. There are ample trails and scenic parks, as well as a renown zoo and arboretum to explore.

From late March to early April, tourists descend on the Tidal Basin from near and far to witness the blooming cherry trees, gifted to the city by Yukio Ozaki in 1912. While the blooms are the main attraction of the National Cherry Blossom Festival, there are also a variety of art and cultural events to partake in.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

With its large central fountain and shade trees, the circle is a great place to sit and watch the crowds or enjoy lunch.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Foggy Bottom</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once called Funkstown (after a German immigrant), Foggy Bottom derived its name during the late 19th Century when smoke from the neighborhood factories and the swampy air of the low ground combined to produce a permanent fog along the waterfront. Today the neighborhood has an institutional and bureaucratic air to it. It\''s the home of the Department of State, the Kennedy Center and George Washington University.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Georgetown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Trendy, fashionable and fun describe the atmosphere in Georgetown, Washington\''s oldest neighborhood.

A close second for Wellington\''s arts attractions is the City Gallery, one of the most proactive and evocative fine arts museums in New Zealand. Other interesting exhibitions can be found at the birthplace of Katherine Mansfield, the Wellington Museum and the Dowse Art Museum.

Restaurants, cafes, wine bars and pubs line both sides of this long, wide strip. A good spread of ethnic tastes is evident in their many and varied menus.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cuba Street</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For the young urban dweller, Cuba Street is one of the city\''s prime locations in which to see and be seen. Street theater and busking are common, especially during the Fringe Festival. This area also boasts innovative sculptures and water features that impart a colorful sense of creativity. Contributing further to this vibrant atmosphere is the phenomenal concentration of cafés and shopping boutiques on Cuba Street. There is something to suit every mood and palate.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Golden Mile/Waterfront</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For the sophisticated shopper, Wellington\''s so-called \"Golden Mile\" shopping district provides endless opportunities for spending. The entire length of Lambton Quay and the Willis Street area is home to a number of shopping malls. Some of the more popular ones include Lambton Square, Capital on the Quay, and the tasteful Old Bank Arcade.  There are plenty of eating options here too, including the always crowded Caffe Astoria. Watch out for the suit brigade as you pound the pavements, particularly between noon and 2p when the surrounding office blocks, affectionately known as Wellington\''s filing cabinets, empty their drawers for lunch. Wellington\''s waterfront is one of the most accessible in the country—cycle paths and numerous parks span the full length of the inner-city harbor from Queen\''s Wharf to Oriental Parade. The area is a popular weekend destination for families and young people with activities and attractions to cater for all interests. There is also the jewel in the museum crown, the majestic Te Papa Tongarewa that gracefully stands on the water\''s edge. Facing Lambton Harbor, there are numerous restaurants and drinking establishments that uphold the neighborhood\''s unofficial \''golden Mile\'' title. There are plenty of options for dining that span cuisines, cooking techniques, ambiance, with the sweeping views of the marina common to all. Not far from this legion of restaurants and cafes is the Wellington Museum on Jervois Quay and the TSB Bank Arena.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Civic Square</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Civic Square was developed in the early 1990s and forms a natural boundary between the Cuba Street and Lambton Quay shopping precincts. A marvelous open area that incorporates clever landscaping, it is popular with the lunch time crowds in summer and is a regular venue for outdoor festivals and markets. Also, the square is surrounded by cultural institutions. These include the Wellington City Library, City Gallery and the Wellington Festival and Convention Centre that incorporates the Town Hall and Michael Fowler Centre. The nearby waterfront is easily accessible from the square via the architecturally well-designed City to Sea Bridge.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mt Victoria & Oriental Bay</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mt Victoria\''s colorful Victorian villas present a picture of island elegance perched precariously on the edge of this bush-clad hillside. The city\''s hilly terrain, unfamiliar to the original surveyors, has resulted in some eccentric yet delightful streetscapes. Keep an eye out for footpaths that are, in fact, narrow-winding streets, and for private cable cars that provide access to some of the more remote hilltop homes. The Southern Walkway rambles through the bush to emerge at the top of Mt Victoria for spectacular 360-degree views of the city. At its foot, tree-lined streets frame the pleasant inner-city suburbs of Mt Victoria and Oriental Bay. The Government House is located here here, as are some of the finest restaurants that are subtly tucked away in nooks and crannies throughout the area. The Mount Victoria Lookout is an observation deck that offers stunning views of the bay as well as the cityscape. Plenty of breezy cafes and brunch restaurants line the street facing the bay, particularly popular with bathers that swim at the adjacent Freyberg Pool.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Thorndon</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A quaint mix of old and new characterizes this upmarket inner-city suburb. One of the oldest areas of the city, it was divided by a motorway extension in the 1970s that ripped through the middle of the Bolton Street Cemetery. Although the motorway has changed the landscape, the colonial charm of Thordon survives in the narrow backstreets that can be explored on foot. Ascot Street and Sydney Street West are two streets that provide the finest examples of colonial cottages but there are numerous other architectural gems to be found along the main suburban axis, Tinakori Road.  Historic Thorndon is rich in architectural and cultural attractions. Katherine Mansfield\''s Birthplace can be visited on Tinakori Road and the magnificent Old St Paul\''s should not be missed. Do not confuse it with its newer and larger neighbor, St Paul\''s Cathedral.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Eastbourne</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just across the water from the city center lies the pleasant waterside settlement of Eastbourne—it is only a short crossing by ferry. Days Bay is a popular destination for families and sun seekers in summer. This area is also conveniently located near several excellent reserves and walking areas including Butterfly Creek and the Pencarrow Lighthouse. The unrestricted views from the lighthouse across Wellington City and the harbor entrance are truly magnificent.  As home to the New Zealand government, Wellington offers a delightful mix of tradition and modernity.

Whitehall, now the Flagler Museum, set the standard for other members of Henry Flagler\''s social and financial standing who followed him south. Constructed in the popular Beaux Arts architectural style in 1902 on six acres, Whitehall was a 55-room, 60,000 square foot vacation house. Open now to public tours, it offers a glimpse into the lifestyle of American millionaires of that period. At the age of 72, Mr. Flagler presented this multi-million dollar gift to his new bride and third wife, complete with European works of art, Roman sculptures, enormous ballroom with gilded mirrors, and gold china service and porcelain. When the wealthy came south to partake of Florida\''s warm climate at the turn of the century, they had money to spend, of course.

The Prairie Theatre Exchange, located on the third floor of the popular Portage Place mall, showcases local talent and has a drama school. Other theaters in the Exchange District include the Walker Theatre and Pantages Playhouse Theatre. The Gas Station Theatre in Osborne Village, a walk through which is entertainment in itself, features amateurs taking to stage. The Manitoba Theatre for Young People is in The Forks, where there is a Select-A-Seat office that brokers for most of the production companies in town. The Main stage at The Forks Market is host to concerts, featuring local and imported talent. Twenty minutes north of downtown, at Kildonan Park, visitors will find the lovely outdoor venue, the Rainbow Stage, which offers Broadway style shows all summer, and takes their troupe to Pantages in winter. Movie theaters downtown are distributed almost as tightly as the production houses. In the outlying regions they are found in most major malls. Those folks into art films will find their needs met at Cinematheque in the Exchange, where you can watch independent films for a small fee. Not far from the University of Winnipeg, the Dramatic Arts Centre is a gem hosting a plethora of live theater productions, musicals, and film screenings.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums and Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A person strolling through the core of Winnipeg couldn\''t walk four blocks without encountering a museum or gallery of some form or another. Downtown houses the majors, with the Museum of Man and Nature/Planetarium/Concert Hall complex located just north of Portage and Main, and the Winnipeg Art Gallery a short trip up Portage at Memorial Boulevard. Near The Forks, the Canadian Museum for Human Rights dominates the neighborhood skyline with its striking architecture and piques interest with its evocative exhibits. Nearby, the Manitoba\''s Children Museum is a great way to explore and learn scientific and technical principles, a prized family-friendly gem for those traveling with young ones. Osborne Village and Little Italy have an amazing number of galleries clustered together. Winnipeg\''s modern spirit feeds largely on a wealth of contemporary art that several of the city\''s spaces display. From modern takes on Aboriginal art at the Urban Shaman gallery, to the hip Graffiti Gallery that promotes youth artists, there is a lot to keep an arts lover occupied in the city. Both the core and outlying regions in the city house smaller museums, such as the Transcona Historical Museum, which celebrates the neighborhood\''s railroad past. Some must-see attractions outside of town include Lower Fort Garry near Selkirk, the only intact stone fort construct in North America, and the Mennonite Heritage Museum in Steinbach, a mock-up of a nineteenth-century Mennonite village.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Live music can be found almost anywhere, and in almost any genre.

Those inclined toward equestrian sports can cheer their favorite thoroughbred at the Assiniboia Downs Racetrack up on Portage Avenue.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals & Cultural Events</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mentioning a few and not all seems unfair, but Winnipeg has some biggies that should be pointed out. The Winnipeg Folk Festival, held in the spacious Bird\''s Hill Park & Campground, is a weekend of music, crafts and outdoor fun for the whole family. Folklorama, a weeklong celebration of ethnic diversity, is the largest of its kind in the world.

 (2195,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown Winnipeg</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The famous intersection of Portage Avenue and Main Street at the head of the Exchange District was the original site of commercial development in the city. It is still a main trade area, with the major banks holding offices in the city\''s numerous skyscrapers. Urban renewal is rampant in this city, with many of the historical buildings preserved; most are within walking distance of the downtown attractions and hotels. On Downtown\''s arterial Main Street, a sea of prime landmarks and entertainment centers jostle for space, from the City Hall and the beaux-arts splendor of Union Station, to the Manitoba Centennial Centre and the Winnipeg Railway Museum.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Exchange District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A National Historic Site, the Exchange District is the epicenter of commerce and economy in the city - the site where commodity exchanges flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The area still houses the the original grain exchange and Old Market Square. While the market has since moved to The Forks Market, the Exchange is still a gathering and learning place. As the cornerstone of Winnipeg\''s prosperous economy, this district is also home to an arsenal of heritage, turn-of-the-century buildings and landmarks that contribute to a wondrous architectural legacy. A medley of old-time granaries, financial establishments and sky-rise structures greets anyone who walks into this historic district, as do landmarks that belong to the city\''s theatrical heritage - the Centennial Concert Hall and Artspace.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Forks</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Now a stunning riverside sprawl, The Forks was the erstwhile transportation intersection for indigenous Aboriginals, before the Europeans arrived. A vibrant home for arts, history and culture, this neighborhood is one of the most definitive gathering places for both locals and tourists looking for a good time in the city. This place has everything. Sports fans will appreciate the close proximity of CanWest Global Baseball Park, where Winnipeg\''s Goldeyes play pro-ball. Pasta lovers will find the Old Spaghetti Factory enjoyable. More artistic travelers will find that the Manitoba Theatre for Young People provides excellent entertainment, and the Manitoba Children\''s Museum and Explore Manitoba Centre are great stops for the family. Also found at The Forks is the Assiniboine River Walk, a paved walk along the scenic banks of this historic river. The Paddlewheel River Rouge Tours depart from here, as well as at the Paddlewheel docks, just a jaunt away at the base of the Provencher Bridge.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Old Saint Boniface</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spanning the Red River going east on Provencher takes the traveler into Old St. B, as it is known locally. This is the largest French-speaking community in western Canada. Just beyond the bridge is St. Boniface Basilica and the adjoining stone archway. These make a very pretty sight, especially from across the river. A short distance further up Provencher visitors will find the Centre Culturel Franco-Manitobaine, a hall dedicated to the promotion of French entertainment arts.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Transcona</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Moving further from the downtown area, one can visit Transcona, an older area at the eastern limits of town known for its railroad history. This area became part of the city in the early 1970\''s, and planners there promptly set up the Transcona Historical Museum. A colossal steam locomotive, proudly exhibited at the Kiwanis Park, is the marker of the Grand Trunk Railway line that has been operating from the city since the 19th Century. Here you will find the Club Regent Casino, and numerous bars and clubs. About twenty minutes out of town, visitors can enjoy such exciting outdoor amusements as Fun Mountain Waterslide Park, Grand Prix Amusements and Tinkertown Family Fun Park. TC, as Transcona is locally known, also has the longest auto sales strip in the city, where car shoppers can find anything from a Porsche to a RV.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North West</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just north of the Airport are several attractions including the Western Canada Aviation Museum. McPhillips Street Station Casino is a great destination for the gambler who is a railway buff. Nearby is the Prairie Dog Central Living Museum; this historic locomotive takes tours west of the city with stops at Grosse Isle, where tourists are regaled with local hospitality. McPhillips is the highway one would take north to the wilderness adventure, Oak Hammock Marsh Interpretive Centre, and farther north to the beaches of Manitoba\''s vast inland lakes.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">St. James/Assiniboia and Unicity</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">These areas cut a swath along Portage Avenue from just beyond downtown all the way out of the city. Along the way, travelers will find the Polo Park, shopping behemoth and Manitoba\''s largest shopping center housing nearly 200 stores. This vast shopping complex is even bigger than downtown\''s Portage Place. The Winnipeg International Airport is nearby, as is Air Force Heritage Park & Museum. Across from Polo Park is the historic bridge of Saint James across the river that leads to the Assiniboine Park Zoo. At the western limit of town are the areas known as Unicity and Charleswood.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Moving south from Confusion Corner, the confluence of Osborne and Donald Streets, Pembina Highway and Corydon Avenue, is an area called Little Italy. Little Italy, like Osborne Village, is filled with al fresco cafes, ice cream parlors, galleries and specialty shops. Pembina Highway moves south through Fort Rouge, Fort Garry, Fort Richmond, and finally St. Norbert, at the southern limit of town. Just south of here visitors can view the Provincial Heritage Park and the Red River Floodway, where gates divert floodwater into a sluiceway flowing around Winnipeg. Going farther south will get you to Victory Lanes Speedway, and the Morris Stampede.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South West</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">St. Vital and St. Boniface do not have a lot in the way of attractions, but one can find some spacious recreational parks along the Red River and some well-appointed shopping malls, such as St. Vital Centre. These areas are on fast-moving highways with easy access out of town on the east side. A couple of these routes take you past the Royal Canadian Mint (at Fermor and Lagimodiere), where all of Canada\''s coins are made.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Heading out Main Street, visitors can see the Holy Trinity Ukranian-Orthodox Cathedral, a beautiful historic church that is of interest to those of theological, historical or architectural bent. Kildonan Park is a great picnic area and rest stop, with outdoor pools and plenty of park area along the Red. This park houses Rainbow Stage, which hosts all manner of theatrical troupes. Main Street can be taken north to the lakes, and a quick jaunt east on the Perimeter Highway will connect you with the highway to Bird\''s Hill Provincial Park and Campground, where the internationally acclaimed Winnipeg Folk Festival is held every year.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (2298,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whatever your taste - Classical, Jazz, Blues, Punk Rock or Funk - it\''ll be catered to here, and often for free. Bath has a surprising number of classical music groups and orchestras, and not a week passes without several possible performances. The biggest festival in town is the Bath International Music Festival, usually running from the last week in May to the first in June. This is truly an international festival and runs concurrently with the Jazz Festival and the Fringe Festival, so it\''s an eclectic mixture. Unmissable though, is the first night, which kicks off festivities with a free modern music concert in Victoria Park, just below the Royal Crescent. In the evening, street lighting from the Circus to the Royal Crescent is normally turned off and the windows candle lit, while the climax comes with a stunning firework display over the Crescent. Bath\''s biggest party night, and always memorable.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Theatre and Cinema</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For theatre buffs, no trip to Bath would be complete without a visit to the Theatre Royal. As it was built in 1805 and has recently been refurbished, this Georgian gem also qualifies as one of the sights of Bath, but the fare on offer stands on its own merit. The program changes weekly, with one-off performances on Sunday by a wide variety of performers, but the play is the thing here and they are top class. The National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and (usually once each year) the Royal Ballet, are regular visitors and many plays close their pre-West End national tours here. If they don\''t go down well in Bath they might not make it to London. Equally, there are many post-West End touring plays as well. If this sounds pricey don\''t forget that fifty seats are sold at midday for much less and if you call in just before the evening performance, cut-price seats and returns are normally for sale at half price. If a performance is sold out then standing only tickets are available (just turn up, they can\''t be reserved). Leaning against the rail is quite comfortable, there\''s a great view, and you\''ll be first at the bar during the interval. Behind the Theatre Royal, but in the same building, is the intimate Ustinov Studio where more avant-garde material is performed and there\''s also the amateur-run Rondo Theatre at Larkhall. The Rondo program is not quite so regular but the standard is high and the bar is next to the raked seating area so you can drink as you watch. Bath still doesn\''t have a vast multi-screen cinema, just a couple of small cinemas like the Little Theatre by the Cross and Hot Baths. The \''little\'' is worth a mention. Built in 1935, it was used for drama courses as well as cinema, and the owners also owned the renowned Everyman in London. It is the oldest private cinema in the country still in the hands of the original family, a fact which allows the slightly more fringe and foreign films to be shown. And there\''s a front of house manager who is not only over the age of nineteen, but he doesn\''t chew gum either and is quite happy to discuss the movies on offer with a modicum of insight. And it\''s comfortable, with big seats and the latest sound system.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sport</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To many people, \''sport\'' in Bath means only one thing: rugby. In the amateur days, Bath was the undisputed champion of the country, but professionalism arrived after 1996, and since then things aren\''t quite what they used to be. Nevertheless, Rugby rules and the Rec (Recreation Ground, next to the river opposite Parade Gardens) is the most picturesque setting for any stadium in the country, if not the world. Entry prices may not be cheap but it\''s free entry for second team games and the overlooking clubhouse bar is open to all, so a pleasant evening can be had for the price of a pint. While the rugby season runs from September to May, the other crowd-pulling sport in Bath, Horse racing at Lansdown, handily fills in by having a May to September season. All the top jockeys and trainers come to this scenic track and entry prices are lower, with children under 16 admitted free. Before some die-hard football fan screams foul, it\''s best to mention Bath City Football at Twerton.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Otherwise</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Buskers abound on the streets around the Abbey and many are worth watching. At night the nightlife scene comes to life and bars like The Canary Gin Bar, Sub 13, and The Dark Horse invite patrons to linger over their drinks. The various Walks, Ghost, Comedy, etc. can be fun, but there\''s no better value than the free Mayor\''s Walk starting from outside the Pump Room twice daily.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (2299,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">City Centre</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rarely can you find so much to see and do in such a small geographical area as in Bath Centre. World class museums, including the Roman Baths and the internationally renowned Museum of Costume, are so numerous that little gems such as the Postal Museum are easily overlooked. An important site of historical and cultural origins, the Centre is home to Bath Abbey, site of over 1,600 years of religious activity, and the Theatre Royal is home to pre-London tours and local productions alike. Music, literature and Shakespeare Festivals highlight the busy diary of activities, and pubs, clubs and various music and comedy venues (and buskers!) are plentiful. Around every corner, you can find excellent dining options, and if you\''re bent on shopping, you can\''t go wrong; Bath has all the big names as well as a complete range of independent merchants, all within easy walking distance of one another. Both train and bus stations provide easy access to all the city has to offer.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">City Suburbs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">So you\''ve arrived in the city unannounced and to your dismay, every hotel in the City Centre is full to bursting. Don\''t despair - there is still hope. The city suburbs are the perfect place to stay when visiting the city, offering all the peace of the countryside yet only minutes from the City Centre on foot. The best place to start looking is Newbridge where every other establishment is a hotel. Take a flat walk from the city along the beautiful winding canal path and be thankful that you were foolish enough not to book ahead! Lansdown<em>: </em>Privileged living and private houses are Lansdown trademarks. Beckford\''s Tower, Lansdown Horse Racing Course and spacious playing fields are prominent sites, as well as a Ministry of Defence property. The Kingswood School and Preparatory School, and the Royal High School are popular sites for the education of ministers-to-be and antique shops litter the streets. Lansdown Park-and-Ride offers easy access alternatives into the Centre. Larkhall<em>: </em>Old village life thrives here, a short walk from the Centre. Everything you could need from delicatessen to hardware shop to the corner butcher is here, and the best part is, it\''s off the main road! The housing is a mixture of old and new and ranges across income levels, and a church-community run coffee shop is a local meeting place. Several pubs and the Rondo Theatre keep the night alive and takeaway food options abound. Oldfield Park and Bear Flat: A diverse area of Bath and just a short walk from the Centre, Oldfield Park has a wide range of housing, from the terraced housing at the lower end of Oldfield Road up through semi-detached, to the houses and private properties which figure prominently on the upper road. Moorland Road is the main shopping area in Oldfield Park and is bedecked with flowers during the summer. The Bear Pub, with the polar bear on the roof, is an easy landmark among the Bear Flat shops, and the Real Meat Company offers an excellent selection of organic and humanely raised meat. Weston and Newbridge: West of the City Centre is an area of middle-income housing and suburban shops - check out Chelsea Road for hairdressers aplenty and the best bakery in Bath. Locksbrook Cemetery is an integral part of the landscape, as is Victoria Park, a huge, safe play area for hordes of energetic children. Pubs and eateries can be found in this area. Also located here is the Royal United Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in the Avon region.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outside the City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bath\''s and North East Somerset\''s (B&NES) main geographical feature is the river Avon which, with the Kennet and Avon canal, has formed a historically important base for industry as it curls through the hills on its way to the mouth of the Severn at Bristol. Bath is the centerpiece for visitors, though many opportunities in more rural settings lie waiting to be discovered. The county is also home to Newton St. Loe, a quaint old village with properties and lands owned and maintained by the Prince of Wales. Bradford-on-Avon<em>:</em> This one-time home to wool, cloth, and rubber industries, eight miles from Bath, Bradford-on-Avon\''s central landmark is the ancient bridge over the Avon. The Saxon town is bordered by the Kennet and Avon Canal and is packed with listed buildings, including a well-preserved Saxon church. Industrial works are still an important feature, as are large recreation grounds and several golf courses. Opportunities to visit small historical houses and sites are plentiful. The town is certainly worthy of further exploration. Corsham:<em> </em>Located in the county of Wiltshire and about six miles northeast of Bath, Corsham is a historic market town with a quaint pedestrian shopping area including some quaint specialty shops. Housing is varied with some new developments. Pubs include the Northey Arms on the outskirts, and the Hare and Hounds in the Centre; the Methuen Arms Hotel provides central accommodation. The town is bordered by Pickwick Lodge farm and a military training base. By all means stop to see historic Corsham Court, a Royal Manor in the days of Saxon Kings and surrounded by extensive landscapes cultivated by Capability Brown. Keynsham<em>:</em> Bustling with small-town energy, Keynsham is ideally positioned between Bristol and Bath. High street shops, health and garden centers serve local families and retirees. Off the high street are middle-income houses in a suburban setting; the lifestyle is relaxed. There are a number of hotels in the area suitable for those who want a quiet holiday, but for good nightlife, head to Bath or Bristol. Midsomer Norton: A surprisingly large and lively town center, Midsomer Norton boasts good shopping opportunities, including high street shops. The Mallards Pub is frequented by locals, while the Old Priory Hotel allows the visitor to experience luxury outside Bath. New housing and industrial units testify to development of the area, while old industry is represented by the Somerset and Dorset Railway Trackbed Trust. Norton Radstock:<em> </em>This old mining town between Bath and Wells has a large shopping district and lively center. The Radstock Museum offers a glimpse into local history and industry. Whether you choose to stay within the city itself or choose a base in a more rural location, you can be assured of a warm welcome and the kind of hospitality that has become a trademark of the West Country.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

In order to visit the most important ones, you should buy the \"<em>Boleto Turístico</em>,\" or tourist pass.  The most important museum is probably the Museo Inka of Pre-Hispanic culture, located one block from the Plaza de Armas. The building was once the residence of the Marques de Vallumbrioso and housed the best library in the new world. One block further on is the Plaza Nazarenas, where you can find the Casa Cabrera with its permanent exhibition of works by the famous photographer Martín Chambi. Next to the Plaza de Armas, is the Plaza Regocijo and the Casa Garcilaso museum with its exhibition of colonial art. Here you will also find the Contemporary Art Museum. Other notable museums like the Museo de Arte Precolombino and Museo de Sitio de Qoricancha proudly exhibits archaeological objects, Pre-Columbian artworks, and offers glimpses of the city\''s storied Inca heritage.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the neighborhood of San Blas, a special gallery of interest is the Museo Hilario Mendívil, where the visitor can see artisanal handicrafts made by techniques handed down through the generations. Other galleries of note include the gallery of the Escuela de Bellas Artes, and the Museo Maximo Laura, a colorful repository of the Peruvian tapestry collection.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the Centro Qosqo de Arte Nativo on Avenida El Sol, there is a daily show of the region\''s folk dances which has been running for more than 25 years. After watching the performance, head to some of the clubs and discos in Cusco, particularly on Procuradores Street. Some of the longest running places are the Ukuku\''s and Mama Africa, both of which are pubs with great drinks, good music and lots of spontaneity. Other popular bars include La Chupitería, Paddy\''s Irish Pub and Norton Rat\''s Tavern.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Incan civilization centered on religious tradition and culture, so there is no doubt that these traditions remained. Some have reconciled with Spanish rituals and ceremonies but nonetheless many processions are still to be found in Cusco today. Corpus Christi is one such festival, it used to be an Incan ritual to carry the exhumed bodies of priests throughout the village, but since the arrival of the Spanish, it is now an homage to various saints. The festival of Quyllurit\''ii, which means \"Snow Star\" was originally an Incan veneration to nature, yet once again transformed and is now more Catholic. Inti Raymi or the Sun Festival is a very important holiday for the people of Cusco. The ceremony is spoken entirely in Quecha and draws thousands to the Sacsayhuam fortress.  A festival that celebrates crosses and agriculture is Cruz Velakuy, paying homage to another harvest and a reverence to the goddess <em>Pachamama</em>, or mother nature.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (2375,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Centro Histórico</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The best way to make the most of all the attractions in Cusco is to purchase the <em>boleto turistico</em> or \"tourist ticket\" with which you can access all the important cultural and historical museums and churches. In the center of the city is the Plaza de Armas, which was reputedly designed by the Inca Manco Capac. It is also called <em>Aucaypata</em>, which in Quechua means \"warrior square.\" In the square stands the splendid La Catedral, which took 94 years to build. Next to this are the chapels Capilla de la Sagrada Familia in its restored form, and the Capilla del Triunfo whose walls are adorned with masterpieces from the Cusco School, including works by Diego Quispe Tito. Ten minutes from the Plaza de Armas is Santo Domingo, and the stunning, extravagant Korikancha, or Templo del Sol (\"Temple of the Sun\"), believed to have once been covered with gold. In front of the temple is the historic \"Casa de los Cuatro Bustos\". Descending toward Avenida El Sol, you can get another view of the Korikancha and visit the museum. The Compañía de Jesús, pride of the Jesuit order, is also located in the Plaza de Armas, a block away in Calle Hatun Rumiyoq. This houses the Palacio del Arzobispado, which has some valuable works of art. On this same street, you can observe the famous rock with 12 angles, which was a part of the Inca Roca\''s palace. From here, it is recommended to go towards the San Blas neighborhood, one of Cusco\''s most picturesque areas.Towards the center again, on Calle Mantas, stands La Merced, which houses La Custodia, a grandiose colonial-era sculpture in solid gold one meter high. The Casa Garcilaso has a large collection of Pre-Hispanic and colonial art, and in San Francisco, there is the temple of the same name, with one of the largest paintings in Latin America.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">San Blas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Formerly known as <em>Toqocachi</em> (Salt Cave), it was due to the works of artists Mendivil, Olave and Merida that this neighborhood came to be known as the artisans district. Barrio de San Blas is a unique, picturesque area that has recently been restored. When walking through the quaint streets of this magical neighborhood, you can easily imagine yourself in the 19th Century. The church of San Blas has an enormous wooden pulpit carved from a single piece of wood by the Inca artist and architect Tomas Tuyro Tupac.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Urumbaba</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Along the Urubamba river, which means \"flat land of spiders\", you will find the Sacred Valley of the Incas, once the domain where the Inca flourished. The valley is 26 miles long and is a way station for visitors on their trek to Machu Picchu.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outside of Cusco</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the outskirts of Cusco, many archaeological sites can be found, such as Sacsayhuaman. This imposing edifice is a wonderful example of late Incan architecture but was left unfinished after the arrival of the Conquistadors. In June, the festival of Inti Raymi, pays homage to the sun and attracts large crowds. Another important site in Incan culture is Quenko, this complex was primarily used for funerary rituals and is another one of the 300 different sites connected to the Temple of the Sun. The temple of Tambomachay is about 35 minutes by car outside of Cusco and is a site which the Incas used as a dedication to the life giving properties of water. The visitor can experience the tranquility of the water falling over the rocks and the quiet trickle of the nearby river. Another interesting archaeological town that is next to these baths is Ollantaytambo where ancient traditions are still practiced by its inhabitants. For an abundance of flora and fauna in the middle of the Eastern Andean mountains, you will find the Lower Huatanay Valley, this seemingly untouched paradise is also surrounded by lakes. To see these valleys from above, travel to the hills of Tipon and Pucará Pucutupampa, where the ruins upon these hills provide excellent views of Cusco and its environs. Finally, a visit to the Cusco area is incomplete without seeing Phuyupatamarca. This archaeological complex is a stunning outcropping on the side of a cliff which houses a labyrinthine set of buildings, channels, bridges and walkways. A definite stop on any visitors itinerary.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Among the many cultural offerings, the Heidelberg University, Germany\''s oldest university, is home to several unique venues like the Antikenmuseum, the University-Museum, the Studentenkarzer (a historic prison especially for students), and the Universitätsbibliothek (university library).  Heidelberg\''s iconic castle is also home to the one-of-a-kind Deutsches Apotheker Museum which showcases the history of pharmacy, while the castle itself has historic rooms and exhibitions complete with period furniture. Further on the Schlossberg you will find the Carl-Bosch-Museum, located in the former house of the eponymous Nobel Prize winner. For those who are interested in art, the Heidelberger Kunstverein and the Museum Haus Cajeth offer contemporary art, whereas the Museum der sakralen specializes in religious art. A wide thematic range from archaeology to the history of the town, paintings and sculptures to arts and crafts is presented in the Kurpfälzische Museum. Heidelberg also boasts an ethnological museum, the Völkerkundemuseum.   Specialty museums abound in the city. These include the Deutsches Verpackungsmuseum, where you can see classical German packing. The University\''s Botanischen Garten (botanical garden) in the Neuenheimer Feld and a little outside the town, the Bonsai-Museum and Textilmuseum Max Berk. The HeidelbergCard offers you free entry in a bulk of the museums and free use of Public transport within Heidelberg.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A cultural powerhouse, Heidelberg has a number of theaters for every taste, largely attributed to the university and its students. The Theater der Stadt Heidelberg, the municipal theater, offers a standard program of dramas, operas, and dance performances. In addition, it hosts the <em>Heidelberger Stückemarkt</em> and in summer the theater festival in the Castle, the <em>Schlossfestspiele</em>. The theater has a section for children and young adults, the Zwinger 3, that offers a special program for this age group.  Beside the municipal theater, Heidelberg has several private venues including a dance theater, a theater in the university and a variety of cultural theaters. The annual <em>Dance international </em>- an international dance festival - is hosted by the Unterwegs-Theater, a dance company. The Zimmertheater, the second oldest private theater in Germany, has an excellent lineup of performances. They play modern dramas; largely European or German plays. For more than 10 years, an amateur theater in an old factory, the Taeter Theater has produced modern and unconventional dramas. In the Old Town, the Volksbühne hosts community productions and an orchestra. The faculty for languages at the University has its own \"basement\" theater, the Romanischer Keller, that performs for an audience of students and other patrons. For an alternative theater experience, the Tikk-Theater in the Karlstorbahnhof is an unconventional pick.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Besides theater, art and museums, Heidelberg also has a variety of nightlife options on offer. Like everything else in Heidelberg, bars are largely concentrated in the Old Town, on the Untere Straße (Lower Street) to be precise, below the Holy Ghost Church. Bars cater to the student population, as well as an eclectic clientele of businessmen, tourists, and other patrons. Bars like Sonder Bar are among the popular options. If you prefer gigs of the independent variety, Karlstorbahnhof hosts a series of monthly disco events like the alternative Chop Suey Club and Brit-pop oriented Rollercoaster. Halle 02, which is located on the other side of the rail tracks at Heidelberg Hauptbahnhof, is most popular for student parties, art exhibitions and concerts. If jazz is your thing, then Cave 54 is definitely the place to be, also known as the oldest student bar in Heidelberg. If you feel your left-of-center spirit emerging, check out Villa Nachttanz, which is conveniently located near the tracks of the S-Bahn in Pfaffengrund/Wieblingen; punk parties, goth gigs in an abandoned house, a garden with regular bonfires and the cheapest beer around — what more do you need?</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cinemas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most of the cinemas are located in Heidelberg\''s city center or nearby. Those who are interested in the latest movies and the standard program can opt for one of the big multiplexes while in smaller theaters like the Gloria & Gloriette; they screen independent and alternative films. The award-winning cinema, especially noted for its children\''s program, lays its emphasis on European cinema. In October and November the International Movie Festival Mannheim-Heidelberg is organized each year, drawing cinephiles to the city, while in summer (June-August) the Gloria cinema organizes the popular Open-Air-Cinema event in the Neuenheimer Feld. The Karlstorbahnhof offers cultural movies from all over the world—mostly in their original language with subtitles.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Heidelberg has an eclectic array of festivals through the year, starting with the Heidelberg Spring, a lively music festival and the Heidelberger Stückemarkt, a drama festival in the start of the year. Later on, the Heidelberg Castle Festival takes place in summer, followed by the Heidelberg Fall Festival, and the Heidelberg Christmas Market. These festivals represent the city\''s vibrant character and invite visitors to experience firsthand the city\''s multifaceted and lively nature.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (2428,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Altstadt (Old Town)</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With its magnificent backdrop and narrow, picturesque roads, the Old Town is perhaps the most frequented destination in Heidelberg. This area extends to about two kilometers (one and a quarter miles) on both sides of the lively Hauptstraße from Bismarckplatz in the west along the south bank of the river Neckar and to the foot of the famous Schloss (Castle). The castle sits majestically enthroned on a small plateau above the river and town. Other important locations include the Universitätsplatz (University place), the Marktplatz (Market place) and the Alte Brücke (Old bridge). Most of Heidelberg\''s museums are to be found in the Old Town, along with theaters, cinemas, and countless restaurants and pubs. Heidelberg University, the oldest in Germany and one of the oldest in the world, offers various short-term and long-term courses in different fields.  The whole of Old Town can be discovered easily and pleasantly on foot. However, if you are driving down, the city center offers ample parking space. Walking is particularly recommended during the months of November and December when the famous Heidelberg Christmas Market or when the Heidelberg Castle Festival takes place to avoid traffic jams.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Schlierbach, Ziegelhausen & Bergheim</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Neckar valley leads upstream to the east. Schlierbach lies here on the southern side. It was first documented in 1245 as having hardly more than 3,000 inhabitants and even today, it is arguably the smallest district in Heidelberg. Located in northern Heidelberg, Ziegelhausen was founded in 850 CE. It is beautifully situated between the Neckar meadows and the Odenwald Forest, and is a fantastic starting point for hiking-tours. The Textile Museum Max Berk and the Benedictine cloister Stift Neuburg are both popular visitors\'' choices.  West of the Old town and castle, between the Kurfürsten-Anlage and the Neckar, the district Bergheim reaches from the Bismarckplatz in the center to the motorway. In 769, Bergheim had already been mentioned as an independent settlement, but in 1392, the inhabitants were resettled within Heidelberg\''s town walls. The area was only built up again in the 19th Century, characterized by institutes and the university hospital, small businesses, and residential premises.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Weststadt, Rohrbach, Boxberg & Emmertsgrund</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">South of Bergheim lies the Weststadt, with its beautiful old facades. It is a district much in demand amongst potential house buyers today. To the west of it, you will find the main railway station. It is only recently, since 1935, that the Südstadt has developed and expanded. It now joins the Weststadt to the Mark-Twain-Village and the NATO Headquarters, with the former village Rohrbach to its south. Rohrbach had already been documented as early as 766 CE. and, like Heidelberg itself, suffered damage in the Thirty Years War and the French-Palatinate War of Succession. The districts of Boxberg and Emmertsgrund are situated on a rise above Rohrbach, and have only really grown in the last 50 years.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kirchheim</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The western Kirchheim is also an old settlement. Tombs of Merowinger from the early Stone Age (3500-1800 BCE) were found here. Kirchheim itself was first mentioned in 767 CE. It, too, suffered from the wars in the 17th Century and afterwards seemed to develop at breakneck speed. From a population of just 350 inhabitants in 1766, it had expanded to 2,000 by 1861. In 1920, it was incorporated into Heidelberg and is now home to some 15,000 inhabitants. Like Rohrbach, Kirchheim\''s new infrastructure presents a wide range of gastronomic and shopping possibilities.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pfaffengrund & Wieblingen</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pfaffengrund lies in northwestern Heidelberg and was part of the \"The Garden City Movement\" at the beginning of the 20th Century. This group\''s objective was to bring about low-priced housing options for working-class families and other socially disadvantaged citizens. With this background, the Pfaffengrund developed slowly but steadily in phases: 1920, 1934, and 1948 to 1953. The district now has a population of about 8,000.  Wieblingen lies between the highway and a bend of the Neckar River. Not only was a mammoth tooth found here, but also traces of human settlements dating back to the Stone Age. Wieblingen itself was first mentioned in a deed of donation in 767 CE. In the following centuries, the Wieblinger inhabitants made their living from agriculture and fishing, but this hamlet was plundered on several occasions and burnt down in the wars of the 17th Century. In the 19th Century, crafts workshops and industrial companies flourished in this area. The residential character changed from village-like structures to working-class dwellings, and like Pfaffengrund, a garden city with small houses was set up. Nowadays Wieblingen even has a specialty museum, the Bonsai-Museum, which is certainly worth a visit.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Neuenheim & Handschuhsheim</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Neuenheim is situated just north of Heidelberg\''s city center. Its origins date back to a Roman Castellum. Neuenheim was first mentioned in 765 CE and developed, like the hamlets around, into a settlement for peasants and fishermen. In the Thirty Years War and again in the French-Palatinate War of Succession, this region was completely destroyed. Later, in the 19th Century it became the favorite residential area of university professors and today one can still admire the beautiful art nouveau villas. With the beginning of the 20th Century, the university institutes for natural sciences were relocated from the town center to the close-by Neuenheimer Feld. Apart from two Max-Planck-Institutes, the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), the country\''s largest biomedical research institute is also based here. Furthermore, you will find a cluster of sports grounds, public swimming-pools, the Youth Hostel and last but not least, the Heidelberg Zoo and the Botanical Garden in this district.  Heidelberg\''s northernmost district is Handschuhsheim, first documented in 765 CE. Over many centuries, until 1600, it belonged to the aristocratic dynasty of Handschuhsheim, whose last heir lost his life in a tragic duel. The impressive Tiefburg, surrounded by a deep moat, once belonged to this dynasty. In the St. Vitus Church, the oldest church on Heidelberg grounds, several members of the family are buried in old and fascinating sepulchers. The Handschuhsheimer Schlößchen, and the many restaurants and pubs are definitely worth a visit. Heidelberg maintains a fair balance between cultural charm and industrial adaptation, and cherishes its well-deserved dynamic flair. As the popular local phrase goes, \"<em>Ich hab\'' mein Herz in Heidelberg verloren</em>\" (I lost my heart in Heidelberg) - visit this enchanting city of unlimited grace and fall in love with its enviable charisma.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The city is known for its soul-stirring music festivals, whether it is the unique International Choral Festival or the River City Roots Festival. Bibliophiles flock to the city during the city\''s biggest literary fiesta, the Montana Book Festival. The city is also famous for the Celtic Festival held at Caras Park, which celebrates the Celtic way of life and all its splendors, from music and food, to dance. Summers also herald market season in the city, with hordes of vendors taking their local bounty and wares to city streets.

Its location in the Northern Rockies means that winters are not too harsh, opening up possibilities for outdoor recreation round the year. First off, warm up with a lesson in stand-up paddle boarding on Clark Fork River, or try surfing at the artificial Brennan\''s Wave in Downtown Missoula. Then, huff and puff your way up any of the mountain trails that lead to the summits of Mount Sentinel and Blue Mountain. These trails also offer opportunities for bike-riding. The Pattee Canyon Recreation area is great for horseback riding, while disc golf courses like the Linda Vista Golf Course are a short drive away.

The river forms a fitting backdrop to the slew of shops, restaurants, museums and galleries that dot Pine, Spruce and Alder streets. Downtown Missoula is bounded by railroad tracks to the north, May Street to the east, and extends all the way along the river to the end of Easy Street to its west. Some of the landmarks that you will see as you enter downtown include the Missoula Art Museum, the Wilma Building, the Millennium Building and the Florence Hotel.

Greenough Park\''s dense coniferous trees make perfect homes for more than 100 bird species, while the Rattlesnake Creek is surrounded by an aura of serenity. But the real attraction here is the gigantic Mount Jumbo, replete with its elk-filled expanses and unending trails that snake their way to the top.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Northside / Westside</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Both of these communities are well-known for their easy descent into Downtown Missoula rather than any distinct cultural flavor of their own.

While St Thomas is not largely known for its museums, there are a handful spread across the island that appeal to curious visitors. The Virgin Islands Children\''s Museum in Charlotte Amalie\''s historic heart is a good place to take family, and is full of interactive exhibits and scientific displays. <font color=\"#0000ff\">T</font><font color=\"#0000ff\">h</font>e St Thomas Historical Trust Museum waxes eloquent about the island\''s rich heritage and culture, and the Pirates Treasure Museum in Havensight is a priceless repository consisting of shipwrecked treasures and artifacts that were once lost to the sea. Other small museums include the Weibel Museum and the Haagensen House in Charlotte Amalie, a restored historic house that once belonged to a Danish banker.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A duty-free shopping haven that has held its status since 1724, the island is teeming with a multitude of shops that cater to avid shoppers and cruise passengers who scour the port for relatively less expensive jewelry and other luxury items. Downtown Charlotte Amalie and the Main Street near Fort Christian is where the most dazzling shopping boutiques lie. Peppered with a mix of jewelry shops, perfume stores, branded luxury accessories and specialty stores, this area is a shoppers\'' paradise. Not far away is Havensight Mall, another retail landmark near the cruise ship port that is brimming with duty-free stores. Yacht Haven Grande, a stunning avenue for luxury shops sits amid Charlotte Amalie and Havensight, and is home to more than 40 designer stores and boutiques.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sports</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Horse racing at Clinton Phipps Racetrack provides gathers a crowd every other Sunday. While the crowd is mostly local, a smattering of tourists also place bets.  School fields and Emile Griffith Park, located along Route 30 in Charlotte Amalie, often see local teams play baseball. Avid fans are always welcome to sit in the stands.  The St Thomas International Regatta is the island\''s premier sailboat race event with competitors coming in from all over the Caribbean. All are welcome to view the festivities that ensue at the St. Thomas Yacht Club.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (2615,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Charlotte Amalie</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The island\''s main town, Charlotte Amalie, bustles like any small city with vacationers shopping and residents heading off to work. Traffic can pile up along the waterfront Route 30, called Veterans Drive, and the city\''s main parking lot adjacent to Fort Christian is often filled. Despite the surface buzz, it is easy to find quiet pockets away from Charlotte Amalie and other busy areas. At the heart of Charlotte Amalie is Fort Christian, a settlement that is also home to the eponymous 17th-century red-brick fort built by Danish settlers. The oldest structure in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the fort is surrounded by a bevy of historical landmarks that bring alive the splendid past of the settlement. From the legendary 99 steps that lead to the top of Blackbeard\''s Castle, a watchtower from the same period, to the Government House and the Emancipation Gardens and memorial that stand as a symbolic testament to the abolition of slavery, Charlotte Amalie\''s Fort Christian area is a sightseeing complex in itself.  The Main Street, a vibrant thoroughfare stretching through Downtown Charlotte Amalie is a paradise for shopping, packed with a multitude of duty-free shops and specialty boutiques. The accommodations options nearby are many. Luxury hotels and condominium complexes line the beaches on the island\''s eastern end. Historic hotels and inns are tucked into Charlotte Amalie\''s back streets. Cozy guest houses dot the hills above Charlotte Amalie Harbor and vacation villas pepper many exclusive residential neighborhoods.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Frenchtown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This settlement, located to the west of the island\''s capital can be reached by driving via Veterans Drive, along the waterfront. Once here, don\''t be thrown by the colloquial Norman-French dialect that is still used here by locals. Relatively less safer than the island\''s capital, there isn\''t much to do here, other than visit the miscellany of unique bars and restaurants that line its waterfront streets. The Hassel Island Historic District, located in the Caribbean Sea, offers a handful of hiking and kayaking tours.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">West End</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hotel visitors and guests heading for a sailboat charter usually arrive at the modern Cyril E. King Airport, located at the western end of the island. Facing Lindbergh and Brewers Bay, the West End of St Thomas is lined with a dazzling array of villas, resorts and hotels. The Brewers Bay Beach is a favorite sand-lined attraction here, while the Reichhold Center for the Arts and the University of the Virgin Islands are located nearby.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Havensight</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Boasting one of the busiest cruise ship ports in the world, Havensight offers a wide range of water-sports in its sun-dappled location along Long Bay. A variety of marine excursions, scuba diving, snorkeling and jet-skiing adventures can be availed here.  While Charlotte Amalie is the main shopping area, several shopping areas with tourist-oriented shops are now spread out all across the island. Havensight Mall, the community\''s main retail landmark, is home to over 60 shops and boutiques. For more kicks, the SkyRide to Paradise Point offers spectacular gondola rides that soar 700 feet (213 meters) above ground to offer sweeping views of the entire island.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Water Island</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This island offers a vast variety of activities. Spend the day snorkeling, sunning or snoozing at a crystal clear cove ringed with a white sandy beach and palm trees, head down to the briny deep on a Scuba excursion, set sail to an offshore island, play a round at Mahogany Run Golf Course, or visit any of the historic sites in the main town of Charlotte Amalie and around the island. Numerous tour and water-oriented excursions are popular with hotel guests as well as cruise ship passengers.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Northside</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A trip around the island with a taxi driver or in your rental car should include stops at the palm-fringed Magens Bay Beach, the island\''s most popular. You will find changing rooms, water sports rentals, and restaurants in addition to clear blue water and lovely white sand. As you travel around the island, you will see gorgeous views at nearly every turn in the road. Drake\''s Seat, where Sir Francis Drake reportedly checked on his fleet, and the busy Mountain Top are especially popular viewpoints.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

From gems like the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum that enthralls visitors with a rich collection of American folk art, to the DeWitt Wallace Decorative Arts Museum that balances both British and American decorative artwork collections from the 17th through the 19th centuries, Williamsburg has much to offer. Modern art lovers will adore the exhibitions at the Muscarelle Museum of Art. On Richmond Road, the Virginia Musical Museum is a unique repository containing musical instruments and related objects from over 40 years ago. Williamsburg is also known for its historic mansions and erstwhile stately homes that now function as museums, including the famous Governor\''s Palace, Bassett Hall and the Peyton Randolph House. A number of galleries can also be found in Williamsburg. The award-winning Williamsburg Art Gallery, an award-winning institution is located in Colonial Williamsburg\''s Merchants Square. The Williamsburg Contemporary Art Center and the Linda Matney Fine Art Gallery are other important purveyors of art in the city.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Historical Attractions</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As you might suspect, the Williamsburg area is jam-packed with sites of historical interest. Both Williamsburg and Jamestown have built recreations of colonial settlements. Colonial Williamsburg offers several walking tours to get you acquainted with its stories, as well as period homes, artisans, and even a trial reenactment at the courthouse. Historic Jamestown is the actual archaeological dig of the original settlement, with the found artifacts on display. Park rangers are happy to explain the history of the site. Adjacent to the excavation is Jamestown Settlement, which is a recreation of the settlement that is being excavated. The settlement includes actors who show everyday life in Jamestown, a Powhatan village, and replicas of the ships used to sail from England.  The Yorktown Victory Center is another recreation of colonial times, this time focusing on the battle of Yorktown, which won the Revolutionary War. Actors here demonstration colonial wartime life, and in separate areas, children can make woodblock prints while parents learn to spin flax into thread. If the battle scenes at Yorktown Victory Center pique your interest, you might also want to visit the U.S. Army Transportation Museum in Fort Eustis. Admission is free, and the museum teaches the public about the evolution of Army vehicles from colonial times to the present.  Plantation life was a big part of Colonial America and this is reflected in the many restored plantations that are open to visitors. Two of these are the Sherwood Forest Plantation, which was home to former president John Tyler, and Shirley Plantation, which was built in 1613 and is the oldest plantation in Virginia.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bars & Pubs</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fun in Williamsburg doesn\''t end after dark. There are plenty of pubs that cater to students and music lovers, some of which are historically themed. Josiah Chowning\''s Tavern, for example, invites visitors to participate in its Gambols, games and songs that were typical of 18th century taverns. The Cogan\''s Deli & Sports Pub, another local gem, combines live music, cocktails, and an atmospheric ambiance that makes it one of the most popular pubs in the city. Corner Pocket is a bar, restaurant, and music venue and a great place to shoot pool. It\''s also a great way to end a day touring Colonial Williamsburg as it is nearby. Pitcher\''s Sports Bar is just what it sounds like and can be a very relaxing environment if you like sports and beer. Yorktown Pub in, you guessed it, Yorktown is popular with the locals and it has great food and a great location, overlooking the water.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts & Cinemas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Williamsburg offers both contemporary films and live theater. For new films, check out Regal New Town Cinemas 12, a large movie theater, considering the size of the town it\''s in. For more upscale charm, visit the Kimball Theater, a 1933 playhouse available for private parties and screenings. The Kimball Theater is also the proud home of the Williamsburg Youth Orchestra, the Williamsburg Symphony Orchestra, and the Williamsburg Classic Swing Orchestra. Kaplan Arena, an indoor arena at the William and Mary Hall is favored for both athletic events and large-scale concerts. In the past, it has seen performers like Nirvana, Kendrick Lamar, Bruce Springsteen and the Beach Boys perform on stage. Williamsburg\''s top-notch Comedy Club also presents a riveting line-up of seasoned comedians who perform at various venues across the city. The Williamsburg Dinner Theatre on Richmond Road also performs to a full crowd.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Seasonal festivals almost outnumber stationary places of business in the Williamsburg area. Again because of its historical significance, dates of historical import are celebrated here more than any other location. For example, Independence Day at Colonial Williamsburg is not like any other Independence Day celebration. The day includes a fife and drum march, a read of the Declaration of Independence, and at night, an extraordinary fireworks display. Jamestown Landing Day in the nearby settlement is similar in that it celebrates another day in history: May 13, 1607, when the first English settlers arrived at what they would call Jamestown. The day includes sailing demonstrations and historical re-enactments of contact between English and Native. Another re-enactment that will interest history lovers is Military Through the Ages, an event performed at the Jamestown Settlement in which actors wear period uniforms and re-enact battles from the Revolutionary War and more modern wars. Bacon\''s Rebellion Night Walking Tour may be the most exciting of the seasonal events as it includes a mock burning commemorating the 1676 burning of Jamestown Francis Bacon orchestrated to protest England\''s rule. Brothers in Arms, which includes a parade and various presentations, celebrates African American soldiers and their role in wars from the Revolutionary War to World War II.  Non military festivals include the Virginia Shakespeare Festival, a month-long festival that celebrates Shakespeare\''s work and takes place at the College of William and Mary. The West Point Crab Festival includes three separate parades, river cruises, music, and a fireworks show over the river after sunset.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (2645,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Colonial Williamsburg/Williamsburg Historic District</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Williamsburg is best known for its colonial charm. Colonial Williamsburg is one of the city\''s main points of interest and features an 18th-century town complete with actors to create one of the largest living history museums in the world. Visitors can interact with the townspeople to become a part of history. Numerous Colonial Revival mansions and structures that span the 17th and 19th centuries also dot its historic streets, while there are a few reconstructed buildings as well. Among the most notable buildings are landmarks like the the Capitol, the original building which housed the House of Burgesses of the Colony of Virginia, the stately Governor\''s Palace dating back to the 18th Century, and the Raleigh Tavern, a place of congregation that now functions as a museum. Other places of interest are the Randolph House, the Courthouse, and the Bruton Parish Church.  Besides the institutional Raleigh Tavern, Colonial Williamsburg also has several other restaurants and taverns serving up olden day fare, adding to the complete experience.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">New Town</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This charming New Town is less touristy than the rest of the city. Filled with conveniences, New Town is a great place for shopping, dining, or catching a movie. A slew of nearly 170 shops, plenty of restaurants and cafes line New Town Avenue and Courthouse Street. Some of the more refined dining options here include the Opus 9 Steakhouse and Bonefish Grill. Many services for residents, such as banks, fitness centers, and real estate agencies are also located in New Town.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">William & Mary</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A large part of Williamsburg belongs to the College of William and Mary located just south of New Town and to the west of downtown Williamsburg. This historic college which forms the centerpiece of this iconic district was founded in 1693, and is regarded the second-oldest university in the United States. Keeping the town young, the university is a first rate institute full of cultural offerings. The campus and surrounding areas that are spread out around the university are mostly teeming with institutional complexes, arenas, halls and college venues, intermittently speckled with dining and shopping options. The idyllic Crim Dell bridge, a wooden bridge laid out near the college campus, spans the eponymous pond, and is also surrounded by several myths and urban legends. Other prominent landmarks on and around the campus include the Muscarelle Museum of Art and the Williamsburg Library.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Surrounding Areas</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Beyond colonial happenings and suburban offerings, Williamsburg also has a plethora of unique attractions drawing both locals and tourists just outside the city center. Amusement park Busch Gardens and Water Country USA, a water park, are located in Williamsburg and are incredible attractions for wholesome family fun. To its north are also shopping outlet centers such as Williamsburg Prime Outlets, as well as Williamsburg Pottery which manufactures and sells handmade salt glaze pottery.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Jamestown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Site of the first permanent English settlement in North America, Jamestown today is a historical site that provides numerous ways to learn about the past. There are no permanent residents in Jamestown, although during the day it is bustling with colorful colonial characters and tourists from all over the world. The two main Jamestown attractions are both centered around the town\''s rich history. Jamestown Settlement is a recreation of an English fort, a Native American village, and the ships that used to sail to the New World. Also at Jamestown is Historic Jamestown, the actual site of the original colony featuring archaeological digs and glass blowing.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Yorktown</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A tiny town with less than 300 inhabitants, Yorktown is primarily known for the part it played in the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. Historic Yorktown contains buildings dating back to the colonial era, as well as quaint shops, cafes and restaurants. See Yorktown Battlefield where General Cornwallis surrendered to General Washington and the Yorktown National Cemetery where hundreds of Civil War soldiers are buried.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

There are three big ski areas nearby. Banff Mount Norquay, only a five-minute drive from Banff, is excellent for beginners. Sunshine Village is huge, encompassing five mountains with 12 lifts. The terrain ranges from bunny hills to more challenging trails, like Delirium Dive, a 50-degree slope infested with cliffs and so dangerous that it is open only a few days of the year. Lake Louise Ski Area has the best terrain of the three, and is host to the World Cup downhill races. Cross country ski trails can be found at Banff Mount Norquay, Lake Louise Ski Area and at the Canmore Nordic Centre.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Should you ever find yourself in desperate need of a plush stuffed moose, carved buffalo horn, or expedition-grade ski gear, chances are you will find it somewhere along Banff Avenue. From the Bow River Bridge to the Cascade Shops, both sides of the Avenue are lined with specialty stores, restaurants, and nightclubs. The shopping in Banff is unparalleled in this part of Canada, and many people come for no reason other than to shop. Where else can you find a complete Christmas boutique squeezed between a high-end furrier and an Inuit art dealer? Souvenir junkies can decide between hundreds of items as diverse as diamond \"Banff\" brooches and 50-cent novelty pens. Many major fashion designers have factory-direct retail outlets in Banff, which is considered a testing ground for the latest in high fashion. Gap and the popular Canadian designer Roots both have outlets along Banff Avenue. High-end outdoor gear can be found in any one of a dozen shops. From skin-tight cross-country gear to the monstrously baggy snowboard pants of Rude Boyz, everything you need to hit the hills is here. Patrons of the arts will love the town\''s many art galleries, which specialize in Native American and Rocky Mountain-inspired works. Photos of 19th-century mountaineering expeditions and mountain wildlife are standard fare, along with arrangements of rare dried and pressed Alpine flowers. Anyone with a sweet tooth will love Banff. Led by the notoriously delicious Fudgery, a cadre of candy stores are spaced evenly along Banff Avenue to renew the dwindling energy reserves of jaded shoppers.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Banff hosts dozens of festivals every year. The world-famous Banff Mountain Film Festival is one of the biggest and best, attracting films from all over the world, and is renowned for the release of new National Geographic movies.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Stage and Screen</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For those with an urge to revel in Hollywood\''s latest offerings, the Lux Cinema Centre is the only movie house in town. If you prefer the old-fashioned version, you can enjoy the live plays presented at the Banff Center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Banff nightlife is fast, unpredictable and a dominant part of the local culture. With one of the highest bar to people ratios in Canada, it is easy to find a place that suits your personal style. From the boisterous atmosphere of Wild Bill\''s Saloon to the quieter atmosphere of many of the hotel lounges, you can be sure to have just as good a time at night as you did during the day in Banff.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Adventures</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Banff is a mecca for adventure seekers, and there are literally hundreds of ways to satisfy your adrenaline cravings. Take a helicopter ride, race a snowmobile across a frozen lake, ride a gondola to the top of a mountain, or fly down a snowy slope on a pair of skies - the opportunities for thrill-seekers are endless.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">History and Culture</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As Banff National Park is a World Heritage Site, there are plenty of ways to discover the past. The Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies, the Banff Center, and the Banff Museum of Natural History are open year round. For information on the dozens of historical sites scattered throughout the park, the Banff Information Center can point you in the right direction.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (2958,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">City</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city of Banff is relatively tiny, squeezed into a narrow mountain valley and bisected by the Bow River. Nearly all the restaurants and businesses in town are crammed onto three blocks of Banff Avenue, which makes for a densely packed market atmosphere. The legendary Fairmont Banff Springs and the Upper Hot Springs lie south of the Bow River, while several kilometers to the west is the Cave and Basin National Historic Site. Also to the west lies the Banff Springs Golf Course, flanked by verdant fairways and sprawling greens on the banks of Bow River.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Banff National Park and Surroundings</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A kilometer or so northwest of town are the Vermilion Lakes, a small chain of marshy ponds with walking trails that allow for picturesque strolls in summer and winter. The deserted airstrip lies across the Trans-Canada Highway, along with the Cascade Ponds and Lake Minnewanka. This area is popular with hikers in the summer, but should be avoided in the winter, as there may be icefalls from the steep slopes above. To the north is Mount Norquay Ski Area, which is only a 10-minute drive from town up a spectacular mountain road. Sunshine Village Ski Resort is a 20-minute drive to the west, and Lake Louise Ski Area is another half hour north. Along the Icefields Parkway towards the north end of the park is the Columbia Icefield Discovery Center and Athabasca Glacier—both are worth a visit. If you are driving to Banff, you might want to take a day or two and visit the Radium Hot Springs, which lie a two-hour drive west of Banff along one of the most spectacular stretches of highway in the world. Camping areas are scattered throughout the park, from commercial campgrounds with showers and cooking areas to wilderness campsites that are little more than a clearing in the trees. If you intend to camp, be sure to check with Parks Canada to ensure that the area you are heading into is safe and that there are vacant sites available.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Canmore</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The town of Canmore is a 15-minute drive to the east of Banff, just outside the park boundaries. This small mountain community received international attention in 1988 when it hosted the Winter Olympics Nordic skiing events at the Canmore Nordic Centre. Since then, it has become a popular spot for athletes to train, because of both the high altitude and excellent facilities. There are many hotels and shops in Canmore that rival those in Banff, and a great many tour companies that operate in the park are based here. Canmore is a great place to find the down-home local culture that is sometimes lacking in Banff. With lower food and housing prices, Canmore is home for many Banff business owners, as well as a center of late-night activity during the summer. Canmore\''s dramatic mountain backdrop and easy access to the back-country has made it an ideal location for shooting Hollywood movies. The actors can often be seen wandering around the downtown area and hanging out with the locals.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The Vineyard is blessed with beaches of every variety. Those suited for families with small children tend to lie on the Nantucket Sound where the waves are minimal and the water is warm. More adventurous swimmers should make their way to the ocean beaches on the south side of the island. Hikers, on the other hand, will find that some of the most magnificent views of the Island can be had from Gay Head, now officially referred to as Aquinnah.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Outdoors</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After a few days of relaxing on the beach, once you\''re refreshed and recharged, don\''t be surprised if you\''re taken over by an unspoken desire to hike, watch birds, perhaps even canoe or ride out into the sunset, inspired by the spectacular scenery of this quaint, colonial isle. The good folks at the Trustees of the Reservation understand this urge and arrange tame yet beautiful excursions into the rough country of the Vineyard. Cape Poge Wildlife Refuge and Wasque Reservation (East Shore), which is run by the Trustees, is one such piece of wilderness to explore. Think pristine barrier beaches, salt marshes and more. Embark on one of the daily, guided 3-hour \"safaris,\" venture out on foot, set out on a guided canoe trip. The Trustees also arrange twice daily fishing trips that are quite popular. If bird watching is more to your liking, head to Felix Neck Wildlife Sanctuary, which is operated by the Mass Audobon Society. For a destination point that is more beach-centric head to Long Point Wildlife Refuge Beach on the island\''s south shore. Pristine beaches that go on for miles in either direction make for a rewarding hike and close encounters with native wildlife. Once the Vineyard\''s land-based wilderness areas have been sufficiently explored, head to the ocean for water sports of every stripe. One of the most popular pursuits on the Vineyard for visitors and residents alike is sailing.  Edgartown is home to the Edgartown Yacht Club, which each year hosts the Edgartown Regatta. Those who thrill at the high drama of a race on the seas should be sure to be on Island for this annual event. Other smaller races are held here throughout the season. For sailing lessons, call or visit the Island Sailing Schools of Martha\''s Vineyard, Inc. to schedule a class or to sign up to participate in sailing activities. The school offers instruction for all levels and age groups. For those who\''d rather take to the seas than watch the action from the shore, but do not wish to commandeer their own sailboat, sailing and yacht charters are the best alternative. Catamaran Arabella is one such charter known to provide romantic sailing experiences around the Vineyard.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nightlife</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">During the height of the summer season, a lively vibe prevails over certain sectors of the Island, most notably in and around Oak Bluffs and Edgartown. After all, even the most devoted beachcomber or sailor likes to top off their day of outdoorsy pursuits with a lovely nightcap overlooking the harbor. At the end of the day, the Martha\''s Vineyard restaurant and bar scene is often what passes for nightlife. Head to the harbor and grab a seat outside with friends at watering holes such as the Newes from America Pub in Edgartown. Or, if you\''re yearning for a bit of culture, check out the offerings at the Vineyard Playhouse. Oak Bluffs is one of the only two towns on the Island that has a significant after-dark scene. Although you can\''t go as far as to call it a \"club scene,\" there are a few places where singles can mix it up on the dance floor or at the bar. Lola\''s is a favorite among locals and visitors alike for live music and dancing. Offshore Ale Co is another hotspot, serving delicious microbrews, while the Loft is a great place to hang out with friends and battle it out over shuffleboard, pool and darts or dance the night away to DJs spinning the latest tunes.Edgartown boasts a fairly diverse nightlife as well that\''s centered mainly around the city\''s bars. Drop by Alchemy for some of the best cocktails to be had on the island, or head to the Port Hunter for live music. Other popular nighttime hangouts include the Newes From America Pub, Seafood Shanty and The Wharf.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museums & Art Galleries</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Martha\''s Vineyard may not have a particularly large cache of museums to explore, but those that do call this island home offer a mesmerizing glimpse into the depths of its history, art and culture, At the top of the list is the Martha\''s Vineyard Museum in Edgartown, a haven for history buffs looking to get to know the island better. Built in 1672, the Vincent House Museum, also in Edgartown, is the island\''s oldest residence and is now open to visitors for a glimpse into life on the island over four centuries. The Cottage Museum in Oak Bluffs is another historic home that now serves as a museum, complete with period furniture and antiques.Those who enjoy the fine arts will find plenty to keep them busy.

Other fine choices include the North Water Street Gallery, the Granary and the Gallery Josephine.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Performing Arts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Martha\''s Vineyard Performing Arts Center, in Vineyard Haven, is the island\''s premier venue for the performing arts.

Also in Vineyard Haven, the Vineyard Playhouse is a historic, 19th Century black box theater that hosts professional theatrical productions.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although devoid of shopping malls and plazas, Martha\''s Vineyard is replete with antique stores specializing in maritime treasures, galleries stocked with artwork by regional and nationally recognized artists, boutiques selling one-of-a-kind wares, and shops brimming with island-made goodies. At Aquinnah Cliffs, shops owned by the Wampanoag Tribe offer authentic Native American crafts.</div><br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The most famed of these are Alley\''s General Store, the Field Gallery and Sculpture Garden, and the Grange Hall. The town also hosts the annual fair of the Martha\''s Vineyard Agricultural Society.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chilmark and Menemsha</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chilmark and Menemsha are located at the southern tip of Martha\''s Vineyard, along the coast. Like many towns on the island, Chilmark was once a fishing village. Visitors come here to enjoy the quiet countryside and rough beaches. Menemsha remains a fishing community today.

Anchored by Pearl Street, a vibrant thoroughfare boasting a magnificent four-block pedestrian mall, the Pearl Street Mall, the downtown area brims with tourists, but is also a lively haven for the eclectic locals. The tree-lined promenade, long ago a refuge for the wildest of the wild westerners, is alive with cafes, galleries, brewpubs, restaurants and every type of shopping imaginable. <br><br>If high culture is on the agenda, then browse around at one of the galleries brightening downtown, including the popular Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art. You can also check out the Dairy Centre for the Arts for productions by local theater and dance troupes, or a graceful performance from the Boulder Ballet. <br><br>The Boulder County Farmers Market adds a bit of flavor from April to October and offers everything from organic veggies and local wines to famous homegrown cantaloupe. Boulder Creek Path, crowded with bikers, in-line enthusiasts, walkers and wanderers, also meanders through downtown. Along the way, the trail passes the Underwater Fish Observatory, Central Park, and the Heartling Sculpture Park before winding into Boulder Canyon towards the mountain town of Nederland.  <br><br>The big box retail chains, strip malls, fast food fry pits (even Boulder has them), occupy a long stretch of 28th Street, just a bit south of the city center. The area is great for last minute stops before heading to the mountains. This strip is also the place in town to find a movie theater. <br><br>Old North Boulder is where you\''ll find mid-century modern architecture alongside shopping plazas and urban farms. The Mountain Flower Goat Dairy offers tours and is a great way to experience the city\''s love for sustainable living first hand!</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">University Hill</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Known as \"The Hill\" by locals, the neighborhood is the home of the University of Colorado. Literally parked on a hilltop above downtown, the district provides the typical college town quirkiness and a host of popular attractions including the Heritage Center and the Sommers Bausch Observatory. <br><br>Spread across more than 600 acres of rolling landscape, University of Colorado is a feat of architectural beauty with old stone buildings topped with red Spanish tiled rooftops. Just moseying about the campus creates a sense of wonder, especially while moving through tree-lined passageways, or gazing into the serene depths of Varsity Pond. Catch a CU football game at Folsom Field. For an abstract pulse of the student body visit the CU Art Museum which displays contemporary work by revered artists as well as students. Try to see Foucault\''s Pendulum make a move or stargaze at the Fiske Planetarium. <br><br>After checking out the University of Colorado, head over to The Hill\''s entertainment district. The area\''s bars and restaurants fill with students searching for pizza and cold beer. Neo-hippies wander the streets and the coffee shop crowd finds hot beverage solace in one of the many quaint cafes. The area can get a little rowdy, especially after Buff games and long nights of drinking. <br><br>The residential neighborhood bordering The Hill is an odd mix of fraternity and sorority houses, apartment complexes, rental houses and attractive single-family homes. The streets are usually bustling with activity well into the night.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chautauqua</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">A historic neighborhood nestled beneath the Flatirons, Chautauqua is known for its scenic beauty as well as its cultural legacy. Chautauqua Park rests at the base of Flagstaff Mountain on the southwest side of University Hill. The park, one of three remaining from the early 1900s cultural movement, features a dining hall and an outdoor auditorium that hosts an excellent summer concert series.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Boulder</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">North Boulder, or NoBo to locals, is a neighborhood on the rise. Once an industrial hub, the area today features a great selection of bars, pubs and restaurants alongside contemporary galleries featuring up-and-coming artists who flock here thanks to the relatively affordable rates. Immerse yourself in the art scene at the Friday Art Walk or sip a glass at the Decadent Saint. Outdoor enthusiasts will enjoy hiking the Wonderland Lake Trailhead that affords spectacular views of the foothills.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South Boulder and Table Mesa</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Boulder contains a wealth of residential communities peppered with parks and open space. Martin Park, on the south side of town, is a step into 1950s tract housing. Table Mesa, nestled in the western foothills, is home to the National Center for Atmospheric Research and miles of easy nature trails.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">East Boulder</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Known for its youthful vibe and tech-driven economy, East Boulder is a neighborhood that\''s pushing the envelope. It\''s here that you\''ll find great restaurants run by upcoming chefs, coffee shops and craft breweries like BRU Handbuilt Ales as well as miles of trails for those who enjoy an outdoor lifestyle.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Gunbarrel</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most of Boulder\''s big business sectors reside on the fringes of the city. Gunbarrel, on the eastern edge of town, is home to IBM and Celestial Seasonings. Boulder\''s small southern neighbor, Louisville, is home to Storage Tek. Broomfield, nine miles (15 kilometers) south of Boulder, recently opened the posh Interlocken Business Park and Resort and is attracting national attention as a hot relocation spot.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Eldorado Springs</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you are searching for an otherworldly experience altogether, take a day and visit one of the area\''s mountain towns. Eldorado Springs, where the world comes to rock climb, was once a hangout for the well-to-do including Damon Runyon and President Eisenhower. Now, it is a quaint commuter community of about 900 residents. Nederland, home to Eldora Mountain Resort, is a tourist-oriented former gold claim that still possesses a bit of the anti-establishment mountain attitude.</div>\r\n\r\n<br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Its heart and soul is the center plaza, known officially as Parque Benito Juarez, but often referred to as the <em>zocalo</em>, or simply as Plaza Central. Shops, restaurants and hotels surround the plaza, and since the whole area is blocked off to traffic, it can become quite crowded. Still, the area is a pleasant place for a <em>paseo</em> (walk), particularly on Sunday evenings when the locals gather to enjoy the free open-air concerts and dances. The main stretch, Avenida Rafael Melgar, is lined with high-end jewelry boutiques, souvenir shops, department stores and restaurants.  <br><br> Running parallel to Avenida Melgar is the malecón, an ocean-side boardwalk decorated with sculptures commemorating events in Cozumel\''s history. Follow it north to the tidy Museo de la Isla de Cozumel to learn more about the Maya. Downtown San Miguel is also the place to find family-owned hotels with lower prices and a more Mexican atmosphere. When the plaza or main streets get congested from cruise ship traffic, walk east from 25 Avenida A onwards into the more residential neighborhoods, where the small <em>tiendas</em> (stores) and markets charge local prices.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Costera Norte</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">North and south of San Miguel are where the luxurious hotels and beaches start. The <em>Costera Norte</em> (North Coast), informally called <em>Zona Hotelera Norte</em>, begins just past the airport road. Much of its beachfront has been taken over by posh resorts with their grand lobbies and pools. The longest beach is Santa Pilar Beach, followed by San Juan Beach. Here the north road ends and you must take a boat to reach the pristine north coast lagoons, such as <em>Laguna Ceiga</em> or the private paradise island, Passion Island.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Costera Sur</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Southern Hotel Zone, located along <em>Carretera Chankanaab</em>, and also known as the <em>Costera Sur</em>, offers the best beaches beginning at Corona Beach and ending at Palancar Beach. The famous coral reef running parallel to this part of the coast is a protected zone called Parque Marino de Cozumel.  <br><br> The first attraction along the way is the popular Chankanaab Park, a park with a landlocked lagoon connected to the sea. Just off the fine sandy beach is excellent snorkeling where you can spot tame fish, underwater statues, a sunken ship and a pirate cannon.  <br><br> The two largest beaches, San Francisco Beach and Mia Beach, are popular spots with the cruise ship crowd that swarms both beaches by early afternoon. On Sundays, San Francisco Beach is the gathering spot for Mexican families who come to enjoy the beach and bring along their music, games and family picnics. You may want to visit Mr. Sancho\''s for its free admission, laid-back beach atmosphere and good Mexican cuisine. Crowds and noise aside, both beaches offer excellent swimming and snorkeling. Those in search of more tranquility can follow the highway west to where Costera Sur takes a northern turn becoming the Costera Este (Eastern) Highway. Here the beaches are wild, wind-swept and, for the most part, deserted. Along the way is Cozumel\''s original settlement founded in 1847. El Cedral is now a charming farming community known for its country fairs. Beside its modern church are the remains of the oldest Mayan structure on the island. Signs along the highway will point you in the right direction.</div>\r\n \r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parque Punta Sur to Punta Molas</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just as the highway turns north you will find Punta Sur Park, a national wildlife refuge. Inside the park is the ancient Mayan lighthouse, El Caracol, which was built as an early hurricane warning system. At the southernmost tip is Celarain Point Lighthouse, a historic lighthouse that has been transformed into a navigational museum.  <br><br> Paradise Beach is the first beach just outside of the park\''s entrance. Close to Chen Rio Beach are two smaller Mayan ruins, El Mirador and El Trono. The best beaches for swimming are found at the crescent shaped Chiqueros Point cove and at San Martin Beach. If you are on this beach during the full moon in May or June, you may see giant sea turtles come ashore to lay their eggs. Further north is Morena Point, which is popular with surfers and boogie boarders because of its pounding surf.  <br><br> Punta Este has a blustery beach, perfect for beachcombing, and is the final stop before the paved highway turns west and becomes <em>Avenida Benito Juarez</em>, leading back into San Miguel. An unpaved road continues north, leading to some of the most unspoiled beaches: <em>Ixpal Barco, Los Cocos, Hanan Reef, Ixlapak</em> and <em>Playa Bonita</em> are all what you would expect from a Caribbean beach. Along the way is the Mayan ruin of Castillo Real. The roads end at Mola Point Lighthouse, the island\''s most northern point. A tour is recommended to explore this extremely rugged area.</div>\r\n \r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ixchel\''s Ceremonial Center</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Located in the lush sub-tropical forest, the serene San Gervasio ruins were once a ceremonial center where <em>Ixchel</em>, the Maya goddess of fertility and childbirth, was worshipped. Believed to have been occupied from 300 to 1500 CE, San Gervaiso has many excellent examples of Classic and Post-Classic Mayan architecture. Guides are available at the site, but you can also buy an excellent guidebook at the museum in town.</div>\r\n \r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mainland</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cozumel is 18 kilometers (11.5 miles) from the mainland and Carmen Beach, one of the largest cities along the Riviera Maya coastline, is a 45-minute ferry ride away. From there it\''s a one hour bus ride south to the Mayan ruins of Tulum, or north to the mega-resorts of Cancun. Other nearby attractions include underground caves, snorkeling at Xel-Ha, and the unashamedly commercial Mayan theme park, Xcaret.</div>\r\n\r\n<br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Yet there are still many sights to see—the Rathaus (City Hall) Römer, the Leinwandhaus, Paulskirche, Dom and Goethehaus are only a few yards apart from each other. For shopping adventures, visit the Schillerpassage, Goethestraße or the Fressgass Passage. Evening entertainment in the form of theater or other cultural pursuits can be found in places like Schmiere and the Tigerpalast Varieté Theater.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bahnhofsviertel</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the 1920s, more than 20,000 people lived in the ornate houses close to the main station, the Hauptbahnhof. Today the <em>Bahnhofsviertel</em> (station quarter) is home to just 4000 residents. There are many reasons people frequent this neighborhood, with the 1970s red light district being just one. The area is filled with entertainment venues like the English Theatre and numerous bars and restaurants. Locals flock here after a day at work in the nearby Banking Quarter.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bockenheim</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">The district of Bockenheim, home to Frankfurt\''s Johann Wolfgang Goethe University and some 40,000 students, is extremely lively. The cafés, bistros, pubs, and shops near the university campus have focused their attentions on the young clientele. A favorite is Cafe Crumble, serving delicious traditional breakfasts in a typical coffeehouse setting. The largest concentration can be found along multicultural Leipziger Strasse with its small boutiques and eateries nestled cheek by jowl. For a more upmarket vibe, head to Diplomatenviertel, with its international consulates and elegant villas.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bornheim</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">The \"merry village\" of Bornheim spans the divide between the traditional and the trendy. Old-world cider pubs, spanking-new bars, exclusive boutiques and simple corner shops attract a mixed clientele. At the heart of this residential area is Berger Straße; a great place for a bit of shopping. You\''ll find entertainment a plenty in the Mousonturm and in the Berger Cinema. If you are in need of relaxation, try the Chinese Garden. The Ice Rink is the perfect spot for energetic fun.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Höchst</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">The district of Höchst, which gave its name to the world-famous paint factory, was incorporated into Frankfurt in 1928. The old town\''s baroque beauty is showcased at the Bolongaro Palace on the Nidda estuary. The Neues Theater Höchst, is a cultural magnet featuring cabaret, comedy and children\''s theater. Popular concerts and artistic performances take place at the Jahrhunderthalle.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nordend</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nordend, the most densely populated and popular residential area of Frankfurt, boasts attractive streets and quaint 19th-century houses; once known for its bohemian vibe in the 1970s. It is today home to numerous pubs and small shops, and hosts a community of young professionals who live alongside the thriving student population. People meet up in one of the many Italian, Greek or Turkish restaurants in the area or in bars such as Harveys or Feinstaub.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ostend</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once a run-down working-class district, today Ostend is a much sought-after residential area. This neighborhood offers more than just industrial parks; it houses countless ornate villas and plenty of culture and entertainment possibilities. Literary enthusiasts meet in the Romanfabrik, while young party people head for Sandbar. In the old warehouses you\''ll find furniture design shops such as Kontrast, as well as dozens of advertising agencies and film production houses.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sachsenhausen</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">The district of Sachsenhausen on the opposite bank of the River Main is known for its cider and its old, half-timbered houses. Old Sachsenhausen has lost some of its charm over recent decades due to war and political strife, but it still has a lot to offer. For instance, there are elegant town houses on the river bank and fine boutiques on the elegant Schweizer Straße. Art and culture are alive at Museumsufer, where the National Film Museum, Museum of Ethnology and the Städel Museum are all located.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Westend</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Westend is situated in the shadows of the skyscrapers and high-rises that are home to the city\''s banks and financial companies. In the 1970s, the district was full of students and squatters demonstrating against the destruction of the area\''s old buildings. Today, offices and banks lend the area its character. Owners of the luxury flats and penthouse suites meet up to jog in Grüneburg park or relax in the Palm Garden. The recently restored Synagogue, the monumental IG-Farbenhaus and the Alte Oper are all well-worth a visit.</div>\r\n      \r\n<br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

Farther south than Montreal, it boasts a mild climate that sees little or no snow until after January. “The Peninsula\" refers to old Halifax, the area enclosed by the Bedford Basin on the east, the Atlantic Ocean on the south, and the Northwest Arm on the west.  <br><br>Downtown Halifax is where the action is. As an important shipping center, the commercial part of the harbor is busy year-round. Vessels from Russia, South America and Europe float next to stern, gray submarines. During the summer, huge luxury liners dock near the neck of the harbor and are a popular tourist destination. <br><br>Off the harbor, Downtown Halifax thrives as Atlantic Canada\''s prime financial hub, hosting major banking institutions, including the Bank of Canada, and a host of other major headquarters. While Halifax\''s harborside downtown, which has undergone quite a renaissance in the last few years, may not have an impressive tapestry of heritage-rich landmarks like its other provincial counterparts, it does house a smattering of historic buildings within its urbane sprawl. A monumental government landmark, the Province House, and the star-shaped Citadel Hill, a Victorian Era fortification that still graces the city, can be found in Downtown Halifax.  <br><br>Apart from operating as the city\''s economic epicenter, this neighborhood enjoys a dynamic nightlife and cultural scene, with an assemblage of entertainment venues, museums, shopping centers and restaurants built along its sparkling harbor. The Halifax Convention Centre, along with the historic Neptune Theatre and the Scotiabank Centre are some of the most prominent tenants of Downtown Halifax. <br><br>You\''re never lost in downtown Halifax. If you\''re going downhill, you\''ll end up at the waterfront. If you\''re walking uphill, you\''ll arrive at the city\''s largest and most famous landmark, the Halifax Citadel National Historic Site.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">South End</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">The South End is the ritzy part of the peninsula. Canopied by ancient trees, wide avenues give view to palatial homes constructed in various architectural styles, with grounds that are beautifully groomed and well planned. A drive through these leafy streets will take you to the southernmost part of the community, Point Pleasant Park. The park boasts one hundred and eighty-five acres (74 hectares) of old trees, quiet trails a large, grassy area on the ocean that\''s perfect for picnics, and an underground bunker. There, history buffs can envision hunkered-down soldiers from wars past, waiting for the approach of enemy ships. The park has a small shallow beach for family outings and its large parking lot allows easy access. <br><br>South End\''s leafy avenues are also home to an impressive array of universities and colleges, from the Dalhousie University and University of King\''s College, to Saint Mary\''s University.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">West End</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">The West End of Halifax is both a lovely residential area and a shopper\''s paradise. Originally occupied by farms and estates, the late 19th Century gave way to a residential boom, as several citizens settled into the tree-lined streets of this largely middle-class neighborhood. West End\''s retail scene draws bargain-hunters from both sides of the harbor. Most shopping is centered around the sprawling complex of the Halifax Shopping Centre, the province\''s biggest mall. The Village at Bayers Road is just north of this shopping behemoth, and is easily accessed from Bayers Road, a major artery leaving downtown Halifax. Further west is the Bayers Lake Industrial Park, whose name has become somewhat of a misnomer, as it has little industry and lots of shopping—you will find all of the major outlet stores here.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outlying Areas</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">The true East End of Halifax is in Dartmouth, in the Burnside Industrial Park, where the main industries are located along with the city\''s two newspaper plants. A sprawling complex of head offices and warehouses, Burnside will be a challenge for anyone without a map. <br><br>Nevertheless, visitors will still see street signs directing them to Dartmouth, Bedford and Halifax. Dartmouth is a quiet bedroom community across the harbor from Halifax, via the ferry or one of the city\''s two suspension bridges. But the 10-minute ferry ride from Halifax\''s waterfront across the picturesque harbor—home to luxury yachts, recreational boats and gigantic container ships heading for the open sea—is a must, just for the view.  <br><br>Bedford is north of Halifax\''s city centre on a long stretch of road called The Bedford Highway, a major route to the Halifax International Airport. Bedford is an old, treed, residential area extending west of the highway, but the highway, which follows the train tracks out of Halifax, is a busy commercial area with boutiques, specialty stores, garden nurseries, restaurants and large malls on both sides, all visible and easily accessible from the main road.</div>\r\n\r\n<br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (3129,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown Memphis grew from the warehouses that stored cotton and other goods shipped up and down the Mississippi River. For much of Memphis\'' history, this meant that the riverfront was solely a place for commerce. Today, however, some things have changed. Now, when you take a ride on the paddlewheel boats that run regular tours from the Memphis harbor, you\''re likely to spot joggers on the Riverfront Walk, visitors on Mud Island and elegant homes along the bluffs (including Cybill Shepard\''s—look for the round window). Visitors can take a beautifully restored trolley car up Main Street—parallel to the River—and grab a bite and a brew in one of the Pinch Historic District pubs, loop back to the south to see the Orpheum Theatre and continue on down to the Civil Rights Museum, located in the old <em>Lorraine Motel</em>, site of Martin Luther King Jr.\''s assassination. A ride up to Union Avenue and a walk two blocks East brings you to the Peabody Hotel, where the downtown comeback started. After a visit with the ducks in the lobby fountain, visit the Center for Southern Folklore and learn more about local culture and history. Cross Union for some popcorn and crackerjacks while the Memphis Redbirds play baseball in Autozone Park.  <br><br> Brought back from a downward spiral in the 1960s and 70s, Beale Street—\"Home of the Blues\"—now features lively bars, clubs, restaurants and souvenir shops. Closed to traffic on weekend evenings, the area teems with a mix of tourists, suburbanites, downtowners and kids turning flips for quarters. Here you can visit Alfred\''s Bar &amp; Grill restaurant, with its souvenirs and videos of Memphis\'' favorite son. Visit B.B. King\''s Blues Club and the Hard Rock Café for music, food and dancing. More of Memphis\'' fabulous musical heritage can be soaked up at the original Sun Studio, just a short distance from Beale Street. This studio, made famous by Elvis Presley and B.B. King, still records major musical acts.  <br><br>Downtown is also home to the South Main Arts District. Here you can stroll among the many galleries and independent boutiques peppered between the bars and cafes that line the streets.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Victorian Village</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Situated on the east side of downtown, Victorian Village features homes built at the turn of the century, still standing in their original, tree-lined setting. Some of these homes offer public tours.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Midtown/Central</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Midtown area stretches from I-240 on the West to the University of Memphis area on the East, and from Southern Avenue to Jackson Avenue. This lively neighborhood harbors beautifully restored residential areas, the city\''s highest concentration of ethnic restaurants, trendy clubs and live theater, along with some of the best places for antiques shopping.  <br><br> At the heart of Midtown lies the Overton Square Entertainment Complex, home of Playhouse on the Square, the Malco Studio on the Square movie house and wine bar, Loony bin Comedy Club, and a selection of restaurants and funky shops. To the north are the rolling lawns and shade trees of Overton Park, home of the Memphis Brooks Museum, and the Memphis Zoo.  <br><br> The Cooper-Young Historic District forms the south border of Midtown. There are annual tours of the neighborhood and its Cooper-Young Festival show off the turn-of-century homes, which have been lovingly restored. The area supports some first-rate restaurants, too. Farther East is Pink Palace, which houses exhibits on natural history, the Sharpe Planetarium and an IMAX Theater.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">University of Memphis Area</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">The University of Memphis is busy throughout the term. The stretches of Highland and Park along the borders of the campus have an eclectic collection of bars and restaurants that pull patrons beyond the usual student population. Pop into Newby\''s for a classic college bar experience complete with an outdoor patio, pool tables, and a relaxed atmosphere. Cure the hangover with a great brunch at Brother Juniper’s. For that perfect jolt of caffeine, Cafe Eclectic is your go-to while in the neighborhood.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">East</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">In an area ranging roughly from just East of the University of Memphis to just outside the I-240 perimeter, East Memphis encompasses the Laurelwood Shopping Center, Oak Court Mall, and the Poplar Plaza Shopping Center, the best locations in Memphis for designer boutique shopping. </p> <br><br>East Memphis, considered the city\''s garden district is home to a number of beautiful green spaces, elegant homes and tree-lined boulevards. East Memphians have the Dixon Gallery and Gardens, which features a collection of Impressionist paintings and first-rate traveling exhibits. The family-friendly Shelby Farms Park is located here. This urban park, one of the largest in the country is wonderful place to spend a day out in nature. <br><br>It\''s here that you\''ll find a number of culinary havens dabbling in contemporary cuisine with a soulful vision. Restaurants, such as Napa Cafe, can also be found to suit every price and palate.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">North</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">North Memphis is the kind of heterogeneous ethnic neighborhood common in cities such as Chicago and New York. With a recent influx of immigrants from Mexico, authentic taquerias and restaurants have sprung up near Jackson Avenue. Asian shops with exotic produce and merchandise are helping the area take on an appealing international flavor.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Graceland/Airport/South Memphis</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mention Memphis in Paris, Beijing, or Budapest, and who comes to mind? Well, Elvis Presley, of course. The King is more connected with his hometown than are most celebrities, and his home, Graceland, brings more visitors to Memphis from all over the world than any other single attraction in the area. While you\''re in the area don\''t forget to check out the C.H. Nash Chucalissa Archaeological Museum. The museum displays a fantastic re-creation of a Native American village, including offering visitors the chance to see an archaeological dig in progress.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Germantown, Bartlett and Cordova</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">While largely residential, Germantown brings in visitors for the international horse show. The area provides some excellent dining and shopping as well. For shopping, Germantowners and East Memphians flock to the Shops of Saddle Creek and the smaller Carrefour, located at Kirby Woods. Bartlett and Cordova have Cordova Cellars, where visitors can taste local wines and learn about wine-making, and the Davies Manor Plantation, a restored log home from the 19th Century. Many national chain restaurants and shops along with the Wolfchase Galleria shopping mall have made this area a major draw for out-of-towners.</div>\r\n\r\n<br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Also known as the Romantic Zone, Vallarta\''s quaint Old Town offers experiences that distinctly stand out from other touristy activities found in the rest of this bayside town. On the island, people can visit quaint outdoor shops, museums and an arboretum. A seaside walkway, El Malecón , is also in this part of town and is considered to be the heart of Puerto Vallarta. The Hotel Rosita, the first hotel built in this city, enjoys this central location and a spectacular beach view. A host of beachside restaurants, bars, local food stands and shops straddle the sides of Morelos, a thoroughfare that cuts through the heart of this neighborhood.   <br><br>Art lovers will find the works of internationally known Mexican artists featured at the Galeria Pacifico. This gallery is well worth your time to experience a taste of Mexico\''s cultural best.  <br><br>Visitors can also enjoy the architecture of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Guadalupe, one of the most recognized landmarks of the town. With the beautiful bay as a backdrop, visitors will also see noted statuary such as Los Arcos (the arches) while strolling along the Malecon. The famous Playa Los Muertos, or the Beach of the Dead, is one of the most beautiful places in town to enjoy glorious sunsets and sultry evenings.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">El Centro</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">The allure of Puerto Vallarta\''s azure waters and utterly romantic location was a huge draw for the swish expat set through better part of the 1960s and the 70s, when this fabulous town served as a rich, secluded vacation territory for most. Along with the droves of well-heeled international crowds that trickled in, also came in Hollywood\''s then-Golden couple - Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton - who, with their whirlwind romance immortalized this otherwise hidden Mexican gem as a coveted resort town. They chose Casa Kimberley, now converted into a dreamy hotel, as their love nest, which along with other landmarks, forms one of the main attractions in El Centro. </p> <br><br>Also known as \''gringo Gulch\'' for the jet setting crowd that continues to purchase seaside villas and vacation in the neighborhood\''s ritzy hotels, El Centro\''s proximity to the sea also renders it as the city\''s cultural, political and commercial epicenter. A wide berth of entertainment and culinary options await one and all at the heart of this vibrant neighborhood. Part of the windswept Malecon rolls into El Centro from Old Town, and the Monumento El Caballito dominates its stretch. Not far away, the Naval Museum and the adobe-shaped Galería Uno are located.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">5 De Deciembre</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hemmed by the Hotel Zone and El Centro, the 5 De Deciembre neighborhood enjoys a more laid-back vibe compared to its other more popular counterparts. Those who wish themselves some down time can relax on cabanas and decks at the pebble-beach wonder of Playa Camarones. Surrounding the beach along Avenida Colombia is an assemblage of small taco restaurants, local bars, and motels that offer uninterrupted view of the Bahia de Banderas.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Marina Vallarta</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Located to the north of the Hotel Zone, this is one of the more swanky spots in town. A host of five-star resorts and hotels stand almost equidistant to one another on a vast stretch of the sandy beach, with a range of condominiums and expensive vacation rentals looming in the backdrop. It is a also a veritable playground for the rich, with several premier world-class golf courses spanning its picturesque sprawl.The Galerias Vallarta, a superb haven for luxury shopping upholds Marina Vallarta\''s indulgent personality.</div>\r\n\r\n<br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 (3131,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Vail Village</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">A sleepy mountain village Vail is not. In fact, it is the beating heart of a year-round calendar of high-altitude cultural events. Each spring, Vail hosts both the Taste of Vail food festival and the Vail Film Festival. Summertime sees the annual six-week Vail Jazz Festival, which culminates with the bang-up Labor Day Weekend Jazz Party. The Vail Oktoberfest is well attended by a well-lubricated bunch year after year. Come winter, the two-week ski-season kick-off party known as Snow Daze starts things really rolling. Once kicked off, the season gets into high gear with other events such as The Session, an action-packed snowboarding extravaganza. If you\''re tired of simply watching the action and would rather participate instead, stop by Double Diamond for everything you\''ll need to take on the power-laden slopes. Summer activities in Vail are no less extreme — let Colorado River Runs take you on a downhill journey of a different sort.  <br><br>For the more culturally inclined, Vail\''s got a lot to offer as well, from galleries showcasing local art to museums celebrating favored pastimes like the Colorado Ski Museum. Additionally, Vail is famous as former the home-away-from-home for the 38th President of the United States and his family; honor this part of Vail\''s heritage by attending a concert at Gerald Ford Amphitheater, or stop to smell the roses at the Betty Ford Alpine Gardens. Beloved, and internationally renowned, local businesses thrive thanks to repeat visits from locals and travelers alike. Stop into Verbatim Booksellers, located inside Sonnenalp Resort, for a peerless book-buying experience or visit Gorsuch for all things Vail.  <br><br>The town is renowned around the world for its fine dining as well. Cutting-edge culinary meccas like Larkspur, and The Left Bank line seemingly every boulevard in the supposedly \"quiet\" mountain town. After so much action and adventure, relax at spas like the Heaven Massage &amp; Spa before retiring to one of Vail\''s many luxurious hotels like the Austria Haus.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lionshead</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lionshead is a bustling, pedestrian-friendly neighborhood in central Vail. It is home to a great glass gondola that ferries thrill seekers to the peak of Vail Mountain all day. Accordingly, this district is packed with ski shops, action sports outlets and outdoor gear outfitters, all offering deals on the finest in equipment and fashion. Vail Ski Tech is one of the best of these, conveniently located right next to the gondola. If you\''re in town at the start of the ski season, take part in the annual Ski Swap, a semi-official kickoff to the season and a great place to hunt for bargains.  <br><br>Given its central location, Lionshead is also home to quite a number of souvenir shops and an endless selection of luxurious accommodations including the Antlers at Vail. From Lionshead, you can also reach Adventure Ridge, a kid-friendly mountain-themed fun park. Visitors of all ages can revel in an action-packed day of snowmobiling, bungee jumping, ice-skating, ski biking, and laser tag. Obviously, with so much to do, Lionshead visitors need some sustenance. Cuisine here ranges from the family-friendly southern-style soul food of Moe\''s Original, to the decidedly more upscale seafood specialties of the Montauk Seafood Grill.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Avon</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just eight miles west of Vail, along the scenic Eagle River, is the Rocky Mountain town of Avon. A relatively small town, the population of Avon increases rapidly during the ski season. Located at the base of the Beaver Creek Ski Resort, Avon is a great destination for those looking to explore the surroundings of Vail.  <br><br>Avon gives its visitors the opportunity to fill their days with numerous outdoor activities. You\''ll no doubt need all the energy you can get, so start your day off right with some caffeine at Loaded Joe\''s. Then, let the Lakota River Guides help you put all that energy to good use, with an outdoor adventure down one of the Vail Valley rivers.  <br><br>There are a number of eateries in Avon, from fine dining restaurants to cafes that are perfect for a quick bite. If you\''re looking for a dining experience that comes with a view, make your way to Grouse Mountain Grill, whose rustically elegant decor is matched by the stellar mountain vistas.  <br><br>If you plan on staying in Avon, there are a number of accommodations that range from the ultra-posh to quaint condominiums. The Ritz-Carlton Bachelor Gulch is a beautiful resort that provides its guest with top-notch service with one of the best ski-in ski-out experiences in the US. For a more personal, homelike stay, the Falcon Point Resort offers two or three bedroom condos right on the shores of Lake Nottingham, making it an appropriate choice for both winter and summer visits.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Leadville</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">The historic town of Leadville has a past not nearly as long as the list of activities it accompanies. Wilderness abounds in this mountainous town, with pristine alpine lakes, snow-covered peaks, and rippling streams beneath skies of astounding blue.  <br><br>If you happen to find yourself in Leadville during the holiday season, it would be in your best interest not to miss the Old Fashioned Christmas. The Victorian style homes and buildings that remain from heydays of Leadville\''s mining era make the atmosphere make for the ideal environs for a perfect yuletide celebration. Continue on with the winter festivities as Leadville plays host to the Off-Track Off-Beat Snowshoe Run.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beaver Creek</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Here, the mountains truly come alive. Lodgings manage to blend resort-style comfort with rustic, woodsy atmospheres. Try the Beaver Creek Lodge or Creekside. For a rustic dinner, take advantage of Beaver Creek\''s mountaintop dining options. Allie\''s and Beano\''s are frontier cabins in which adventurous foodies can experience fine dining right on the slopes. Back in town, relish a steak at The Dusty Boot, or a distinctive pie at Blue Moose Pizza. Proper connoisseurs might want to schedule their visit to coincide with the Beaver Creek International Culinary Classic - an acclaimed annual cooking competition. Obviously, so much activity might require a measure of respite. If so, make an appointment at one of Beaver Creek\''s several renowned spas - the Allegria</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Eagle</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Eagle is the site of a number of exciting entertainment choices. Many of them involve heart-pounding, calorie-burning adventures, so be sure to load up on some hearty Italian cuisine at La Scala beforehand. Afterward, hit up Beaver Divers, a high-elevation dive shop that will outfit you with everything you need for a thrilling and curiously unusual dive. Prefer to keep your head above water? Camelot Balloons will take you <em>way</em> above, and thrill you with dazzling views of the Vail Valley from a lofty perspective. The whole family can get in on the act at The Back Bowl. More than just an average bowling alley, this place bills itself as a \"Family Entertainment Center\" complete with video arcades, live entertainment and even gourmet dining.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Edwards</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fifteen miles west of Vail lies the thriving residential town of Edwards. Its local culture and strong sense of community are never more evident than at the annual Cinco de Mayo celebration.  <br><br>That is not to say Edwards is not accommodating to travelers. Plenty of attractions keep people pouring in from far and wide. Children in tow? Meet the Wilderness is an organization dedicated to introducing young people to the joys of the unexplored. Enroll your little ones in a program, or volunteer to contribute your own time and expertise.  <br><br>When so much adventure gets tiresome, one can always fall back on Edwards\'' superb selection of shopping destinations. For that special occasion, try Kimberley\''s Fine Jewelry. Pamper yourself even more with a stay at The Lodge &amp; Spa at Cordillera, where amenities include all the comforts of resort living, alongside in-house restaurants. Speaking of pubs and pub grub, to focus your attention more exclusively on Colorado\''s contributions to the world of beer, hoist a pint at Gore Range Brewery, a local favorite.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Others</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">A host of other small towns and communities speckle the Vail Valley, each with their own distinctive charm. While Bachelor Gulch boasts of fantastic ski-in/ski-out access, Arrowhead is a fine choice for those who enjoy tennis, swimming and golf besides winter sports. Cordillera is another popular choice for golf enthusiasts, as is East Vail.</div>\r\n\r\n<br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 (3133,'<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Saint John</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Saint John houses the island\''s capital, a bustling port where commerce thrives. For the most part, St. John\''s looks like what you\''d expect from a commercial and tourist hub. Colorful, sun-bleached shops line narrow streets also claimed by energetic, seasoned vendors. Older businesses mingle with newer construction, and considerable locals plus daily cruise activity means steady foot traffic. <br><br>You\''ll have no trouble finding amenities and accommodations in St. John\''s, which also houses top sights like the Museum of Antigua &amp; Barbuda and Fort James. As capital cities go, this one is exceptionally walkable: you can get to the Antigua Recreation Ground situated just outside the city in about ten minutes heading south from the waterfront, and while downtown, you\''re only about 15 minutes by car from V. C. Bird International Airport.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Saint George</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Immediately east of Saint John, Saint George is familiar to most as the site of V.C. Bird International Airport. It is otherwise comprised predominantly of small towns that remain mostly separate from the popular tourist areas. Local gems worth checking out include the St. George\''s Anglican Church and Coolidge Cricket Ground.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Saint Peter</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Parham is the capital city of the Saint Peter parish, as well as the first British settlement established on the island. Its oldest structures date back to the 1800s, and visitors can enjoy Betty\''s Hope Sugar Plantation for some history-filled fun while touring the area. They can also enjoy spectacular wildlife, particularly the colorful species found swimming in the reefs just offshore. See if you can do some island hopping while exploring the waters around Saint Peter for a guaranteed great time.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Saint Phillip</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Scenic and serene, Saint Phillip was an obvious choice for the cherished resorts that line its idyllic seaside. Beaches are the reason most flock to the parish, notably Half Moon Bay, which strikes a nice balance between offering amenities like tasty food and maintaining an immaculate, isolated allure. Splash in the Atlantic and explore every limestone crevice in Saint Phillip to make the most of what the area has to offer.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Saint Paul</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Saint Paul is the venerable core of vibrant Antigua. When you cross into the parish, be sure to stop in Falmouth, then head to the docks to admire the massive yachts. Keep on to where the road ends and you\''ll discover historic Nelson\''s Dockyard, which fringes English Harbour. This piece of living history is the world\''s only fully preserved Georgian Naval dockyard, tracing all the way back to the 1700s. Many of the buildings housed here are open to the public, including two small inns, a museum, the Galley Bar and Boutique, a tiny bakery, and more.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Saint Mary</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the larger parishes, Saint Mary sees a fair number of visitors. They tend toward Mount Obama, the island\''s tallest point, and Jolly Harbour, a resort town best known for its marina, 18-hole championship golf course, and sandy stretches. The most popular beaches in Saint Mary include Jolly Beach and Ffryes Beach. Outdoor enthusiasts will also be thrilled to explore the volcanic landscape and soak in the vistas across this picturesque parish.</div>\r\n\r\n<br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Many of the original residents still live in Ticinese and there are many <em>case di ringhiera</em> - apartments with wrought-iron balconies that face inwards. Once the 20th-century abode of blue-collar employees, these renovated apartments now house architects, artists, fashion designers <em>et al</em>. This area is full of bars and shops selling new and vintage clothes, antiques, furniture, as well as basic necessities.  <br><br>The <em>Navigli</em>, the city\''s canal system, includes the Naviglio Grande and the Naviglio Pavese. A short way down the Naviglio Pavese is Via Chiesa Rossa, shaped by the wave of immigrants who settled here in the 1950s and 1960s. The area by the Navigli teems with nightclubs, bars, and pubs, forever bustling with an exuberant energy, especially during the summertime.

Viale Lazio is predominantly made up of residential, leafy avenues; Corso Lodi reverberates with the hum of commercial activity; Viale Umbria is residential and Corso XXII Marzo is filled with shops. Some fashion houses have their headquarters in Vittoria, around Viale Umbria and Corso Lodi. There is still some industrial activity to the east, on Viale Mugello and towards Viale Molise (the large complex of Macello Comunale) and further out, while nearby is the famous wholesale market, Mercato Ortofrutticolo. Further east, between Forlanini\''s verdant park and Taliedo (heading towards Linate Airport), is the <em>Idroscalo</em>, a large dock filled with water where you can swim, sunbathe, and sail.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Città Studi</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">Città Studi is located in the east of Milan and as the name suggests, is the University district, home to the Polytechnic, and several chemistry, biology and pharmaceutical departments. Many of the buildings here were constructed in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s and the overall feel is that of a charming residential area with trees on every street.</div>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Isola</h3>\r\n<div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the north of the city lies Isola, located just behind the Stazione Centrale, other zones in the vicinity are home to large hospital complexes, such as Ospedale Maggiore di Milano Policlinico and CTO.</div>\r\n\r\n<br><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">&copy; Cityseeker</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
