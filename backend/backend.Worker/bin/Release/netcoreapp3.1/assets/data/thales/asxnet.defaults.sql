Around 1500 BC the area was settled by the Nahuas, a tribe related to the Nahuatl, who populated much of southern Mexico. The Nahuatl language provided the name Acapulco, meaning \"place of canes\" or \"reeds.\" Although it is generally accepted that the first nonnatives to reach Acapulco were Spaniards led by Hernán Cortés, some local historians claim that a Chinese monk named Fa Hsein predated Cortés by 100 years.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From 1565 to 1815 the Spanish maintained a thriving port and trading center in Acapulco. Spanish galleons returning from Asia, primarily the Philippines and China, delivered silks, porcelain, jade, jasmine, and spices. These goods were then carried over land on a 6-foot-wide trail to the Mexico gulf coast town of Veracruz for shipment to Spain. Many pirate ships lurked outside Acapulco Bay, making the Pacific voyages a risky business.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Acapulco became a town in 1799, but started to decline with the War of Independence, when locals sided with the Spanish royalists. Insurgent leader José María Morelos showed his displeasure by burning much of the town in 1814. Independence from Spain and a changing world rendered the trade route obsolete.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The town remained in relative obscurity until 1927, when a road was built connecting the port to Mexico City and bringing the first tourists. It wasn\'t long before Hollywood celebrities and other wealthy world travelers started to arrive, and Acapulco began its transformation. One of the first to recognize the potential of the area was then Mexico President Miguel Alemán, who purchased miles of undeveloped coastline. He in turn sold a portion of the land to billionaire oil magnate J. Paul Getty, who built a lavish getaway for himself and his friends—now the Fairmont Pierre Marqués Hotel on Playa Revolcadero.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">By the 1960s it seemed everyone in Hollywood was vacationing in Acapulco: Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, Leslie Caron, Cary Grant, Lana Turner, John Wayne, Errol Flynn, Brigitte Bardot, Elvis Presley, Elizabeth Taylor... too many names to list. World leaders, artists, and writers were also frequent visitors, including John, Robert, and Edward Kennedy, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, the Reverend Billy Graham, Salvador Dalí, Tennessee Williams, and John Huston. To read about the long celebrity history of Acapulco, as well as a great account of how the town has grown, pick up a copy of the book <i>Mike Oliver\'s Acapulco.</i> Oliver, who died in 2004, published the English-language <i>Acapulco News</i> for decades, and knew and socialized with all of Acapulco\'s celebrity visitors.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Acapulco today, although not the Hollywood hangout of times past, is still a major tourist destination, especially with Mexican nationals, who make up about 80% of its visitors. Most people will acknowledge that early city planners allowed too much beachfront development, forever changing the visual and aesthetic landscape, but the sun, sand, and culture of this vibrant and historic city still attract fun-seekers by the millions.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

However, for a taste of the real South Australia a trip to a national park or to the Outback is definitely worth the extra travel time. Short flights between destinations make any journey possible within a day or overnight, but the more time you leave yourself to explore the virtues of this underrated state, the better.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend a leisurely day in <b>Adelaide</b> enjoying the museums and historic sights, as well as the bustling Central Market. Take a sunset stroll along the Torrens, then have dinner and drinks at one of the city\'s vibrant restaurants or wine bars. Spend the night, then take Day 2 to tour the <b>Adelaide Hills,</b> strolling the 19th-century streets of <b>Hahndorf</b> and other villages and taking in the panorama from atop <b>Mt. Lofty.</b> Stay the night in a charming bed-and-breakfast in one of the region\'s small towns, or come back down to North Adelaide and rest among the beautiful sandstone homes. Save Day 3 for wine tasting in the <b>Barossa Region.</b></div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 5 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After exploring Adelaide for a day, expand your horizons beyond the city and take a tram-car ride to the beach at Glenelg, where you can laze on the white sands and dine at tasty outposts. Spend the night here or at a B&amp;B on the <b>Fleurieu Peninsula,</b> then take Day 3 to explore the vineyards and catch the ferry to <b>Kangaroo Island.</b> After a night here, use Day 4 to explore and appreciate the island\'s wildlife and untamed beauty. Return to Adelaide in the afternoon on Day 5 and drive up to the <b>Adelaide Hills</b> for sunset at <b>Mt. Lofty.</b></div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 7 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend Day 1 in <b>Adelaide</b> nosing through museums and picnicking in a park or on the banks of the River Torrens. After a night in the city, head into the leafy <b>Adelaide Hills</b> to meet nocturnal Australian wildlife at Warrawong Wildlife Sanctuary. Stay the night in a local B&amp;B, then on Day 3 travel to the <b>Barossa Region,</b> where German and English influences are strong and the dozens of wineries offer tempting free tastings. Spend the evening at a country house, then on Day 4 cross to <b>Kangaroo Island.</b> Stay two nights, giving you Day 5 to fully explore the island\'s remote corners and unwind. On Day 6, plunge into the Outback at extraordinary <b>Coober Pedy</b> (consider flying to maximize your time). There you can eat, shop, and stay the night underground as the locals do and \"noodle\" (rummage) for opal gemstones. If you\'re a hiker, consider heading for <b>Flinders Ranges National Park</b> on Day 7 to explore one of the country\'s finest Outback parks.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Top Reasons to Go</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Arts &amp; Music</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Adelaide\'s Festival Centre is the focus of the city\'s cultural life. Its name hints at the highlight of South Australia\'s arts calendar—the biennial Adelaide Festival of Arts, a tremendously successful celebration that was the forerunner to other artistic festivities throughout Australia. Beginning a week before is the Adelaide Fringe, presenting all that\'s new in the independent arts. Adelaide also hosts the internationally acclaimed youth festival Come Out in off-festival years, and the annual WOMADelaide celebration of world music. Country towns and regions have their own festivals, the most notable of which is the Barossa Under the Stars music concert each February.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bush Tucker</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">South Australia, along with the Northern Territory, led the way in educating the Australian palate in the pleasures of bush tucker—the wild foods in the Australian countryside that have been used for millennia by the Aboriginal people. Kangaroo, crocodile, emu, and other regional fare were introduced to a skeptical public who now embrace it and seek ever more inventive preparations of native ingredients. Many menus also have local seafood, especially tuna, King George whiting, and oysters from the waters of Spencer Gulf and the Great Australian Bight, the expanse of ocean off Australia\'s curved central southern coast.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Historic Homes</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Adelaide\'s accommodations are bargains compared with those in any other Australian capital city. Even so, you might consider staying outside the city in one of the historic properties in North Adelaide or in the Adelaide Hills to have the best of both worlds: easy access to the pleasures of the city as well as to the vineyards, orchards, and rustic villages that are tucked away in this idyllic, rolling landscape. Wonderfully restored 19th-century homes and guesthouses are plentiful in Adelaide and throughout the state.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoor Escapes</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kangaroo Island\'s Flinders Chase and the Outback\'s Flinders Ranges national parks are great places to take in South Australia\'s geographical diversity. Coastal expanses and seascapes stretch into lowland meadows and open forests toward rugged Outback mountain terrain. Australian creatures abound at Cleland Wildlife Park. Carry water in this dry state, and drink it often—the heat is deceptively dehydrating.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wonderful Wines</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">South Australia is considered Australia\'s premier wine state, and produces more than half the total Australian vintage. The premium wines of the Barossa Region, Clare Valley, McLaren Vale, Adelaide Hills, and Coonawarra are treasured by connoisseurs worldwide, and many South Australian producers and wines have been awarded international honors. Whether or not you make it to any cellar doors, be sure to schedule a trip to the National Wine Centre in Adelaide to get a good working knowledge of Australian wines. Then test your knowledge by ordering a glass with dinner.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Coober Pedy: Australia\'s Opal Capital</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Known as much for the way most of its 3,500 inhabitants live—underground in dugouts gouged into the hills—as for its opal riches, Coober Pedy is arguably Australia\'s most singular place. The town is ringed by mullock heaps, pyramids of rock and sand left over after mining shafts are dug.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Opals are Coober Pedy\'s reason for existence. Australia has 95% of the world\'s opal deposits, and Coober Pedy has the bulk of that wealth; this is the world\'s richest opal field.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Opal was discovered here in 1915, and soldiers returning from World War I excavated the first dugout homes when the searing heat forced them underground. In midsummer temperatures can reach 48°C (118°F), but inside the dugouts the air remains a constant 22°C-24°C (72°F-75°F).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Coober Pedy is a brick-and-corrugated-iron settlement propped unceremoniously on a scarred desert landscape. It\'s a town built for efficiency, not beauty. However, its ugliness has a kind of bizarre appeal. There\'s a feeling that you\'re in the last lawless outpost in the modern world, helped in no small part by the local film lore—<i>Priscilla Queen of the Desert, Pitch Black, Kangaroo Jack,</i> and <i>Mad Max 3</i> were filmed here. Once you go off the main street you get an immediate sense of the apocalyptic.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fossicking for opal gemstones—locally called noodling—requires no permit at the Jewelers Shop mining area at the edge of town. Take care in unmarked areas and always watch your step, as the area is littered with abandoned opal mines down which you might fall. (Working mines are off-limits to visitors.)</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although most of Coober Pedy\'s devotions are decidedly material in nature, the town does have its share of spiritual houses of worship. Keeping with the town\'s layout, they, too, are underground. <b>St. Peter and St. Paul\'s Catholic Church</b> is a National Heritage-listed building, and the <b>Catacomb Anglican Church</b> is notable for its altar fashioned from a windlass (a winch) and lectern made from a log of mulga wood. The <b>Serbian Orthodox Church</b> is striking, with its scalloped ceiling, rock-carved icons, and brilliant stained-glass windows. The <b>Revival Fellowship Underground Church,</b> adjacent to the Experience Motel, has lively gospel services.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

In the 1940s the winery branched out from sacramental wine into commercial production, and today 14 wine varieties, including Riesling (try the St Aloysius label), verdelho, grenache, and fortified wines, account for 75% of its business. Book a guided tour with the charming Brother John May, Jesuit Winemaker Emeritus, who takes you to the cellars, the cemetery, and the church crypt where Jesuits have been interred since 1865. You can also rent bicycles here to explore the rolling hills and vineyards. www.sevenhillcellars.com.au. COST: Free, tours A$5.

About 300 animals usually lounge on the beach, except on stormy days, when they shelter in the dunes. You can only visit the beach, and get surprisingly close to females, pups, and bulls, on a tour with an interpretive officer; otherwise, you can follow the self-guided boardwalk to a lookout over the sand. Two-hour sunset tours depart on varied days in December and January; a minimum of four people is required, as is 24-hour advance booking. The park visitor center has fun and educational displays, and a touch table covered in sea lion skins and bones. There is also a shop. COST: Group tour A$13 per person, sunset tour A$31, boardwalk A$9.50. OPEN: Tours Dec. and Jan., daily 9-5:15, every 15-45 mins; Feb.-Nov., daily 9-4:15, every 45 mins. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mail Run Tour</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Coober Pedy-Oodnadatta Mail Run Tour, a 12-hour, 600-km (372-mi) tour through the Outback (A$165), is one of the most unusual experiences anywhere. Tours depart at 8:45 AM from Underground Books on Post Office Hill Road. www.mailruntour.com. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The phad is a red, green, and yellow scroll depicting the life of a local hero; the dark and richly hued pichwais, hung in temples, are cloth paintings depicting Lord Krishna in different moods.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Equally popular are reproductions of mandana art, designs traditionally drawn by women on the walls and floors of rural homes using a chalk solution on a crimson cow-dung background. These unique works are ritual decorations for festivals and ceremonial occasions. Udaipur has the biggest and best selection of miniature paintings, and is considered a center for this traditional art. Whether on paper, silk, marble, or bone, these astonishingly intricate works depict wildlife and courtly scenes, and illustrations of religious stories and mythological themes. Originally created by the chittrekar (artist) community, miniatures now usually blend both Rajput and Moghul styles. Building on the Rajputs\' bright colors and courtly themes, the Moghuls added more detail to the faces and the landscapes.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals in Rajasthan and Gujarat</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Pushkar camel fair is in November, the Shekhawati art festival in December, the Jaisalmer desert festival in January, Jaipur\'s Gangaur festival and Udaipur\'s Mewar festival are in April, and Mount Abu\'s summer festival in May.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Makar Sankranti—the point when the sun reaches the Tropic of Capricorn after the winter solstice—is celebrated on January 14 with a tremendous kite festival in Ahmedabad. A dance festival is organized immediately afterward at Modhera\'s sun temple, about 100 km (62 mi) north of Ahmedabad.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Navaratri, the goddess festival, in late September or early October, is celebrated throughout the state with performances of Ras Garba, Gujarat\'s folk dance, nowadays often embellished with disco moves and amplified music. Rhythmic dances, often using sticks and graceful movements, by young and old in extraordinarily colorful and elaborate costumes makes Garba, also called Dandiya and Ras Garba, a treat to watch. Tarnetar, northeast of Rajkot in the center of the Kathiawar Peninsula, is the site of a large folk fair in October or November. Diwali—end of the year festival of lights (falling sometime between October-December) marking the return of the epic hero Rama from exile with his wife, Sita—is celebrated distinctively here by the Jains, as is the birthday of their founder, Mahavira, in April.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.  All rights reserved.</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(28,'<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ranthambhore National Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Now incorporating several nearby sanctuaries in its borders, the spectacular Ranthambhore National Park encompasses 1,334 square km (515 square mi). The rugged Aravalli and Vindhya hills, highland boulder plateaus, and lakes and rivers provide homes for hundreds of species of birds, mammals, and reptiles. Ranthambhore is noted for its tiger and leopard population, although you still have only a 30% to 40% chance of seeing a large cat on any given expedition. The best time to see tigers is right before the monsoon, in summer, when the tigers emerge to drink from small water holes. (When it\'s dry and the water table is low, the tigers are forced out of hiding to quench their thirst.) What you will definitely see are numerous peacocks, sambar (large Asian deer), <i>chital</i> (spotted axis deer), <i>chinkara</i> (gazelle), wild pigs, jackals, crocodiles, and often sloth bears.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sighting a wild tiger in Ranthambhore is an exciting experience: if you\'re lucky, open jeeps sometimes take you as close as 10 feet away from an animal. Before that, of course, you will hear the jungle sounds that warn of a tiger\'s presence. Monkeys and peacocks scream loudly and the deer in the area become agitated and nervous. Despite conservation efforts, the tiger population in Ranthambhore is small: there are less than 40 of the great amber-eyed cats in the reserve. Sighting a leopard is much more difficult, as these cats live on high, inaccessible slopes and are extremely shy.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The park is run by the Indian government, and the rules are inflexible: you can only enter the park in an official government jeep, and the jeeps keep strict hours, daily from 6:30 AM to 9:30 AM and 3:30 PM to 6:30 PM. Book a jeep two months in advance—there\'s heavy demand for them. (If you make bookings through your hotel, expect a service charge.) In the off-hours, you can explore the surrounding region; the 10th century <b>Ranthambhore Fort,</b> perched on a nearby hill, is one of Rajasthan\'s more spectacular military strongholds. You could also visit Dastkar, a craft-and-textile shop on the Ranthambhore Road, run by a nongovernmental organization.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Within the park is a government-run hotel called <b>Jhoomar Baori</b> (12 rooms, Rs. 650-Rs. 800) offers the chance to spend a night near the animals, but little else. A better option is to stay at one of the hotels along Ranthambhore Road. The neighboring town of Sawai Madhopur has numerous hotels, but most are extremely basic. www.rajasthantourism.gov.in. COST: Rs. 391 per person; up to 6 people per jeep. OPEN: Oct.-June. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mehrangarh Fort</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the top of a hill, this enormous fort was built by Rao Jodha in 1459, when he shifted his capital from Mandore to Jodhpur. Looking straight down a perpendicular cliff, the famously impregnable fort is an imposing landmark, especially at night, when it\'s bathed in yellow light. Approach the fort by climbing a steep walkway, passing under no fewer than eight huge gates. (If you\'re not up for the 40-minute hike, you can take auto-rickshaw instead for about Rs. 30-Rs. 40.) The first, the Victory Gate, was built by Maharaja Ajit Singh to commemorate his military success against the Moghuls at the beginning of the 18th century; the other seven commemorate victories over other Rajput states. The last gate, as in many Rajput forts, displays the haunting handprints of women who immolated themselves after their husbands were defeated in battle.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Inside the rugged fort, delicate latticed windows and pierced sandstone screens are the surprising motifs. The palaces—<b>Moti Mahal</b> (Pearl Palace), <b>Phool Mahal</b> (Flower Palace), <b>Sheesh Mahal</b> (Glass Palace), and the other apartments—are exquisitely decorated; their ceilings, walls, and even floors are covered with murals, mirror work, and gilt. The palace museum has exquisite rooms filled with lavish royal elephant carriages (howdahs), palanquins, thrones, paintings, and even a giant tent. It also has an interesting weapons gallery. From the ramparts you can get an excellent city view; the blue houses at sunset look magical. The fort is possibly the best maintained historic property in all Rajasthan, and offers an audio tour with headphones (included in the admission price, for foreigners) with recorded commentary in six languages, including English. www.mehrangarh.org. COST: Rs. 250 (including audio tour), cameras free, video-cameras fee Rs. 200. OPEN: Daily 9-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Keoladeo National Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Founded by the Jat ruler Suraj Mal in 1733, the city of Bharatpur is famous for the Keoladeo National Park (also known as the Ghana Bird Sanctuary), once the duck-hunting forest of the local maharajas. The park is home to mammals and reptiles—blue bulls, spotted deer, otters, and Indian rock pythons—but birds are the main attraction. This famous waterbird haven is an ornithologist\'s dream—29 square km (10 square mi) of forests and wetlands with 400 species, more than 130 of which are resident year-round, such as the Saras crane, gray heron, snake bird, and spoonbill. In winter, birds arrive from the Himalayas, Siberia, and even Europe.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The best way to see the park is on foot or by boat (Rs. 75), but there are plenty of other options. The park\'s main artery is a blacktop road that runs from the entrance gate to the center. Surrounded by marshlands but screened by bushes, this road is the most convenient viewpoint for bird-watching, and is also traveled by cycle-rickshaws (Rs. 50 per hour), a horse and buggy, and the park\'s electric bus (Rs. 25 per person). The rickshaw drivers, trained by the forest department, are fairly good at finding and pointing out birds. You can also rent a bicycle and head into more remote areas; just remember that most roads are unpaved. The excellent guides at the gate (Rs. 120 per excursion) are familiar with the birds\' haunts, and can help you spot and identify them.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Try to bring a bird guidebook: former royal-family member Salim Ali\'s <i>The Birds of India</i> is a good choice. The best time to see the birds is early morning or late evening, November through February; by the end of February, many birds start heading home. Stick around at sunset, when the water takes on a mirrorlike stillness and the air is filled with the calls of day birds settling down and night birds stirring. COST: Park Rs. 200, camera fee Rs. 10, video-camera fee Rs. 200. OPEN: Park daily 6AM-6:30PM. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fort</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">What\'s extraordinary about this fort is that 5,000 people still live here, just as they did centuries ago. Some 250 feet above the town, the fort is protected by a 30-foot-high wall and contains 99 bastions. Several great <i>pols</i> (gateways) approach and jut outward from the battlements of this 12th-century citadel. Built of sandstone and extremely brittle, the fort is rumored to be an architectural time bomb, destined to collapse in the face of a particularly aggressive sandstorm. So lovely is this structure that the poet Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) composed <i>Sonar Kila</i> (<i>The Golden Fort</i>) after seeing it, and inspired another creative Bengali in turn—Satyajit Ray made his famous film by the same name after reading Tagore\'s work.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Inside the web of tiny lanes are Jain and Hindu temples, palaces, and charming havelis. The seven-story <b>Juna Mahal</b> (Old Palace), built around 1500, towers over the other buildings. The <b>Satiyon ka Pagthiya</b> (Steps of the Satis), just before the palace entrance, is where the royal ladies committed <i>sati,</i> self-immolation, when their husbands were slain.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Within the fort are eight <b>Jain temples</b> (COST: Free. OPEN: Daily 7AM-noon), built from the 12th to 16th centuries, which house thousands of carved deities and dancing figures in mythological settings. No photography is allowed here, and you\'ll have to leave your leather items at the gate (Jains worship life in all forms, so leather is sacrilegious). The <b>Gyan Bhandar</b> (COST: Free. OPEN: Daily 10AM-11AM), inside the Jain temple complex contains more than 1,000 old manuscripts—some from the 12th century, written on palm leaf, with painted wooden covers—and a collection of Jain, pre-Moghul, and Rajput paintings. The historic <b>Tazia Tower</b> is a delicate pagoda rising five tiers from the <b>Badal Mahal</b> (Cloud Palace), each tier designed to include an intricately carved balcony. Muslim craftsmen built the tower in the shape of a <i>tazia</i>—a replica of a bier carried in procession during Mohurram, a Muslim period of mourning. COST: Rs. 5.

Exploring the New York State Capitol, the Empire State Plaza and its attractions and artworks, the Albany Heritage Area Visitors Center, and the Lark Street area consumes most of Day 1. On Day 2 either head south of the plaza and visit Historic Cherry Hill and the Schuyler Mansion State Historic Site or head north of the plaza and see the Ten Broeck Mansion and then, if the weather\'s nice, the Corning Preserve.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Alternatively, you could head out of town on Day 2 and tour <b>Saratoga Springs</b>. If you have tickets to a performance at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, you can spend the good part of the day browsing through the shops. Have an early dinner before heading to your show.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Follow the two-day itinerary above, spending both days in <b>Albany</b> -. On Day 2, in the late afternoon, drive north to <b>Saratoga Springs</b>. In the evening, go for a concert at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center or at the much smaller Spa Little Theatre; if you\'re really keen on seeing a certain performance, be sure to buy tickets in advance. Spend the next morning strolling through downtown and Congress Park. If you\'re visiting during racing season, head straight for the Saratoga Race Course for an early breakfast and then relax until the first race. If you\'re feeling energetic, consider visiting the Saratoga National Historical Park/Battlefield in the afternoon.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 4 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend two days in <b>Albany</b> -, following the suggestions in the two-day itinerary above. On Day 3, explore the Historic Stockade District in <b>Schenectady</b>, tour the RiverSpark Visitor Center in <b>Troy</b>, or go hiking in <b>John Boyd Thacher State Park</b>. In the evening, head north to <b>Saratoga Springs</b> (follow the suggestions in the three-day itinerary).</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pleasures & Pastimes</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Summertime Shows</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Summer is the season for music and entertainment, from weekend-long jazz festivals to dance performances. Many events—such as the Live at Five concert series at the Corning Preserve, in Albany—are free, whereas others charge moderate fees with no extra charge for children. Both the New York City Ballet and the Philadelphia Orchestra hold summer residencies at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, a cultural gem that hosts pop, rock, and jazz concerts as well. Opera and chamber-music festivals are held at the Spa Little Theatre, part of Saratoga Spa State Park. Parks in Schenectady and nearby Scotia also host outdoor concerts.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The 45-minute guided tour highlights the ornate Great Western Staircase (aka the Million Dollar Staircase)—which took 13 years and 600 stone carvers to complete—and, right over it, a 3,000-square-foot skylight that had been covered from World War II until 2002. Amid the carved faces adorning the staircase pillars are several famous visages. You can visit the legislative chambers and, when open, the governor\'s ceremonial offices.

In the 1920s and \'30s, it had been a bona fide retail and entertainment district and mixed-use neighborhood. But through the 1950s and \'60s, demographic patterns shifted. Middle- and upper-income residents moved farther from downtown, and Albuquerque sprawled, with much of the city taking on the almost suburban appearance that prevails today. By the 1980s, most people had stopped shopping and playing downtown, and most of the largely abandoned blocks were razed in favor of office towers and parking garages. Into the late \'90s, downtown was an empty and occasionally unsafe streetscape on weekends and after 6 PM.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fast-forward to the present. Many U.S. cities have experienced downtown renaissances, and the traditional recipe has been to anchor the neighborhood with a sports and entertainment complex, a few cultural attractions, and a slew of high-profile shopping and restaurant franchises. Albuquerque\'s downtown planners have largely shunned this quick-fix approach. Local developers have attracted independently owned shops, restaurants, and nightclubs and converted former schools and manufacturing buildings into residential lofts and condos. The Spanish colonial-style Alvarado Transportation Center—designed after the old Fred Harvey-run Alvarado Hotel that once stood here—with car rentals, a taxi stand, Greyhound, Amtrak, and local city buses, is a bustling enterprise. The transportation center is also the hub for the state\'s spanking-new commuter-rail service, the Rail Runner Express.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Downtown\'s transformation has been gradual, but people have begun to notice. Visitors now wander along Central and Gold avenues, appreciating the architectural and neon holdouts from the area\'s retro roots, checking out the numerous new galleries, bars, and restaurants, walking over to the restored KiMo Theatre or the snazzy 14-screen movie palace. You\'re no longer warned to stay off downtown streets at night. It\'s exciting to watch this neighborhood come back to life.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The \"Common Ground\" galleries represent an important permanent collection of primarily 20th-century paintings, all by world-renowned artists with a New Mexico connection. Changing exhibits also reveal a commitment to historically important artists and photographers of the 20th and 21st centuries. The centerpiece,\"Four Centuries: A History of Albuquerque,\" is a pair of life-size models of Spanish conquistadors in original chain mail and armor. Perhaps the one on horseback is Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, who, in search of gold, led a small army into New Mexico in 1540—a turning point in the region\'s history. A multimedia presentation chronicles the development of the city since 1875. The sculpture garden contains more than 50 contemporary works by Southwestern artists that include Glenna Goodacre, Michael Naranjo, and Luís Jiménez. Visitors may also take advantage of three tours, all offered at no additional charge with admission. Each takes 45 minutes to an hour. www.albuquerquemuseum.com.

The museum\'s late founder, Ross Ward, spent more than 40 years carving and collecting the hundreds of figures that populate this cheerfully bizarre museum, including an animated miniature Western village, a Boot Hill cemetery, and a 1940s circus exhibit. Ragtime piano music, a 40-foot sailboat, and a life-size general store are other highlights. The walls surrounding this 22-room museum have been fashioned out of more than 50,000 glass bottles pressed into cement. This homage to folk art, found art, and eccentric kitsch tends to strike a chord with people of all ages. As you might expect, the gift shop offers plenty of fun oddities. www.tinkertown.com. COST: $3. OPEN: Apr.-Oct., daily 9-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">National Hispanic Cultural Center</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A showpiece for the city, and a showcase for Latino culture and genealogy in Albuquerque\'s old Barelas neighborhood, this exciting contemporary space contains a museum and art galleries, multiple performance venues, a 10,000-volume genealogical research center and library, a restaurant, and an education center. Exhibits include dynamic displays of photography and paintings by local artists as well as by internationally known names. The center mounts performances of flamenco dancing, bilingual theater, traditional Spanish and New Mexican music, world music, the symphony, and more. This is the largest Latino cultural center in the country, and with a $10 million programming endowment (Rita Moreno and Edward James Olmos are among the notables on the national board), the center provides top-notch entertainment in its stunning and acoustically superb Roy E. Disney Center for Performing Arts and smaller Albuquerque Journal Theatre, and hosts major traveling art exhibits in its first-rate museum, which also houses an esteemed permanent collection. Architecturally, the center borrows from a variety of Spanish cultures, from Moorish Spain (including a re-creation of a defensive tower, or Torreón; the finely detailed fresco that embellishes the interior\'s 45-foot-tall walls and ceiling depicts Hispanic cultural heritage through time) to Mexico and the American Southwest. There\'s a vintage WPA-era school that now contains the research library and<b> del Bosque restaurant</b> ($$, no dinner), which serves solid New Mexican fare indoors and out on the patio; Sunday brunch, live music included, draws a big family crowd. The gift shop, La Tiendita, has a well-chosen and impeccably sourced selection of books, pottery, and artwork. www.nhccnm.org. COST: $3. OPEN: Tues.-Sun. 10-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">KiMo Theatre</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When the KiMo was built, in 1927, Route 66 was barely established and running on its original alignment: north-south on 4th Street. Downtown was the center of activity, and movie palaces were the national rage. Local merchant Oreste Bachechi saw his moment, and hired architect Carl Boller to design a theater that would reflect the local zeitgeist. And that he did. Decorated with light fixtures made from buffalo skulls (the eye sockets glow amber in the dark), Navajo symbols, and nine spectacular Western-themed wall murals by Carl Von Hassler, the KiMo represents Pueblo Deco at its apex. Luckily, it was saved from the wrecking ball in 1977, and now, fully restored, it stands—one of the few notable early-20th-century structures in downtown Albuquerque remaining. The self-guided tour is a must, or even better, catch a live performance. www.cabq.gov/kimo. COST: Free self-guided tours.

The significance of these sacred sites is best discovered on a walking tour led by Aboriginal guides, who will point out ancient rock and cave paintings, tell stories, and perhaps introduce you to such true Outback bush tucker as witchetty grubs.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Amazing Geology</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Uluru and Kata Tjuta are the Red Centre\'s most fascinating geological features, but there are many more natural wonders—evidence of past inland seas, of uplift and erosion, and of cataclysmic events. In the MacDonnell Ranges, gorges and plunging chasms cradle crystal-clear water holes, while oases of thousands of cabbage palms thrive in Palm Valley. Towering red walls and sheer quartzite cliffs make spectacular scenery for hikes like the breathtaking Kings Canyon rim walk.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Desert Camping</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sleeping in the desert under a full moon and the Southern Cross is an experience that you will carry with you for the rest of your life. Few travelers realize that far more stars and other astronomical sights, like the fascinating Magellanic Clouds, are visible in the southern hemisphere than in the northern. Nights can be very cold in winter, but the native mulga wood makes for terrific fires, burning hot and long for cooking and for curling up beside in your sleeping bag. A tent is unnecessary in these parts.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outback Grub</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">\"Bush tucker\" and \"Territory tucker\" best describe the unique dishes found on Red Centre menus—be they concoctions made with kangaroo, emu, and crocodile, or with desert fruits and flavorings. Picnics are a delight in the Outback, where national parks provide spectacular backdrops for outdoor meals in the shade of a gum tree or by a water hole. But perhaps the most unique dining experience in the Red Centre is riding a camel along a dry creek bed or across desert sands and then taking your meal by the light of a campfire.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Photo Opportunities</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Landscape photography in the Red Centre is challenging and rewarding. Amazing light and intense colors change throughout the day, and sunset at Uluru is but one of hundreds of panoramic sights that will inspire you to pick up your camera. Heat and dust can be a problem, so be sure to bring insulated, dust-proof bags for your cameras and film stock. Also bring a good UV filter to deflect the fierce light of midday.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

You may recognize it from a scene near the end of <i>Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,</i> when the actors in full drag costume ascend the main path. Sprawling in scope, the canyon\'s sheer cliff walls shelter a world of ferns and woodlands, permanent springs and rock pools. The main path is the 6-km (4-mi) Canyon Walk, which starts with a short but steep climb to the top of the escarpment; the view 886 feet down to the base of the canyon is amazing. The trail then leads through a colony of beehive sandstone domes, known as the Lost City, to a refreshing water hole in the so-called Garden of Eden halfway through the four-hour walk. All this is visible during the half-hour scenic helicopter flight over the canyon and range from Kings Canyon Resort (A$220 or A$115 for 15 minutes). </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kata Tjuta</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many visitors feel that Kata Tjuta is more satisfying to explore than Uluru. Whereas Uluru is one immense block, so you feel as if you\'re always on the outside looking in, Kata Tjuta, as its Aboriginal name (\"many heads\") suggests, is a collection of huge rocks, hiding numerous gorges and chasms that you can enter and explore. There are three main walks, the first from the parking lot into <b>Olga Gorge,</b> the deepest valley between the rocks. This is a 2-km (1-mi) walk, and the round-trip journey takes about one hour. More rewarding but also more difficult is a walk that continues through the major cleft between the Olgas, known as the Valley of the Winds. Experienced walkers can complete this 8-km (5-mi) walk in about four hours. The Valley of the Winds walk is closed when temperatures rise above 36°C (97°F), which is after 11 AM most days in summer. The <b>Kata Tjuta Viewing Area,</b> 25 km (16 mi) along the Kata Tjuta Road, offers a magnificent vista and is a relaxing place for a break. Interpretive panels give you an understanding of the natural life around you. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Uluru</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">An inevitable sensation of excitement builds as you approach the great monolith. If you drive toward it in a rental car, you may find yourself gasping at the first glimpse of it through the windshield; if you\'re on a tour bus, you\'ll likely want to grab the person sitting next to you and point out the window as it looms larger and larger. Rising like an enormous red mountain in the middle of an otherwise completely flat desert, Uluru really is a marvel to behold.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Uluru-Kata Tjuta Cultural Centre</b> (Off Lasseter Hwy.tel. 08/8956-1128) is the first thing you\'ll see after entering the park through a tollgate. The two buildings are built in a serpentine style, reflecting the Kuniya and Liru stories about two ancestral snakes who fought a long-ago battle on the southern side of Uluru. Inside, you can learn about Aboriginal history, and the return of the park to Aboriginal ownership in 1983. There\'s also an excellent park\'s ranger station where you can get maps and hiking guides, as well as an art shop, and a pottery store with lovely collectibles. As you work your way around Uluru, your perspective of the great rock changes significantly. You should allow four hours to walk the 10 km (6 mi) around the rock and explore the several deep crevices along the way; you can also drive around it on the paved road. Be aware that some places are Aboriginal sacred sites and cannot be entered, nor can they be photographed. These are clearly signposted. Aboriginal art can be found in caves at the rock\'s base. If you\'re looking for an easy walk that takes you just partway around the base, the <b>Mala Walk</b> is 2 km (1 mi) in length and almost all on flat land. The walk goes to the Kanju Gorge from the base of the climbing trail; park rangers provide free tours daily at 8 AM from October to April and at 10 AM from May to September.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There\'s only one trail that leads to the top of the rock. Though many people visit Uluru with the explicit intention of climbing it, there are a few things you should bear in mind before attempting this. First, Aboriginal people consider climbing the rock to be sacrilege—so if you believe in preserving the sanctity of sacred native sites, you may have to be content with admiring it from below. Your entry pass into the park even says,\"It is requested that you respect the wishes of the Anangu by not climbing Uluru.\" Second, if you do decide to make the climb, be aware that it\'s a very strenuous hike, and not suitable for those who aren\'t physically fit. The ascent is about 1½ km (1 mi), and the round-trip climb takes about three hours. Sturdy hiking boots, a hat, sunscreen, and drinking water are absolute necessities (no food or water available at the summit). The climb is closed when temperatures rise above 36°C (97°F)—which means after 9 AM most mornings in the summertime. Tour buses that bring groups to climb the rock often arrive at the site as early as 4:30 AM for this reason. Remember that regardless of the season, travelers are advised to drink a quart of water for every hour that they are walking around the national park.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Another popular way to experience Uluru is far less taxing but no less intense: watching the natural light reflect on it from one of the two sunset-viewing areas. As the last rays of daylight strike, the rock positively glows, as if lighted from within.

It should also be noted that many restaurants choose Monday as their day of rest. Lunches are usually served between noon and 2 PM, but many restaurants in Amsterdam are open for dinner only.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dress</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Because Amsterdam is a casual sort of town,\"jacket and tie\" means more \"if you feel like it\" than \"required.\" The truly elitist dining spots have long learned to have a supply of jackets on hand for the underdressed. So,\"jacket\" yes, possibly, though \"jacket and tie\" is a true rarity.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Smoking</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although there are strict anti-public smoking laws on the horizon, the cafés and restaurants of Amsterdam remain puffing paradises. Most restaurants provide no-smoking sections, but the fervently pink-lunged antismoker should really call ahead to get the full scoop.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Tipping</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A 15% service charge is automatically included on the menu prices. However, the trend is for most diners to throw in an extra euro or two on smaller bills and EUR 5 or EUR 10 on larger bills.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Amsterdam\'s Historic Almshouses</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hidden behind innocent-looking gateways throughout the city center, most notably along the main ring of canals and in the Jordaan neighborhood, are some of Amsterdam\'s most charming houses. There are about 30 <i>hofjes</i> (little courtyards surrounded by almshouses), mainly dating back to the 18th century when the city\'s flourishing merchants established hospices for the old and needy. Their philanthropy was supposed to be rewarded by a place in heaven. But be warned (and be prepared for disappointment): today\'s residents of these hofjes like their peace and quiet, and often lock their entrances to keep out visitors.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Begijnhof</b>. Here, serenity reigns just feet away from the bustle of the city. The Begijnhof is the tree-filled courtyard of a residential hideaway, built in the 14th century for the Begijntes, a lay Catholic sisterhood. Created as conventlike living quarters for unmarried or widowed laywomen—of which there were many since most able-bodied men were shipped off and killed in the Crusades—this almshouse required them to follow three simple rules: no hens, no dogs, no men. Rent was paid in the form of caring for the sick and educating the destitute. One resident loved living in the Begijnhof so much that she asked to be buried in the gutter here in 1654—so out of respect, don\'t tap-dance on the slab of red granite on the walkway on the left side of De Engelse Kerk.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">No. 34 is the oldest house in Amsterdam and one of only two remaining wooden houses in the city center (horrific fires forced the city to outlaw the construction of wooden buildings in the 15th century). The small <b>Engelse Kerk</b> (English Church) across from No. 48 dates from 1400. Its pulpit panels were designed by a young and broke Piet Mondriaan. After the Calvinst coup (the Altercation of 1578) the church was confiscated from the Beguines, who later built the supposedly clandestine <b>Mirakel-</b> or <b>Begijnhof-Kapel</b> (Miracle- or Begijn-Chapel), across the lane at No. 29. Entrances on the north side of Spui and on Gedempte Begijnensloot opposite Begijnensteeg, Centrum. OPEN: Mirakel- or Begijnhof-Kapel Mon. 1-6:30, Tues.-Fri. 9-6:30, weekends 9-6.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Begijnhof is by far the most famous hofje, but there are a few other little gems that you could explore in a day. The <b>Sint Andrieshofje</b> (Egelantiersgracht 105-141, Jordaan), founded in 1614, is the second-oldest almshouse in Amsterdam. Take notice of the fine gables, including a step gable in the style of Hendrick de Keyser.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Claes Claeszhofje</b> (Junction of Egelantiersstraat 28-54, Eerste Egelantiersdwarsstraat 1-5, and Tuinstraat 35-49, Jordaan) was founded in 1616 by the textile dealer Claes Claesz Anslo (note his coat of arms atop one entry). The houses here were renovated and are now rented out to artists, the happiest of whom must occupy the <b>Huis met de Schrijvende Hand</b> (\"House with the Writing Hand\"), the oldest and most picturesque of the lot, topped by a six-stepped gable.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Zevenkeurvorstenhofje</b> (Tuinstraat 197-223) was founded around 1645, though the houses standing today are from the 18th century, and the <b>Karthuizerhof</b> (Karthuizerstraat 21-131, Jordaan) was founded in 1650 and has a courtyard with two 17th-century pumps.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the Prinsengracht, between the Prinsenstraat and the Brouwersgracht, are two hofjes right close to one another. The <b>Van Brienen</b> (Prinsengracht 85-133, closed to the public) and <b>De Zon</b> (Prinsengracht 159-171, open weekdays 10-5) both have plaques telling their stories.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For a moment of peace, visit the <b>Suykerhoff-hofje</b> and take in its abundantly green courtyard. These houses opened their doors in 1670 to Protestant \"daughters and widows\" (as long as they behaved and exhibited \"a peace-loving humor\") and provided each of them with free rent, 20 tons of turf, 10 pounds of rice, a vat of butter, and some spending money each year. If only the same was done today. Lindengracht 149-163, Centrum.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Of particular note are the houses at Nos. 188 to 194. The canal is blessed with long views down the main canals and plenty of sunlight, perfect for photo-ops. Also, The Brouwersgracht runs westward from the end of the Singel (a short walk along Prins Hendrikkade from Centraal Station) and forms a cap to the western end of the Grachtengordel. On top of the old canal mansions dotting the Brouwersgracht are symbols referring to the old breweries that used this waterway to transport their goods to thirsty drinks hundreds of years ago. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Amsterdams Historisch Museum</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Any city that began in the 13th century as a sinking bog to eventually become the 17th century\'s most powerful trading city has a fascinating story to tell, and this museum does it superbly. It\'s housed in a rambling amalgamation of buildings, which was used as an orphanage in 1580 and then reopened as a museum in 1975. On the ground level are the old Boys\' and Girls\' Courtyards, separated by a loggia. In the boys\' section, now the terrace of the <b>David &amp; Goliath Café,</b> are rows of wooden lockers once used by the orphans but now adorned with photos and artwork depicting Amsterdam\'s cultural life.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Exiting the opposite end will lead you toward <b>Schutters Gallery.</b> This atrium—which used to be a narrow canal that separated the boy orphans from the girl orphans—is filled with huge, historic portraits of city militias. As portrait art in the 1600s was a symbol of wealth, power and most importantly, bragging rights, the militia companies sure seemed to like to brag. These paintings, which are free to see, are impressive. Pride of place here is given to works by Dirck Barendsz and Cornelis Anthonisz, notably the latter\'s <i>Meal of the 17 Guardsmen of Company H.</i> Elsewhere, be sure to take in the grand Regents\' Chamber, adorned with a magnificent 1656 ceiling painting. Also notable are the paintings of the great Golden Age, along with 17th-century city maps and dour Burgomeister, or mayoral portraits, and a stirring photographic collage that captures the triumphs and tragedies of the modern-day metropolis. www.ahm.nl. COST: EUR 7. OPEN: Weekdays 10-5, weekends 11-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museum het Rembrandthuis</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of Amsterdam\'s more remarkable relics, this house was bought by Rembrandt, flush with success, for his family and is where he lived and worked between 1639 and 1658. Rembrandt chose this house on what was once the main street of the Jewish Quarter because he thought he could then experience daily and firsthand the faces he would use in his Old Testament religious paintings. Later Rembrandt lost the house to bankruptcy when he fell from popularity after the death of Saskia, his wife. When he showed a quick recovery—and an open taste for servant girls—after her death, his uncle-in-law, once his greatest champion, became his biggest detractor. Rembrandt\'s downfall was sealed: he came under attack by the Amsterdam burghers, who refused to accept his liaison with his amour, Hendrickje.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The house interior has been restored to its original form—complete with one of Rembrandt\'s printing presses, his rarities collection, and fully stocked studio (which is occasionally used by guest artists). The new gallery wing, complete with shop, café, and information center, is the only place in the world where his graphic work is on permanent display—with 250 of the 290 prints that are known to have come from his hand, including the magisterial <i>Hundred Guilder</i> and the <i>Three Crosses</i> prints. Rembrandt was almost more revolutionary in his prints than in his paintings, so this collection deserves respectful homage, if not downright devotion, by printmakers today. www.rembrandthuis.nl. COST: EUR 8. OPEN: Daily 10-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Anne Frankhuis</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Anne Frank is by far one of the most famous authors of the 20th century, testimony to the inspiring story of a girl who died at age 15 in a tragic end of the two-year saga. In the pages of <i>The Diary of Anne Frank</i> (published in 1947 as <i>The Annex</i> by her father after her death) the young Anne kept her sad record of two increasingly fraught years living in secret confinement from the Nazis. Along with the van Daan family, the Frank family felt the noose tighten, and so decided to move into a hidden warren of rooms at the back of this 1635-built canal house.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Anne Frank was born in Germany in 1929; when she was four her family moved to the Netherlands to escape growing anti-Jewish sentiment. Otto Frank operated a pectin business and decided to stay in his adopted country when the war finally reached the Netherlands in 1940. In July 1942, the five adults and three children sought refuge in the attic of the annex \"backhouse,\" or <i>achterhuis,</i> of Otto\'s business in the center of Amsterdam, in a hidden warren of rooms screened behind a hinged bookcase. Here, as one of many <i>onderduikers</i> (\"people in hiding\") throughout all of Amsterdam, Anne dreamed her dreams, wrote her diary, and pinned up movie-star pictures to her wall (still on view). The van Pelsen family, including their son, Peter (van Daan in Anne\'s journal), along with the dentist Fritz Pfeffer (Dussel) joined them in their cramped quarters. Four trusted employees provided them with food and supplies. In her diary, Anne chronicles the day-to-day life in the house: her longing for a best friend, her crush on Peter, her frustration with her mother, her love for her father, and her annoyance with the petty dentist, Dussel. In August 1944, the Franks were betrayed and the Gestapo invaded their hideaway. All the members of the annex were transported to camps, where Anne and her sister, Margot, died of typhoid fever in Bergen Belsen a few months before the liberation. Otto Frank was the only survivor of the annex. Miep Gies, one of the friends who helped with the hiding, found Anne\'s diary after the raid and kept it through the war. Now, millions of children read it and its tale of humanity\'s struggle with fascism. www.annefrank.nl. COST: EUR 7.50.

It is one of Amsterdam\'s prettiest bridges, and offers a gorgeous view of the Amstel and surrounding area. The Magere Brug was purportedly built in 1672 by two sisters living on opposite sides of the Amstel, who wanted an efficient way of sharing that grandest of Dutch traditions: the <i>gezellig</i> (socially cozy) midmorning coffee break. Walk by at night when it\'s spectacularly lighted, and often drawn up to let boats pass by. Many replacements to the original bridge have come and gone, and this, dating from 1969, is just the latest. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rijksmuseum Vincent Van Gogh</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Opened in 1973, this remarkable, light-infused building, based on a design by famed De Stijl architect Gerrit Rietveld, venerates the short, certainly not sweet, but highly productive career of everyone\'s favorite tortured 19th-century artist. First things first: Vincent was a Dutch boy, so his name is not pronounced like the \"Go\" in Go-Go Lounge but rather like the \"Go\" uttered when one is choking on a whole raw herring. Although some of the Van Gogh paintings scattered throughout the world\'s high-art temples are of dubious provenance, this collection\'s authenticity is indisputable: its roots trace directly back to brother Theo van Gogh, Vincent\'s artistic and financial supporter. The 200 paintings and 500 drawings on display here begin in 1880, when Van Gogh was 27 and end in 1890, when he took his own life. The <i>Potato Eaters,</i> the series of <i>Sunflowers</i> and landscapes such as <i>Irises</i> and <i>Wheatfield with a Reaper,</i> are some of Van Gogh\'s most famous pieces. A bonus of the Van Gogh Museum is that it holds temporary exhibits of other important 19th-century artists and collections of art, graphic design, photography, and sculpture related to Van Gogh\'s development as a painter. A modern oval extension, opened in 1999, connects the main galleries by an underground walkway. The museum\'s café and shop are worth taking the time to enjoy. www.vangoghmuseum.nl. COST: EUR 10. OPEN: Sat.-Thurs. 10-6, Fri. 10-10. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nederlands Theatermuseum</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Amsterdam has dozens of Golden Age house museums, but few are as gilded as this one. Currently home to part of the Theater Instituut Nederland (Netherlands Theater Institute), the <b>Bartolotti Huis</b> (Nos. 170-172) is made up of two spectacular examples of Hendrick de Keyser\'s work. The rest of the museum takes up the equally delectable White House (No. 168), built in 1638. Its original owner, Michiel Pauw—as one of the initiators of the West India Company—could easily afford its interior of marble-lined corridors, sweeping monumental staircases, densely rendered plasterwork, and ceiling paintings by Jacob de Wit. All of these attributes have been restored and provide a lush backdrop for exhibitions about the history of theater in all its forms: circus, opera, musical, puppetry, and drama. There are costumes, models of stage sets, and an extensive library with archives focused on the theatrical scene in the Netherlands. Its stellar back garden—alone worth the price—is the perfect place to sip a coffee from the café while imagining it as the setting for Baroque-era barbecues. www.tin.nl. COST: EUR 4.50.

The best waves are usually at San Clemente, Newport Beach, and Huntington Beach. From June through September the ocean temperature tops 70°F and lifeguards patrol almost every beach. Local newspapers print beach reports with wave information and notice of any closures.

After breakfast at a downtown eatery, a walk along the <b>Tony Knowles Coastal Trail</b> provides views of the inlet, Mt. Susitna, and the Alaska Range. Afterward, check out some shops and galleries, historic sites, museums, and parks downtown. By car, visit the <b>Alaska Aviation Heritage Museum</b> and the <b>Alaska Native Heritage Center.</b></div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Follow the one-day itinerary, then head down the Seward Highway for views of <b>Potter Marsh</b> and Turnagain Arm. Keep an eye out for Dall sheep along the cliffs and beluga whales in Turnagain Arm. Continue farther down the highway to Alyeska Resort at Girdwood and ride the tram 2,300 feet up the mountain for lunch with a spectacular alpine view. Next, continue south to Portage Glacier and the Begich-Boggs Visitor Center for educational displays and lectures on area glaciers. Back in Anchorage on Day 3, take in a baseball game at Mulcahy Stadium or get a bird\'s-eye view of the city with a hike into the Chugach Mountains.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Uniquely Alaska</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Alaska has more than its share of odd and unexpected attractions, including the handful of offbeat destinations described below. This is just a sampling; see elsewhere in this book for infamous bars (such as the Red Dog Saloon in Juneau and the Salty Dawg Saloon in Homer) and Alaskan thrills, including the world-famous 1,100-mile-long Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hammers in Haines</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Alaska\'s most peculiar museum is owned by Dave Pahl, whose collection of more than 1,400 hammers is on display in the crowded little <b>Hammer Museum</b> (108 Main St., Haines. tel. 907/766-2374. www.hammermuseum.org) in downtown Haines.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Last Train to Nowhere, Nome</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Among Alaska\'s most interesting Bush settlements, Nome was founded following a major gold discovery in 1898, and is still home to summertime gold-dredging operations. During the gold rush, the Council City and Solomon River Railroad envisioned a rail system connecting Nome with the Lower 48—thousands of miles away. Construction only reached 35 mi before storms destroyed the tracks along the Bering Sea in 1907, and the project was abandoned. The company went under, but visitors marvel at the engines and several railcars rusting away on the tundra south of Nome.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">North Pole, Alaska</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The world\'s tallest St. Nick (40 feet in all his wooden splendor) welcomes you to <b>Santa Claus House</b> (101 St. Nicholas Dr., North Pole. tel. 907/488-2200) in the town of North Pole just southeast of Fairbanks. Inside this large red-and-white store, kids can sit on Santa\'s lap any time of the year, while parents shop for all sorts of Christmas paraphernalia, from ornaments and musical CDs to certificates that grant you one square inch of land in the Santa Claus subdivision of North Pole. The town was started by Con Miller, who built a trading post here in the 1950s. He and his neighbors incorporated the new town as North Pole.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Surfing in Southeast</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The remote town of Yakutat lies along the Gulf of Alaska halfway between Juneau and Cordova. It isn\'t a major tourist destination, but it does have the state\'s longest beach, a 70-mi stretch that starts just outside town. It\'s never crowded, but local surfers and beach bums ride the swells that roll off the Gulf of Alaska throughout the year. There\'s even a surf shop, aptly named Icy Waves.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

In winter, cross-country skiers take to it by storm. The trail begins off 2nd Avenue, west of Christensen Drive, and curls along Cook Inlet for approximately 11 mi to Kincaid Park, beyond the airport. In summer you might spot beluga whales offshore in Cook Inlet. Access points are on the waterfront at the ends of 2nd, 5th, and 9th avenues and at Westchester Lagoon. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Alaska Native Heritage Center</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On a 26-acre site facing the Chugach Mountains, this facility provides an introduction to Alaska\'s native peoples. The spacious Welcome House has interpretive displays, artifacts, photographs, demonstrations, native dances, storytelling and films, along with a café and gift shop. Step outside for a stroll around the adjacent lake, where you will pass five village exhibits representing native cultural groups through traditional structures and exhibitions. The Heritage Center provides a free shuttle from the downtown Log Cabin Visitor Information Center several times a day in summer. You can also hop a bus at the downtown transit center; Route 4 will take you to the Heritage Center front door. www.alaskanative.net. COST: $24.95, $10 Alaska residents.

Remember that most sights close promptly at 5 PM and that some ruins are closed on Sunday and Monday.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">1. <b>Attend mass.</b> History and religion interlock in Antigua like nowhere else.

Even if you aren\'t Catholic, this is Antigua at its most devout, and well worth a look.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">2. <b>Pay homage to Brother Pedro.</b> Pedro de San José Betancur, Guatemala\'s very own saint, is said to intercede on behalf of the faithful who pray at his tomb in the San Francisco Monastery, although we can\'t guarantee your request will be answered.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">3. <b>Take a horse-drawn carriage ride.</b> It\'s a wonderful way to see the city by day.

If you want a tour in your own language, bring along your own guide.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">4. <b>Jockey for the perfect photo position.</b> The Santa Catalina arch is the symbol of the city; and standing in front of it is the <i>de rigueur</i> photo. Your best chance of getting a clear shot is on Sunday, when Avenida 5 Norte, the street running under the arch, is closed to traffic.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">5. <b>Listen to the marimbas.</b> Music from the buzzing, xylophone-like marimba wafts from restaurants and hotel gardens, or out on the street as small ensembles spontaneously set up shop. Don\'t forget to leave a coin in their collection bowls for the entertainment.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">6. <b>Scope out a bench in the Parque Central.</b> Antigua\'s tree-shaded central park is <i>the</i> people-watching venue in the city. You may have to circle benches like a vulture on Sunday when everybody else has the same idea.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">7. <b>Get a shoe shine.</b> Locals pay Q5 to have their shoes polished to a brilliant shine. You\'ll likely be asked double that, but don\'t quibble over price with the kids who approach you in the central park. (They speak little English, but they do know the words \"Shoe shine?\") It\'s still a bargain and your shoes will look like new again.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the topic of shoes, flimsy soles mean you\'ll feel every cobblestone press through the bottoms of your feet. Wear something sturdy and comfortable.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Something Old, Something New</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Antigua\'s colonial magnificence disappeared in one day in 1773 following a massive earthquake. With the move of the capital to nearby Guatemala City, there was no need (and no money) to restore Antigua\'s treasures. Urban legend holds that the city was totally leveled and completely abandoned following the earthquake; neither is true, but nearly two centuries of stagnation did follow.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Things changed in the 1960s with a newfound interest among residents in preserving and restoring that former glory once again. The Guatemalan government had declared Antigua a national monument in 1944, a title largely ceremonial, but the Protective Law for the City of La Antigua Guatemala, enacted by the national government in 1969, would change the fortunes of the city forever.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Key to those newfound fortunes was the formation of an active Consejo Nacional para la Protección de La Antigua Guatemala (National Council for the Protection of Antigua Guatemala), whose efforts have focused on the rescue and restoration of some 50 monuments. That work comes at a price—money is scarce in Guatemala—but the governments of Spain, Japan, and Taiwan have chipped in to fund several projects. Guatemalan corporate sponsors—including cement manufacturer Cementos Progreso, Pepsi, chicken restaurant chain Pollo Campero, and national telephone company Telgua—have made generous donations, as well.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In a more general sense, beyond specific projects, the council actively spearheaded the elimination of street advertising from businesses. Walk down any Antigua street and you\'ll notice that signs are conspicuously and pleasantly discreet. Next on the council\'s wish list—it\'s a long shot to be sure—is the elimination of vehicular traffic from select downtown streets. You can get a taste of this on Sunday, when Avenida 5 Norte, the street passing under the Santa Catalina arch, is closed to traffic.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">An influx of visitors from around the world has nevertheless been an end result, but the restoration projects have always been undertaken as a matter of civic pride and not to create a vast outdoor museum.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Current and recent council projects include:</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de La Merced:</b> reinforcement of arcades in cloister and restoration of <i>Jesús Nazareno</i> figure.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Iglesia de San Cristóbal El Bajo:</b> structural reinforcement of damage from 1976 earthquake.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Iglesia de San Juan El Obispo:</b> restoration of church bell.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Iglesia de Santa Inés:</b> restoration of façade, remodeling of atrium, and exterior illumination.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Palacio de los Capitanes Generales:</b> reinforcement of roof tiles and rotted wood.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Rescate del Color Antigüeño (\"rescue of Antigua color\"):</b> ongoing campaign to repaint buildings in their original colors; most activity on 1 Avenida Norte, 2 Avenida Sur, 7 Avenida Norte, and 3 Calle Oriente.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>San José Catedral:</b> restoration of figures on cathedral facade damaged in 1976 earthquake.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Weaving Culture, Weaving History</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It is said that the Mayan goddess Ixchel gave the art of weaving to her people. Today\'s Mayan descendents still make fervent use of that gift in generating the riot of bold, cultural color that punctuates the muted green and brown natural tones of the highlands.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Key to the taut weave of Guatemalan textiles is the back-strap loom, a technique peculiar to this part of the world. Characteristics always identify the wearer with a specific town, a salient feature of indigenous Guatemalan clothing. Although today\'s Mayan-descended peoples proudly wear their attire as a badge of where they live, the structure actually began as a dress code implemented by Spanish colonial officials. They wanted to be able to identify their subjects by community of origin for tax-collection purposes. The system took on a far darker side during Guatemala\'s civil war when the government used clothing to identify and target specific indigenous communities.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A brief visit to the highlands will let you scratch the surface in identifying community differences: you\'ll begin to recognize the bright turquoises and bold geometric patterns of Santa Catarina Palopó; the tight embroidery of Nebaj, the showy, embroidered flowers and birds of Santiago Atitlán, or the knot tie-dyes of Salcajá.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A bit of vocabulary: a <i>huipil,</i> sometimes spelled <i>guipil,</i> refers to a woman\'s blouse. Structurally, it is little more than two pieces of cloth sewn together, but what a huipil lacks in tailoring, it more than makes up for in elaborate design. Equally simple in fit is her <i>corte,</i> a wraparound skirt, also woven with complex patterns. In some communities, women wear a <i>tocoyal,</i> a piece of cloth wrapped tightly and worn as a circular headdress. (Alternately, this headgear is called a <i>cinta,</i> but foreigners often refer to it simply as a \"halo.\") What about traditional menswear? You won\'t see much of that, period—you\'ll come to that realization after a short time in the highlands—except in a few isolated communities such as Todos Santos Cuchumatán, where men still don a traditional woven shirt (<i>camisa</i>) and knee-length trousers (<i>calzoncillos</i>). Those trousers may be convered by an apron-like <i>sobrepantalón,</i> and a belt or sash (<i>faja</i>) might accent the ensemble.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The market for Guatemalan textiles has grown by leaps and bounds, and many villages have benefited, but, alas, many of the finer points of the weaving tradition are being left by the wayside to accommodate the frenzied shoppers. The traditional back-strap looms are speedily being replaced with gleaming sewing machines so garments can be churned out faster. The patterns that once relayed information about the wearer\'s town are now abandoned for those favored by visitors. Even those garments not destined for the tourist market have undergone change. The explosion of vendors selling <i>ropa americana</i>—literally \"American clothing,\" but a generic term referring to secondhand clothes—means that a pair of jeans or a sweater can be had for a fraction of the cost (and time) it takes to produce a huipil and corte.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The giant would collect a toll from boatmen on the river and cut off the hands of those who refused, until Silvius confronted him, cut off the giant\'s own hand, and flung it into the river Scheldt. That\'s why there are severed hands on Antwerp\'s coat of arms.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Great prosperity came to Antwerp during the reign of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Born in Gent and raised in Mechelen, he made Antwerp the principal port of his vast domain. It became Europe\'s most important commercial center in the 16th century, as well as a center of the new craft of printing. The Golden Age came to an end with the abdication of Charles V in 1555. He was succeeded by Philip II of Spain, whose ardent Roman Catholicism brought him into immediate conflict with the Protestants of the Netherlands. In 1566, when Calvinist iconoclasts destroyed paintings and sculptures in churches and monasteries, Philip II responded by sending in Spanish troops. In what became known as the Spanish Fury, they sacked the town and killed thousands of citizens.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The decline of Antwerp had already begun when its most illustrious painters, Peter Paul Rubens, Jacob Jordaens, and Anthony Van Dyck, reached the peak of their fame. Rubens\'s tie to the city is a genial, pervasive presence. The artist\'s house, his church, and the homes of his benefactors, friends, and disciples are all over the old city. His wife also seems to be everywhere, for she frequently posed as the model for his portraits of the Virgin Mary. Rubens and fellow Antwerper Van Dyck both dabbled in diplomacy and were knighted by the English monarch. Jordaens, less widely known, stayed close to Antwerp all his life.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Treaty of Munster in 1648, which concluded the Thirty Years\' War, further weakened Antwerp\'s position, for the river Scheldt was closed to shipping—it was not to be active again until 1863, when a treaty obliged the Dutch, who controlled the estuary, to reopen it.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The huge and splendid railway station, built at the close of the 19th century, remains a fitting monument to Antwerp\'s second age of prosperity, during which it hosted universal expositions in 1885 and 1894. In World War I, Antwerp held off German invaders long enough for the Belgian army to regroup south of the IJzer. In World War II, the Germans trained many V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets on the city, where Allied troops were debarking for the final push.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Architecture of Antwerp</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The architectural character of Antwerp was defined during its two great eras of prosperity, in the 16th and 19th centuries. The relative lack of building at other times means that the city is unusually harmonious, with four- and five-story brick buildings mostly undisturbed by skyscrapers and steel-and-glass cubes. Traditional Flemish Gothic architecture pervades Antwerp, from its impressive Grote Markt to the many small, unsung buildings that line the narrow streets of the old town. The style continued to influence construction in the 19th century, but that period also brought the richly ornamented buildings that line Antwerp\'s main shopping street, as well as the fanciful extravaganzas of the Antwerp zoo. The combination makes a walk through Antwerp an aesthetic delight.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Antwerp\'s Local Dining Traditions</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Belgium\'s kinship to brewing figures high in the country\'s culture and regional differences give way to local flavors. Antwerp has its own brewery, De Koninck (The King), and its light-amber beer is drunk in a special 8 oz. glass. Some prefer the beer in a smaller glass called a <i>prinske</i> (prince).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the past, every household had a bottle of <i>Elixir d\'Anvers</i> in its medicine cabinet, a homemade remedy respected for its healing properties. Touted as strong enough to cure a horse, its use was endorsed by Louis Pasteur. It consists of 32 different kinds of herbs; saffron gives it a yellow color. Nowadays, it\'s simply a popular aperitif.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><i>Worstenbrood</i> (sausage in bread) is typically eaten the Monday following January 6th. Tradition dictated that corporations and guilds hold annual meetings at the beginning of the year, after which people didn\'t return to work, leading to <i>verloren maandag</i> (Lost Monday). The butcher offered employees sausages and the baker, bread—hence, worstenbrood was born. Over time, it became a ritual among laborers.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Turning to the more exotic, <i>paling in \'t groen</i> (eel in green sauce) is cooked in a special sauce with an assortment of herbs. <i>Fricadellen met krieken</i> (meatloaf smothered with sour cherries and a lot of sugar) is popular during holidays or feasts.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Often referred to in English as \"Mad Meg,\" it portrays an irate woman wearing helmet and breastplate—a sword in one hand, and food and cooking utensils in the other—striding across a field strewn with the ravages and insanity of war. There is no consensus on how to read this painting. Some consider it one of the most powerful antiwar statements ever made. Others claim that it denounces the Inquisition. Either way, nothing could be further from the Bruegelian villages than this nightmare world. In 1894, Mayer Van den Bergh bought <i>Dulle Griet</i> for 480 Belgian francs. Today it is priceless. The museum also has a set of Bruegel\'s witty, miniature illustrations of <i>Twelve Proverbs,</i> based on popular Flemish sayings.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mayer Van den Bergh was a passionate art connoisseur who amassed a private collection of almost 4,000 works in the 19th century. The collection includes treasures such as a life-size polychrome statue from about 1300 of St. John resting his head on Christ\'s chest (room 6). It is, however, the Bruegels that make this small museum a must. There\'s an English-language pamphlet on sale for EUR 2.50 that reviews part of the collection. museum.antwerpen.be/mayervandenbergh.

Work began in 1352 and continued in fits and starts until 1521. Despite this, it is a homogeneous monument, thanks to a succession of remarkable architects, including Peter Appelmans, Herman and Domien de Waghemakere, and Rombout Keldermans the Younger. The tower holds a 49-bell carillon played at various times throughout the year.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The cathedral\'s art treasures were twice vandalized, first by Calvinists in 1566 and again by the French revolutionary army at the end of the 18th century. The French even broke up the floor so that their horses would not slip on it. The masterpieces were either sold at auction or carried off to Paris. Some, but by no means all, have subsequently been returned. Other works, either donated or purchased, make up an outstanding collection of 17th-century religious art, including four Rubens altarpieces, glowing with his marvelous red, allegedly fortified by pigeon\'s blood. The panels of <i>De Kruisafneming</i> (<i>The Descent from the Cross</i>) triptych—Mary\'s visit to Elizabeth (with the painter\'s wife as Mary) and the presentation of Jesus in the temple—are among the most delicate and tender biblical scenes ever painted. <i>De Hemelvaart van de Maagd Maria</i> (<i>The Assumption of the Virgin Mary</i>), painted for the high altar, shows the Virgin being carried upward by massed ranks of cherubs toward the angel waiting to crown her Queen of the Angels. <i>De Hemelvaart</i> (<i>The Assumption</i>) is skillfully displayed so that the rays of the sun illuminate it exactly at noon. www.dekathedraal.be.

But don\'t let the surreal flash keep you from enjoying the warmth and sincerity of the town; for all the glitz, Aspen is still full of fascinating and friendly locals.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Historic Hotels:</b> Along with such luxurious properties as the St. Regis Resort in Aspen and the hip Sky Hotel, there are plenty of other, more-sentimental lodging choices in the valley. Thanks to moneyed preservationists the Roaring Fork Valley is home to several of Colorado\'s finest historic hotels including the Victorian Hotel Jerome in Aspen, the Medici-inspired Hotel Colorado in Glenwood Springs, and the elegant Redstone Inn in Redstone.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The Maroon Bells:</b> If you\'re looking for postcard Colorado, you\'ll find it in the 14,000-foot Maroon Bell peaks. Visit on a quiet autumn morning when the aspen are turning and the steep-faced pyramid peaks reflect a dusting of snow in Maroon Lake, and don\'t be surprised if you hum a John Denver tune.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Fine Fare:</b> From Matsuhisa sushi to lobster strudel, Aspen, Carbondale, and Glenwood Springs have just about any dish you can imagine due to the world-class chefs drawn to the region\'s blizzard of tourist dollars. It\'s possible to dine like a king (and pay a king\'s ransom), but there are also tasty and affordable options to be found.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Hot Springs:</b> You\'ll find modern spas galore in Aspen, but the authentic and natural treat can be found down valley at Glenwood Springs where the 90°F mineral-water pool has been a therapeutic retreat since the Ute Indians knew it as <i>Yampah</i> or \"healing waters.\"</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rafting the Roaring Fork Valley</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The key to understanding white-water rafting is the rating system. Rivers are rated from Class I (small waves where you really don\'t need to paddle to avoid anything) to Class VI (almost impossible to run, a mistake can be fatal). To confuse matters, rivers change classes depending on how fast they are flowing (measured in cubic feet of water per second). May and June are peak rafting seasons for those who want the adrenaline rush of fighting spring runoff. By mid-August many rivers are little more than lazy float trips.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Roaring Fork, a free-flowing river (no dams), is regularly considered a Class III. Because it runs away from major highways through the heart of ranch country, you\'re liable to see more wildlife than on the Colorado; in June your guides may point out a nest full of croaking bald eaglets. Cemetery Rapids, a half-mile churning stretch of white water, is the most exciting run.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The stretch of the mighty Colorado that runs through the steep, spectacular walls of Glenwood Canyon alongside I-70 is divided into two sections: the rough and tumble Shoshone below the dam, and the wider, mellower regions beyond. During the peak runoff season, the Shoshone is considered a Class IV river with aptly named rapids like Maneater and Baptism. The lower Colorado still has some exciting stretches, including Maintenance Shack, a Class III rapid that can flip a large raft. By July and August, you can hit the same rapid sideways or backward and barely get wet. The lower stretches of the Colorado pass by several hidden, and not-so-hidden, shallow hot springs. If you\'d like to warm up in them, ask your guides.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Aspen\'s Saturday Market</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Get a taste of daily life in Aspen every Saturday from mid-June though late October at the Aspen Saturday Market on Hopkins Avenue next to City Hall. This is an arts fair masquerading as a farmers\' market, but the real fun is the people-watching. Women in $1,200 designer jeans chat on cell phones beneath rumpled cowboy hats, off-duty waiters stroll muddy mountain bikes past, and the vendors and artists hope to mine the new Aspen wealth. You can buy ceramic plates, mugs, and serving dishes from a number of local potters—be sure to take a look at Alleghany Meadows—some of whom also supply flatware to local restaurants.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For beautiful rings and dangling earrings, try Cathleen Crenshaw or Harmony Scott. There\'s even a blacksmith, Stephen Bershenyi, who crafts delicate flowers out of iron. Hungry? Don\'t forget the food vendors, including Jack Rabbit Hill Winery, Cloud Nine Brownie, and the Haystack Goat Dairy.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Cars are allowed only partway, but the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority provides shuttle buses that leave regularly in summer months from the Rubey Park Transportation Center in downtown Aspen.

In three days you can explore some key neighborhoods as well as monuments from the classical, Roman, and Byzantine periods; add two more days and you can take in some of the prettier suburbs, head to the beach, or check out new galleries.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 1 Day</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Early in the morning, pay homage to Athens\'s most impressive monument, the Acropolis. Then descend through Anafiotika, the closest thing you\'ll find to an island village on the mainland. Explore the 19th-century quarter of Plaka, with its neoclassical houses, and stop for lunch at one of its many tavernas. Do a little bargaining with the merchants in the old Turkish bazaar around Monastiraki Square. Spend a couple of hours in the afternoon taking in the stunning collection of antiquities in the National Archaeological Museum (check to be sure it\'s open); then pass by Syntagma Square to watch the changing of the costumed Evzone guards in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. You can then window-shop or people-watch in the tony neighborhood of Kolonaki. Nearby, take the funicular up to Mt. Lycabettus for the sunset before enjoying a show at the Odeon of Herod Atticus, followed by dinner in the funky district of Psirri.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After a morning tour of the Acropolis, stop at the Acropolis Museum to view sculptures found on the site (note that the museum is in the process of moving to a new location below the Acropolis). Continue through Anafiotika and Plaka, making sure to stop at the Greek Folk Art Museum, the Roman Agora, and the Little Mitropolis church on the outskirts of the quarter. After a late lunch, detour to Hadrian\'s Arch and the Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens\'s most important Roman monuments. In Syntagma Square, watch the changing of the Evzone guards, and then head to Kolonaki, followed by an ouzo on the slopes of Mt. Lycabettus at I Prasini Tenta, with its panorama of the Acropolis and the sea. Dine in a local taverna (Karavitis and Aphrodite are good choices), perhaps near the Panathenaic Stadium—in Pangrati, the National Gardens, or around the Temple of Zeus—which is lighted at night.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On Day 2, visit the cradle of democracy, the ancient Agora, site of Greece\'s best-preserved Doric temple, the Hephaistion. Explore the Monastiraki area, including the tiny Byzantine Kapnikarea Church, which stands in the middle of the street. In Monastiraki you can snack on the city\'s best souvlaki, then hop the metro to Piraeus to explore its neighborhoods and feast on fish in Mikrolimano harbor.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the third day, start early for the National Archaeological Museum, breaking for lunch in one of the city\'s mezedopoleia. Swing through the city center, past the Old University complex, a vestige of King Otho\'s reign, to the Goulandris Cycladic and Greek Ancient Art Museum in Kolonaki or the more recent artifacts in the Benaki Museum down the street. Stroll through the National Garden. Complete the evening with ballet or pop music at the Odeon of Herod Atticus, a movie at a <i>therina</i> (open-air cinema), or, in winter, a concert at the Megaron Musikis/Athens Concert Hall.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 5 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend your first three days as detailed above. On the fourth, see the Byzantine Museum, which houses Christian art from the 4th to the 19th century; then visit either the Goulandris Cycladic and Greek Ancient Art Museum or the Benaki Museum—whichever you missed on Day 3. Another option is to check out the city\'s contemporary art scene at Technopolis or Athinais. In the evening, splurge on a meal at Aristera-Dexia; then dance the <i>tsifteteli</i> (the Greek version of a belly dance) to Asia Minor blues in a rembetika club, or, if it\'s summer, visit the coastal stretch where the bars stay open until dawn.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the last day, elbow your way through the boisterous Central Market; then visit some of the many galleries that dot the area. Cut over to Kerameikos, Athens\'s ancient cemetery. After lunch in Thission, try a complete change from the urban pace: take the metro to the lovely suburb of Kifissia and view the grand homes from a horse-drawn carriage, shop, or relax in one of the many cafés. As an alternative, catch a bus near the Zappion hall entrance of the National Garden and head to one of the government-run beaches in Varkiza, Vouliagmeni, or Voula.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Classical Glories</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You don\'t have to look far in Athens to encounter perfection. Towering above all—both physically and spiritually—is the Acropolis, the ancient city of upper Athens and the stonied remains of one of the greatest civilizations the West has ever produced. Sooner or later, you will climb the hill to witness, close-up, monuments of beauty and grace that have not been surpassed in 2 millennia. Nowhere, in fact, has ancient allure been more elegantly expressed than in the six caryatids that support the porch of the Erechtheion. No matter that these maidens are copies (the originals are in the Acropolis\'s museum). When the setting sun bathes them in rosy hues, these great sculptures of the 5th century BC fire the imagination. The few friezes that remain in situ at the Parthenon, the loftiest point of the Acropolis, are enough to evoke the splendor with which this masterpiece of Doric architecture was once adorned.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The ancient temples of Athens no longer serve their original purpose, but the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, a theater built into a hillside, still welcomes audiences to performances for part of the year. And at the National Archaeological Museum, a 3,500-year-old funeral mask is but one of the treasures reflecting centuries of artistic achievement. Pay a visit to the Hephaistion, the well-preserved Doric temple that graces the Agora, the marketplace and hub of everyday life in ancient Athens.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Walking Tour: The Acropolis, Filopappou & Environs</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you see nothing else in Athens, you must visit the <b>Acropolis</b>. Even jaded Athenians, when overwhelmed by the city, feel renewed when they lift their eyes to this great monument. Take the metro to the Acropolis station, where the New Acropolis Museum is under construction. Follow the pedestrianized street Dionyssiou Aerogapitou, which traces the foothill of the Acropolis to its entrance at the Beulé Gate. Buildings include the architecturally complex Erechtheion temple, most sacred of the shrines of the Acropolis, and the Parthenon, which dominates the Acropolis and, indeed, the city skyline: it is the most architecturally sophisticated temple of its period. Time and neglect have given its marble pillars their golden-white shine, and the beauty of the building is made all the more stark and striking.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While on the outcrop, pause at the edge of the southern fortifications, where, on a clear day, you can see the coastline toward Sounion and the Saronic Gulf islands of Aegina and Salamina. Leave time for the <b>Acropolis Museum</b>, which houses some superb sculptures from the Acropolis, including most of the caryatids and a large collection of colored statues of women dedicated to the goddess Athena. (When the New Acropolis Museum opens by the end of 2006, this collection will move there). As you exit the gate, detour right to the rock of <b>Areopagus</b>, the ancient supreme court, from which St. Paul later preached to the Athenians.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cross Dionyssiou Areopagitou to <b>Filopappou</b>; before climbing the summit, via the footpaths crisscrossing the hill, stop at tiny <b>Ayios Dimitrios Loumbardiaris</b> church, and then have a coffee at the tourist pavilion. Descend Dionyssiou Areopagitou, past the <b>Odeon of Herod Atticus</b> and the Hellenistic <b>Theater of Dionyssos</b>. Across the street is the controversial <b>New Acropolis Museum</b>. The huge, modern museum will showcase the treasures of the Parthenon and will feature glass floors so that you can peer down into the ongoing archaeological excavations. Nearby is the <b>Ilias LALAoUNIS Jewelry Museum</b>, with more than 3,000 pieces and a workshop where visitors can observe ancient techniques still used today.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Timing</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Such is the beauty of the Acropolis and the grandeur of the setting that a visit in all seasons and at all hours is rewarding. In general, the earlier you start out the better. By noon, the summer heat is blistering and the reflection of the light thrown back by the rock and the marble ruins almost blinding. An alternative, in summer, is to visit after 5 PM, when the light is best for taking photographs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In any season the ideal time might be the two hours before sunset, when occasionally the fabled violet light spreads from the crest of Mt. Hymettus (which the ancients called \"violet-crowned\") and gradually embraces the Acropolis. After dark the hill is spectacularly floodlighted, visible from many parts of the capital. A moonlight visit—sometimes scheduled by the authorities during full moons in summer—is highly evocative. In winter, if there are clouds trailing across the mountains, and shafts of sun lighting up the marble columns, the setting takes on an even more dramatic quality.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Depending on the crowds, the walk takes about four hours, including one spent in the Acropolis Museum. The Ilias LALAoUNIS Jewelry Museum is closed Tuesday, so you may want to take this tour another day.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The collection (more than 20,000 items are on display in 36 rooms, and that\'s only a sample of the holdings) moves chronologically from the ground floor upward, from prehistory to the formation of the modern Greek state. You might see anything from a 5,000-year-old hammered gold bowl to an austere Byzantine icon of the Virgin Mary to Lord Byron\'s pistols to the Nobel medals awarded to poets George Seferis and Odysseus Elytis. Some exhibits are just plain fun—the re-creation of a Kozani (Macedonian town) living room; a tableau of costumed mannequins; a Karaghiozi shadow puppet piloting a toy plane—all contrasted against the marble and crystal-chandelier grandeur of the Benaki home. The mansion was designed by Anastassios Metaxas, the architect who helped restore the Panathenaic Stadium. The Benaki\'s gift shop, a destination in itself, tempts with exquisitely reproduced ceramics and jewelry.

Other collections focus on Greek art from the Bronze Age through the 6th century AD.

Even in its bleached and silent state, the Parthenon—the great Panathenaic temple that crowns the rise—has the power to stir the heart as few other ancient relics can. Seeing it bathed in the sunlight of the south, or sublimely swathed in moonlight, has caused more than a few people to marvel at the continuing vitality of this monument.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The term Akropolis (to use the Greek spelling) refers to the ancient Athenian \"upper city\" that occupies the tablelike hill. Foundations for a grand new temple honoring the city\'s patron, the goddess Athena, were laid after the victory at Marathon in 490 BC but were destroyed by Persians in 480-79 BC. After a 30-year building moratorium, ended by the peace treaty at Susa in 448 BC, Pericles undertook the ambitious project of reconstructing the temple on a titanic scale. Some sc
holars consider this extraordinary, enigmatic Athenian general to be the brilliant architect of the destiny of Greece at its height, while others conclude he was a megalomaniac who bankrupted the coffers of an empire and an elitist who catered to the privileged few at the expense of the masses.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The appearance of the buildings that composed the major portion of the Acropolis remained largely unaltered until AD 52, when the Roman emperor Claudius embellished its entrance with a flamboyant staircase. In the 2nd century Hadrian had his turn at decorating many of the shrines, and in 529 Justinian closed the philosophical schools, emphasizing the defensive character of the citadel and changing the temples into Christian churches.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You enter through the <b>Beulé Gate,</b> a late-Roman structure named for the French archaeologist Ernest Beulé, who discovered it in 1852. Made of marble fragments from the destroyed monument of Nikias on the south slope of the Acropolis, it has an inscription above the lintel dated 320 BC, dedicated by \"Nikias son of Nikodemos of Xypete,\" who had apparently won a musical competition. Before Roman times, the entrance to the Acropolis was a steep processional ramp below the Temple of Athena Nike. This Sacred Way was used every fourth year for the Panathenaic procession, a spectacle that ended the festival celebrating Athena\'s remarkable birth (she sprang from the head of her father, Zeus); events included chariot races, athletic and musical competitions, and poetry recitals. Toward the end of July, all strata of Athenian society gathered at the Dipylon Gate of Kerameikos and followed a sacred ship as it was wheeled to the Acropolis. The ship was then anchored at the rocky outcrop below Areopagus, northwest of the Acropolis.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Propylaea</b> is a typical ancient gate, an imposing structure designed to instill proper reverence in worshippers as they crossed from the temporal world into the spiritual world of the sanctuary, for this was the main function of the Acropolis. Conceived by Pericles, the Propylaea was the masterwork of the architect Mnesicles. It was to have been the grandest secular building in Greece, the same size as the Parthenon. Construction was suspended during the Peloponnesian War, and it was never finished. The Propylaea was used as a garrison during the Turkish period; in 1656, a powder magazine there was struck by lightning, causing much damage; and the Propylaea was again damaged during the Venetian siege under Morosini in 1687.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Propylaea shows the first use of both Doric and Ionic columns together, a style that can be called Attic. Six of the sturdier fluted Doric columns, made from Pendelic marble, correspond with the gateways of the portal. Processions with priests, chariots, and sacrificial animals entered via a marble ramp in the center (now protected by a wooden stairway), while ordinary visitors on foot entered via the side doors.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The slender Ionic columns (two-thirds the diameter of the Doric) had elegant capitals, some of which have been restored along with a section of the famed paneled ceiling, originally decorated with gold eight-pointed stars on a blue background. The well-preserved north wing housed the Pinakotheke, or art gallery, specializing in paintings of scenes from Homer\'s epics and mythological tableaux on wooden plaques. Connected to it was a lounge with 17 couches arranged around the walls so that weary visitors could enjoy a siesta. The south wing was a decorative portico (row of columns). The view from the inner porch of the Propylaea is stunning: the Parthenon is suddenly revealed in its full glory, framed by the columns.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The 2nd-century traveler Pausanias referred to the <b>Temple of Athena Nike</b> as the Temple of Nike Apteros, or Wingless Victory, for \"in Athens they believe Victory will stay forever because she has no wings.\" Designed by Kallikrates, the minitemple was built in 427-424 BC to celebrate peace with Persia, with four Ionic columns at each portico end. The bas-reliefs on the surrounding parapet depicting the Victories leading heifers to be sacrificed must have been of exceptional quality, judging from the portion called \"Nike Unfastening Her Sandal\" in the Acropolis Museum. The best sections of the temple\'s frieze, which includes the Battle of Plataia with Greeks fighting the Persians, were whisked away to the British Museum two centuries ago and replaced with cement copies. In 1998 Greek archaeologists began the arduous task of dismantling the entire temple for conservation. The marble is being laser-cleaned to remove generations of soot; when the cleaning is finished, which the Ministry of Culture has announced will be by the end of 2006, the temple will be rebuilt on its original site. The temple\'s sculpted reliefs, on display in the Acropolis Museum, are scheduled to be moved to the New Acropolis Museum when it opens.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the loftiest point of the Acropolis is the <b>Parthenon,</b> the architectural masterpiece conceived by Pericles and executed between 447 and 438 BC by the brilliant sculptor Pheidias, who supervised the architects Iktinos and Kallikrates in its construction. Although dedicated to the goddess Athena (the name Parthenon comes from the Athena Parthenos, or the virgin Athena) and inaugurated at the Panathenaic Festival of 438 BC, the Parthenon was primarily the treasury of the Delian League, an ancient alliance of cities. For the populace, the Erechtheion—<i>not</i> the Parthenon—remained Athena\'s holiest temple. Metal scaffolding around the Parthenon is part of an ongoing preservation project; several sections have been removed and all the scaffolding is expected to come down by the end of 2006 when this phase of renovation works is completed.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the Parthenon\'s features, or \"refinements,\" is the way it uses <i>meiosis</i> (tapering of columns) and <i>entasis</i> (a slight swelling so that the column can hold the weight of the entablature), thus deviating from strict mathematics and breathing movement into the rigid marble. Architects knew that a straight line looks curved and vice versa, so they built the temple with all the horizontal lines somewhat curved. The columns, it has been calculated, lean toward the center of the temple; if they were to continue into space, they would eventually converge to create a huge pyramid.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though the structure of the Parthenon is of marble, the inner ceilings and doors were made of wood. The original building was ornate, covered with a tile roof, decorated with statuary and marble friezes, and so brightly painted that the people protested, \"We are gilding and adorning our city like a wanton woman\" (Plutarch). Pheidias himself may have sculpted some of the exquisite, brightly painted <i>metopes</i> (the recessed spaces between the raised blocks on the frieze), but most were done by other artists under his guidance. The only ones remaining on site show scenes of battle: Athenians versus Amazons, and gods and goddesses against giants.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the most evocative friezes, depicting the procession of the Panathenaia, was 524 feet long, an extraordinary parade of 400 people, including maidens, magistrates, horsemen, and musicians, and 200 animals. To show ordinary mortals, at a time when almost all sculpture was of mythological or battle scenes, was lively and daring. About 50 of the best-preserved pieces of this panel, called the Parthenon Marbles by Greeks but known as the Elgin Marbles by almost everyone else, are in the British Museum in London; a few others can be seen in the Acropolis Museum. In the first decade of the 19th century, during the time of the Ottoman Empire, Lord Elgin, British ambassador in Constantinople, was given permission by the Sultan Selim III to remove stones with inscriptions from the Acropolis; he took this as permission to dismantle shiploads of sculptures. The removal remains controversial to this day: on one side, many argue that the marbles would have been destroyed if left on site; on the other side, a spirited long-term campaign aims to have them returned to Greece, to be appreciated in their original context. The New Acropolis Museum is being built with a special room for the marbles, in which they would be laid out in their original order; it will also have glass walls through which the temple the marbles once adorned will be clearly visible.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If the Parthenon is the masterpiece of Doric architecture, the <b>Erechtheion</b> is undoubtedly that of the more graceful Ionic order. A considerably smaller structure than the Parthenon, it outmatches all other buildings of the Greco-Roman world for sheer elegance and refinement of design and execution. More than any other ancient monument, this temple has its roots in the legendary origins of Athens. Here it was that the contest between Poseidon and Athena took place for the possession of the city. On this spot, the sea god dramatically plunged his trident into the rock and produced a spring of water; Athena created an olive tree, the main staple of Greek society. The panel of judges declared her the winner, and the city was named Athena. A gnarled olive tree outside the Erechtheion\'s west wall was planted where Athena\'s once grew, and marks said to be from Poseidon\'s trident can be seen on a rock wedged in a hole near the north porch. Completed in 406 BC, the Erechtheion was divided into two Ionic sanctuaries. The eastern one contained an olive-wood statue of Athena Polias, protector of the city, as well as a gold lamp that burned always, so large it was filled with fuel just once a year. The western part of the Erechtheion was dedicated to Poseidon-Erechtheus.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most delightful feature of the Erechtheion, which has undergone extensive repair, is the south portico, facing the Parthenon, known as the <b>Caryatid Porch.</b> It is supported on the heads of six strapping but shapely maidens (caryatids) wearing delicately draped Ionian garments, their folds perfectly aligned to resemble flutes on columns. What you see today are copies; except for the caryatid dismantled by Lord Elgin, now in the British Museum, the originals were removed in 1977 to the Acropolis Museum to protect them from erosion caused by air pollution. One theory about the origin of the term \"caryatid\" is that the Athenians, to punish the people of Caryae in Laconia for collaborating with the Persians, seized the women of Caryae—Caryatids—and enslaved them. Because they were stunningly beautiful, the name came to be used for any attractive woman, including the maidens on the temple.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once inaccessible to people with disabilities, the summit of the Acropolis can now be reached by elevator.

Be warned, however, that into 2007 the museum will be only partially open, with closed galleries marked by a red X on the floor plan by the main entrance. Underway is a grand-scale expansion and renovation that encompasses both a much-needed face-lift and a near doubling of gallery space; the plan will allow the museum to show works that have languished in storage for decades. The reorganized displays will be accompanied by enriched English-language information.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Holdings are grouped in five major collections: prehistoric artifacts (7th millennium BC to 1050 BC), sculptures, bronzes, vases and minor arts, and Egyptian artifacts. The museum\'s most celebrated display is the <b>Mycenaean Antiquities.</b> Here are the stunning gold treasures from Heinrich Schliemann\'s 1876 excavations of Mycenae\'s royal tombs: the funeral mask of a bearded king, once thought to be the image of Agamemnon but now believed to be much older, from about the 15th century BC; a splendid silver bull\'s-head libation cup; and the 15th-century BC Vaphio Goblets, masterworks in embossed gold. Mycenaeans were famed for their carving in miniature, and an exquisite example is the ivory statuette of two curvaceous mother goddesses with a child nestled on their laps.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Withheld from the public since they were damaged in the 1999 earthquakes, but not to be missed, are the beautifully restored <b>frescoes from Santorini,</b> delightful murals depicting daily life in Minoan Santorini. Along with the treasures from Mycenae, these wall paintings are part of the museum\'s Prehistoric Collection.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Other stars of the museum include the works of Geometric and Archaic art (10th-6th centuries BC), and kouroi and funerary stelae (8th-5th centuries BC), among them the stelae of the warrior Aristion signed by Aristokles, and the unusual <i>Running Hoplite</i> (a hoplite was a Greek infantry soldier). The collection of Classical art (5th-3rd centuries BC) contains some of the most renowned surviving ancient statues: the bareback <i>Jockey of Artemision,</i> a 2nd-century BC Hellenistic bronze salvaged from the sea; from the same excavation, the bronze <i>Artemision Poseidon</i> (some say Zeus), poised and ready to fling a trident (or thunderbolt?); and the <i>Varvakios Athena,</i> a half-size marble version of the gigantic gold-and-ivory cult statue that Pheidias erected in the Parthenon.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Some of the most moving displays are those of funerary architecture: the spirited 2nd-century relief of a rearing stallion held by a black groom, which exemplifies the transition from classical to Hellenistic style, the latest period in the museum\'s holdings. Among the most famous sculptures in this collection is the humorous marble group of a nude <i>Aphrodite</i> getting ready to slap an advancing Pan with a sandal, while Eros floats overhead and grasps one of Pan\'s horns.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Light refreshments are served in a lower ground-floor café, which opens out to a patio and sculpture garden. www.culture.gr.

Conceived in 1870 as a way to allow Victorian-era visitors to experience nature without getting sand in their shoes, the Boardwalk became <i>the</i> place to see or be seen. Named for Alexander Boardman, the promenade\'s inventor—and not as you might think, for its wooden boards—the 4-mi-long Boardwalk begins in Atlantic City\'s Inlet section (at Maine Avenue), and heads south into neighboring Ventnor, where it continues for another 1½ mi (to Jackson Avenue). Saltwater taffy was invented on the Boardwalk in 1883, as legend has it, when a storm flooded a candy dealer\'s wares. The Boardwalk\'s attractions include amusement piers, museums, arcades, bars, restaurants, carnival games, and miniature golf. The <b>Steel Pier,</b> which once hosted the best music acts of the day as well as the famed diving-horse show, is now home to rides and carnival games. On the <b>Central Pier</b> you can ride go-carts or fire paintball rounds at human targets. Aside from strolling up and down the boards, the traditional way to experience the Boardwalk is to be pushed in a rolling chair. These wicker chairs evolved from the wheelchairs that infirm visitors used back when the city\'s promoters\' claimed the salty ocean air could cure all diseases. Despite medical evidence to the contrary, after a long stroll on the Boardwalk, you might have to agree. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

A variety of ferries and high-speed catamarans operate on Waitemata Harbour. Even better, go for a leisurely sail on the <i>Pride of Auckland,</i> or experience a genuine match race on America\'s Cup yachts with Sail NZ.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Cuisine &amp; Café Culture:</b> Some of the finest restaurants in the country reside in Auckland—and not just fine dining. The restaurant scene thrives from top-end down to bistro-cum-bars. Neighborhoods such as Ponsonby are crammed with vibrant eateries and cafés, their tables spilling onto the pavement, turning out fine fare for the discerning locals.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Year-Round Golf:</b> Frank Nobilo\'s hometown, Auckland, has more than 20 golf courses, from informal and easygoing to challenging championship level designed by the likes of Sir Bob Charles and Alister MacKenzie. Most have beautiful scenery, some with views of the Hauraki Gulf. Golf is played year-round here, and the green fees are among the cheapest anywhere.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Gorgeous Beaches:</b> The West Coast\'s black-sand beaches are best for surfing, whereas the safest swimming is on the East Coast. Beaches that have a reputation for large waves and rips are patrolled in the summer, so swim between the flags. The ozone layer is weak above New Zealand, so slap on the sunscreen.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Volcano Views</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Auckland is built on and around 48 volcanoes, and the tops provide sweeping views of the city. <b>One Tree Hill</b>, the largest of Auckland\'s extinct volcanoes, was the site of an early Maori settlement. <b>Mt. Eden</b>, the highest volcano on the Auckland isthmus, is probably the most popular, and several bus tours include this central site. <b>Rangitoto Island</b> has an even better vista. This volcano emerged from the sea 600 years ago, no doubt much to the wonder of the Maori people living next door on Motutapu Island. Take a ferry to the island; then either a short ride or an hour\'s walk to the top will give you a 360-degree view of the city and the Hauraki Gulf islands. It\'s thought that Maori settled on the volcanoes beginning in the 14th century, taking advantage of the fertile soils. There\'s evidence that in the 16th century, the Maori used the cones as defensive <i>pa</i> (fortified villages). Evidence of complex earthworks can be seen on Mt. Eden and One Tree Hill where Maori cleared volcanic stone to develop garden plots and formed the terraces that are features of <i>pa.</i></div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Music festivals happen year-round, with marquee names performing during SXSW in March and the Austin City Limits Music Festival in September, but also local affairs like the Armadillo Christmas Bazaar (December) and the Old Pecan Street Arts Festivals occurring in the spring and fall.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>World-class BBQ &amp; Ethnic Food.</b> Austinites are passionate seekers of, and arguers about, great restaurants and food, not only of the old standbys (barbecue joints and authentic Mexican and Tex-Mex eateries), but a wide spectrum of world cuisines, for all tastes and budgets.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>City of the Future.</b> Austin isn\'t only one of the best cities in the U.S. for free wireless Internet access (practically every hotel lobby has it), it\'s forward-looking in such areas as sustainability (green buildings, parkland), revitalizing its downtown through encouraging mixed-use residential and retail space, and promoting free and low-cost public transit. As a result, Austin\'s downtown is a hip, happening place.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Cowboy Culture.</b> The Star of Texas Fair &amp; Rodeo in March is a prime opportunity to immerse yourself and your family in a classic rodeo-and-cattle atmosphere, complete with cook-offs, comedy, concerts, and other wholesome entertainment. Your kids will never forget it, and the odds are you won\'t, either. And if you\'d like to bring home some genuine cowboy boots, those are easy to find around here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The Great Outdoors.</b> Austinites take full advantage of their city\'s mostly mild, sunny climate and abundant green space. When they\'re not working, they\'re likely running or riding on the hike-and-bike trails along Lady Bird Lake, swimming at Barton Springs or Deep Eddy Pool, golfing at a public course like Lions Municipal, or boating on Lake Travis.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Getting There</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The major entryway into Austin is I-35. Loop 1 (also known as MoPac) joins with I-35 on Austin\'s northern and southern outskirts, dispersing traffic to the west side of the city. U.S. 183 runs at a slight north-south diagonal through Austin. Although it doesn\'t serve any major cities, U.S. 183 does serve as a major thoroughfare through town, eventually meandering northward to western Oklahoma and southward toward the gulf. East-west Highway 71 and U.S. 290 connect Austin and Houston.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Getting Around</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although the highways are clearly marked, many of them have been granted other names as they pass through Austin (some joke that every road has at least two names). Keep in mind that U.S. 183 runs parallel to Research Boulevard for one stretch, Anderson Lane at another, and Ed Bluestein Boulevard at yet another, and Highway 71 is also known as Ben White Boulevard. Congress Avenue serves as the major north-south thoroughfare in the downtown area; it is interrupted at the State Capitol, Austin\'s heart and soul.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The rest of downtown is laid out in a conventional grid of numerical streets. The majority of these are one-way streets: even-numbered streets generally run one way to the west, and odd-numbered streets generally run one way to the east.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With 19 million annual visitors, more than 50,000 university students, and a large commuter population, Austin meets the demand with having more roads per capita than the other major cities in Texas—and it needs all of them. In fact, even with new highways and toll roads added in recent years, Austin\'s population growth has brought congestion, and it seems that every year rush hour gets longer, running weekdays from 7 to 9:30 AM and 4 to 7 PM, with Friday afternoon\'s rush starting a bit earlier. Driving can be irksome during rush hours, but Austin is generally navigable and car-friendly.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals with a Beat</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the self-proclaimed Live Music Capital of the world, it\'s needless to say the two largest festivals in town are all about music.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">September</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Austin City Limits Music Festival</b>. Austinites love any excuse to party outside, especially when music is involved. This unofficial farewell-to-summer shindig takes over Zilker Park for three days in late September. Fans come to hear 130 international, national, and local bands on eight stages. Performers have included the likes of Bob Dylan, Coldplay, Tom Petty, Bjork, the White Stripes, Sheryl Crow, Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, and the Indigo Girls. 2100 Barton Springs Rd., West Austin/Zilker Park. tel. 512/389-0315. www.aclfestival.com. COST: $50-$120.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">March</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>South by Southwest</b>. The granddaddy of all music fests arrives in early spring. Usually shortened to SXSW, this event\'s festivals and conferences combine to form a huge music, film, and interactive extravaganza. In addition to all the fans, SXSW brings a fleet of hundreds of hopeful musicians, producers, and record label execs to Austin to perform and network. It\'s such a take-over-the-city event that many Austin families evacuate town to some far-off spring break destination. Hotel rooms are scarce, restaurants and bars are packed, and everything from SXSW VIPs to plain, music-loving plebeians mix and mingle in expectation of finding \"the next big thing.\" First-time participants should know that it pays to be organized in terms of the bands you want to see since SXSW happens all over town.

Key had been detained onboard a truce ship, where he had been negotiating the release of one Dr. William Beanes, when the bombardment began; Key knew too much about the attack plan to be released. Through the next day and night, as the battle raged, Key strained to be sure, through the smoke and haze, that the flag still flew above Fort McHenry—indicating that Baltimore\'s defenders held firm. \"By the dawn\'s early light\" of September 14, 1814, he saw the 30-foot by 42-foot \"Star-Spangled Banner\" still aloft and was inspired to pen the words to a poem (set to the tune of an old English drinking song). The flag that flew above Fort McHenry that day had 15 stars and 15 stripes, and was hand-sewn for the fort. A visit to the fort includes a 15-minute history film, guided tour, and frequent living-history displays on summer weekends.

The museum also owns the world\'s second-largest collection of Andy Warhol works, and many pieces of 18th- and 19th-century American painting and decorative arts. The museum\'s neoclassical main building was designed by John Russell Pope, the architect of the National Gallery in Washington; the modern aluminum and concrete wing houses the contemporary art collection.

It features lizards, crocodiles, turtles, bats, and a black-headed python, among other animals from Down Under. The aquarium also features reptiles, birds, plants, and mammals in its rain-forest environment, inside a glass pyramid 64 feet high. The rain-forest ecosystem harbors two-toed sloths in calabash trees, parrots in the palms, iguanas on the ground, and red-bellied piranhas in a pool (a sign next to it reads do not put hands in pool). Each day in the Marine Mammal Pavilion, Atlantic bottlenose dolphins are part of several entertaining presentations that highlight their agility and intelligence. The aquarium\'s famed shark tank and Atlantic coral reef exhibits are spectacular; you can wind through an enormous glass enclosure on a spiral ramp while hammerheads and brightly hued tropical fish glide by.

Sure, boat tours are touristy, but the sights, from Khmer wats to bizarre riverside dwellings, are truly unique.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Street Food:</b> Bangkok may have the best street food in the world. Don\'t be afraid to try the weird stuff—it\'s often fresher and better than the food you\'d get at a hotel restaurant.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Shopping Bargains:</b> Forget Hong Kong and Singapore: Bangkok has the same range of high-end designer goods at much lower prices.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Sky-High Sipping:</b> \"Bar with a view\" is taken to the extreme when you sip martinis in open-air spaces that are 70 stories high.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Temple-Gazing:</b> From the venerable Wat Po to the little wats that don\'t make it into the guidebooks, Bangkok\'s collection of temples is hard to top.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Roaming the Waterways</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bangkok used to be known as \"Venice of the East,\" but many of the <i>klongs</i> (canals) that once distinguished this area have been paved over. Traveling along the few remaining waterways, however, is one of the city\'s delights. The water has been cleaned up and is no longer so black and smelly. You\'ll see houses on stilts, women washing clothes, and kids going for a swim. A popular trip to the Royal Barge Museum and the Khoo Wiang Floating Market starts at the Chang Pier near the Grand Palace.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ferries (sometimes called \"river buses\") ply the river. The fare for these express boats is based on the distance you travel; the price ranges from B10 to B32. The river can be an efficient way to get around as well as a sightseeing opportunity. Under the Saphan Taksin Skytrain stop, there is a ferry stop where passengers can cross the river to Thonburi for B3, saving themselves an hour\'s drive. Many hotels run their own boats from the pier near the Oriental. From here, you can get to the Grand Palace in about 10 minutes and the other side of Krungthon Bridge in about 15 minutes. Local line boats travel specific routes from 6 AM to 6 PM. If you are on Sukhumvit, Phetchaburi Road is a good place to catch them. These boats stop at every pier and will take you all the way to Nonthaburi, where you\'ll find a little island with vendors selling pottery—a pleasant afternoon trip when the city gets too hot.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A Chao Phraya Tourist Boat day pass is a fun introduction to the river. They are a bargain at B70 for the whole day. One advantage of the tourist boat is while traveling from place to place there\'s a running commentary in English about the historical sights along the river and how to visit them. The tourist boat starts at the pier under Saphan Taksin Skytrain station, but you can pick it up at any of the piers where it stops, and you can get on and off as often as you like.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Longtail boats (so called for the extra-long propeller shaft that extends behind the stern) operate like taxis. Boatmen will take you anywhere you want to go for B200 to B300 per hour. It\'s a great way to see the canals. The best place to hire these boats is at the Central Pier on Sathorn Bridge. Longtails often quit running at 6 PM.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For a blast into Bangkok\'s transportation past, traditional wooden canal boats are a fun (though not entirely practical) way to get around town. Klong Saen Saep, just north of Ploenchit Road, is the main boat route. The fare is a maximum B15, and during rush hour, boats pull up to piers in one-minute intervals. Klong boats provide easy access to Jim Thompson\'s House and are a handy alternative way to get to Khao San Road during rush hour.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Thai Puppetry</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For hundreds of years, Thailand\'s puppeteers have entertained both royal courts and village crowds with shadow puppets and marionettes. Historically the <i>Ramakien,</i> Thailand\'s version of the ancient Indian <i>Ramayana</i> epic, provided puppeteers with their subject matter. Today, performances are more varied: many stick to the <i>Ramakien</i> or other Thai folklore and moral fables; some are contemporary twists on the classic material; and some depart from it entirely. It\'s an art form that exemplifies Thailand\'s lively blend of tradition and innovation.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shadow Puppets</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shadow puppets—carved animal hide stretched between poles—showed up in Thailand during the mid-13th century. Historians believe the art form originated in India over 1,000 years ago and traveled to Thailand via Indonesia and Malaysia. By the 14th century shadow puppetry had become a leading form of entertaining in Ayutthaya, where it acquired the name <i>nang yai</i> or \"big skin,\" which is also what large shadow puppets are called.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Today nang yai troupes perform at village festivals, temple fairs, marriages, and royal ceremonies, as well as in theaters. Puppeteers maneuver colorful, intricately carved leather puppets behind a transparent backlit screen. A narrator and musicians help tell the story. A classical music ensemble called a <i>piphat</i> adds to the charged dramatic atmosphere with rapid-paced <i>ranat</i> (xylophone-like instrument), drums, and haunting oboe.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Large puppets (nang yai) are used to form the set at shadow puppet performances, while smaller puppets called <i>nang thalung</i> are the characters. There are some macabre traditions about how shadow puppets should be made, though it\'s unclear how often, if ever, these customs are followed today. Nang yai are supposed made with the hide of a cow or buffalo that has died a violent and accidental death, while nang thalung should be made with the skin from the soles of a dead puppet master\'s feet, so that the puppets are literally walking in the footsteps of the former artist. Clown characters\' lips should be formed from a small piece of skin from the penis of a deceased puppeteer.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Wherever the animal skin comes from these days, it must be carefully prepared. The hide is cured and stretched, then carved (puppet makers use stencils to outline the intricate, lacey designs) and painted. Puppet makers then mount the leather on sticks. You won\'t see shadow puppets for sale much, though some markets sell greeting cards with paper cut to resemble shadow puppets. You may see an authentic shadow puppet for sale at an antique market.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though today, shadow puppetry is much more common in Thailand\'s south, the largest shadow-puppet troupe in Thailand, <b>Nang Yai Wat Khanon Troupe</b> (T. Soifah., Amphur Photharam, Rachburi. tel. 03/223-3386), performs in Damnoen Saduak, at Wat Khanon, next to the floating market. Performances, which are on Saturdays at 10 AM and cost B200, are hour-long versions of Ramakien stories performed in Thai.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Marionettes</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Marionettes, born from a blend of shadow puppets and <i>khon,</i> a traditional form of Thai dance, entered the scene at the beginning of the</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">20th century when Krae Saptawanit, a renowned khon performer, began to make them. Krae\'s first two-foot-tall puppet was a miniature version of his own stage persona, with an elaborate costume, a golden mask, and long, curling finger extensions. Soon after, Krae formed a touring troupe of khon puppet performers.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Marionette choreography is highly stylized and symbolic. It takes three experienced puppeteers to manipulate each doll into a series of gymnastic twists and graceful dances moves. Puppeteers dance alongside and behind the puppets, but they remain in shadow; the dramatically lit and costumed dolls take center stage. As in nang yai, classical Thai music adds to the intense atmosphere and indicates the mood of the story.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The art of puppetmaking—or <i>hadtasin</i>—requires great attention to detail. Marionettes consist of a frame covered with papier-mâché. Most of the frame is made of wood. Parts that must be able to move independently—like the head, neck, and hands—are made of aluminum and wire, which are more malleable. The hand joints require the most attention, since they must be capable of intricate khon movements. Puppet makers must also attach the sticks the puppeteers will use to make the puppets move.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once the frame is constructed, the puppet maker adds layers of papier-mâché and then paints the top layer, paying particular attention to the face. The puppets wear ornate costumes of silk and gold leaf. According to tradition, the puppet maker must clap three times to create the completed marionette\'s soul.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the <b>Baan Tookkatoon Hookrabok Thai Puppet Museum</b> (Soi Vibavhadi 60, Laksi, Bangkok. tel. 02/579-8101. www.tookkatoon.com. OPEN: Mon.-Fri. 9-5), you can watch marionette-makers at work and purchase puppets. There\'s also a substantial private collection in the museum, which is a beautiful wooden house. You may even catch an impromptu show. Admission is free but advance booking is required.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Joe Louis Puppet Theatre</b> offers nightly shows with a live orchestra, professional singers, and elaborate sets. You can visit the theater\'s workshop and gallery before the show.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Where Else to See Shows</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chiang Mai is a hotspot for contemporary puppet troupes. <b>Hobby Hut</b> (www.cmaipuppet.com) and <b>Wandering Moon</b> (www.wanderingmoontheatre.com) are both based here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the southern province of Nakhon Si Thammarat, about three hours by bus from Krabi or Surat Thani, national artist and puppeteer Suchart Sapsin\'s house has been turned into the <b>Shadow Puppet Museum</b> (10/18 Si Thammarat Rd., Soi 3, Nakhon Si Thammarat. tel. 07/534-6394) with regular 20-minute performances (B100) in a small theater; a workshop; and a gallery.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Keep an eye out for performances at fringe festivals and temple fairs throughout the country.

The staff at your hotel can recommend reputable therapists. If you have the time, pull out all the stops with a two-hour massage. Spa treatments at top hotels tend to fill up at least a day in advance, so plan ahead.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The treatments at <b>Being Spa</b> (88 Sukhumvit Soi 51, Sukhumvit. tel. 02/258-7906. Skytrain: Thong Lo) take place in a Thai-style house. Among the inventive treatments are a coffee-bean body scrub and detoxifying algae and green-tea body wraps.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>COMO Shambhala</b> (Metropolitan Hotel, 27 S. Sathorn, Silom. tel. 02/625-3355. Subway: Lumphini; Skytrain: Sala Daeng) is the ultimate urban escape. The Metropolitan Bath starts with an invigorating salt scrub, followed by a bath and relaxing massage. Relax with some of their delicious ginger lemongrass tea.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A relaxing massage with deliciously warm oils is available at the <b>Four Seasons Hotel Bangkok</b> (155 Ratchadamri Rd., Siam Square. tel. 02/250-1000. Skytrain: Ratchadamri). You can even get a poolside massage if you like. The new <b>I. Sawan Spa</b> (Grand Hyatt Erawan, 494 Ratchadamri Rd., Pratunam. tel. 02/254-6310. Skytrain: Ratchadamri) offers massage rooms and other facilities that are among the city\'s most cutting-edge, relaxing, and beautiful. Day passes cost B500, not including any treatments. There are also \"residential spa cottages,\" suites clustered around a courtyard adjacent to the spa with their own treatment spaces; reasonably priced spa packages are available. The small <b>Jivita Spa House</b> (57/155 Silom Terrace Bldg., Saladaeng Soi 2, Silom. tel. 02/635-5422. Subway: Silom) is an oasis of calm and regeneration. There is a variety of treatments here, but the most unusual is the Japanese Healing Stone (using crystals, not stones).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A gentle massage in genteel surroundings is what you\'ll get at <b>Oriental Spa</b> (Oriental Hotel, 48 Oriental Ave., Silom. tel. 02/236-0400 Ext. 7440. Skytrain: Saphan Taksin). Amid the wood-panel sophistication you can treat yourself to facials, wraps, and massage. The Oriental\'s \"Ayurvedic Penthouse\" is a major addition to the Bangkok spa scene, with Ayurvedic massage treatments, that focus on holistic treatment. You\'ll sit for a quick quiz of sorts, which tells the masseuse how to treat your body based on your lifestyle.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A more low-key, inexpensive, but excellent option for traditional Thai massage is <b>Ruen Nuad</b> (Soi Convent, Silom. tel. 02/632-2662). A 90-minute massage will cost B700. Be aware that the place closes by 8 pm (actually a sign that it\'s legitimate and not a front for nefarious activities like many massage parlors). The Conrad Hotel\'s <b>Seasons Spa</b> (Conrad Hotel, All Seasons Place, 87 Wittayu, [Wireless Rd.], Sukhumvit. tel. 02/690-9999. Skytrain: Ploenchit) has 11 treatment rooms with views that are among the city\'s finest.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The temple\'s design is symmetrical, with a square courtyard containing five Khmer-style prangs. The central prang, which reaches 282 feet, is surrounded by four attendant prangs at each of the corners. All five are covered in mosaics made from broken pieces of Chinese porcelain. Energetic visitors can climb the steep steps to the top of the lower level for the view over the Chao Phraya; the less ambitious can linger in the small park by the river, a peaceful spot to gaze across at the city.

You may prefer the simplicity of some other wats, but you\'ll never quite get over Wat Phraw Kaew\'s opulence—no other wat in Thailand is so ornate or so embellished with glittering gold. As you enter the compound, take note of the 20-foot-tall statues of fearsome creatures in traditional battle attire standing guard. Turn right as you enter the compound, because on the inner walls are lively murals depicting the whole epic tale of the <i>Ramakien.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Several <i>aponsis</i> (mythical half-woman, half-lion creatures) stand guard outside the main chapel, which has a gilded three-tier roof. Inside sits the Emerald Buddha. This most venerated image of Lord Buddha is carved from one tiny piece of jade 31 inches high. No one knows its origin, but history places it in Chiang Rai in 1464. From there it traveled first to Chiang Mai, then to Lamphun, and finally back to Chiang Rai, where as the story goes the Laotians stole it and took it home with them. The Thais sent an army to get it back; it reached its final resting place when King Rama I built this temple. The statue is high above the altar, so you can see it only from afar. Behind the altar and above the window frames are murals depicting the life and eventual enlightenment of the Buddha. At the back of the royal chapel you can find a detailed scale model of Cambodia\'s Angkor Wat. COST: B200, included with admission to Grand Palace. OPEN: Daily 8:30-3:30. Metro: Skytrain: Hua Lamphong. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Jim Thompson\'s House</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Formerly an architect in New York City, Jim Thompson ended up in Thailand at the end of World War II, after a stint as an officer of the OSS (an organization that preceded the CIA). After a couple of other business ventures, he moved into silk and is credited with revitalizing Thailand\'s moribund silk industry. The success of this project alone would have made him a legend, but the house he left behind is also a national treasure. Thompson imported parts of several up-country buildings, some as old as 150 years, to construct his compound of six Thai houses (three are still exactly the same as their originals, including details of the interior layout). With true appreciation and a connoisseur\'s eye, Thompson then furnished them with what are now priceless pieces of Southeast Asian art. Adding to Thompson\'s notoriety is his disappearance: in 1967 he went to the Malaysian Cameron Highlands for a quiet holiday and was never heard from again. The entrance to the house is easy to miss—it\'s at the end of an unprepossessing lane, leading north off Rama I Road, west of Phayathai Road (the house is on your left). A good landmark is the National Stadium Skytrain station—the house is north of the station, just down the street from it. An informative 30-minute guided tour starts every 15 minutes and is included in the admission fee. The grounds also include a two-story silk and souvenir shop and a restaurant in the reception building that is great for a coffee or cold-drink break. COST: B100. OPEN: Daily 9-5:30.

Beginning with the city\'s Universal Exposition of 1888, the playful Catalan artistic impulse (evidenced in the works of Gaudí, Miró, and Dalí) and Barcelona\'s late-19th-century industrial prosperity teamed up with a surge in Catalonian nationalism to run rampant in the Eixample neighborhood, where bourgeois families competed with each other by decorating their opulent mansions.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A cultural movement that went beyond architecture, Modernisme affected everything from clothes to hairstyles to tombstones. Painters such as Ramón Casas and Santiago Russinyol, sculptors such as Miquel Blay and Eusebi Arnau, stained-glass artisans, ceramicists, acid engravers, and wood-carvers all contributed to the artistic explosion. The curved line replaced the straight; natural elements such as flowers and fruit were sculpted into facades; and the classical and pragmatic gave way to decorative ebullience.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Barcelona\'s Palau de la Música Catalana by Lluís Domènech i Montaner is a stunning compendium of Art Nouveau techniques, including acid-engraved and stained glass, polychrome ceramics, carved wooden arches, and sculpture. Josep Puig i Cadafalch\'s Casa Amatller and his Casa de les Punxes are examples of Modernisme\'s eclectic, historical tendency. Josep Graner i Prat\'s Casa de la Papallona, Joan Rubió Bellver\'s Casa Golferichs, Antoni Gaudí\'s Casa Batlló, and Salvador Valeri i Pupurull\'s Casa Comalat converted Barcelona\'s Eixample into a living Moderniste museum.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Ruta del Modernisme</b> is an itinerary through the Barcelona of Gaudì, Domènech i Montaner, and Puig i Cadafalch, the architects who, along with others, made Barcelona the world capital of Modernisme in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: palaces, private houses, the temple that has become a symbol of the city, and a huge hospital join pharmacies, lampposts, and benches—115 works in all—tracing Art Nouveau\'s explosion in Barcelona.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are three Modernisme Centers—Centre d\'Informació de Turisme de Barcelona (Plaça de Catalunya 17, Soterrani; Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau (Pavelló de Santa Apol.lònia, Carrer Sant Antoni Claret 167); and Pavellons Güell (Av. de Pedralbes 7)—that sell items related to the route, including a route pack with discount vouchers, a map showing all 115 works, a guide to Moderniste bars and restaurants, a pencil, a notebook, and a bag in which to carry it all.

In 2004 the museum\'s three collections—Romanesque, Gothic, and the Cambó Collection, an eclectic trove—were joined by the 19th- and 20th-century collection of Catalan impressionist and Moderniste painters. Also now on display is the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection of early masters, with works by Zurbarán, Rubens, Tintoretto, Velázquez, and others. With this influx of artistic treasure, the MNAC became Catalonia\'s grand central museum. Pride of place goes to the Romanesque exhibition: the world\'s finest collection of Romanesque frescoes, altarpieces, and wood carvings, most of them rescued from chapels in the Pyrenees during the 1920s to save them from deterioration, theft, and art dealers. Many, such as the famous <i>Cristo de Taüll</i> fresco (from the church of Sant Climent de Taüll in Taüll), have been reproduced and replaced in their original settings. www.mnac.es. COST: EUR 10.

It\'s an early Gothic basilica with Romanesque echoes and overtones; simple and spacious, this pure, classical space enclosed by soaring columns is something of an oddity in ornate and complex Moderniste Barcelona. Santa Maria del Mar (Saint Mary of the Sea) was built from 1329 to 1383, an extraordinarily prompt construction time in that era, in fulfillment of a vow made a century earlier by Jaume I to build a church to watch over all Catalan seafarers. The architect in charge of the construction, a mere stonemason named Montagut de Berenguer, designed a bare-bones basilica (an oblong Roman royal hall used for public meetings and later adapted for early Christian or medieval churches) that\'s now considered the finest existing example of Catalan (or Mediterranean) Gothic architecture. The number eight (or multiples thereof)—the medieval numerological symbol for the Virgin Mary—runs through every element of the basilica\'s construction: 16 octagonal pillars rise 16 meters before arching out another 16 meters to the painted keystones at the apex of the arches 32 meters overhead. The sum of the lateral aisles, 8 meters each, equals the width of the center aisle, and the difference in height between the central and lateral naves, 8 meters, equals their width. The result of all this proportional balance is a tonic sense of peace and enlightenment, an almost mystical poise enhanced by a lovely rose window whose circular mass in blues and crimsons perfectly offsets the golden sandstone verticality of the columns. Any excuse to spend time in Santa Maria del Mar, from eavesdropping on a wedding, to hearing a concert, to using it merely as a shortcut through to the Passeig de Born, is valid. The haunting \"Cant de la Sibil.la\" (\"Song of the Sibyl\"), performed on Christmas Eve before the midnight Mass, is a concert not to miss, and Handel\'s <i>Messiah</i> at Christmas and Haydn\'s <i>Creation</i> at Easter are also noteworthy annual events. Any chance to hear Renaissance choral music here—performances of the works of such composers as Tomás Luís de Victoria, Guerrero, Tallis, and Byrd—especially if performed by the Sixteen or the Tallis Scholars, is a special treat.

Named for and commissioned by Gaudí\'s main patron, Count Eusebio Güell, the park was intended as a hillside garden suburb on the English model. Barcelona\'s bourgeoisie seemed happier living closer to \"town,\" however, so only two of the houses were ever built and the Güell family eventually turned the land over to the city as a public park. Gaudí highlights here include an Art Nouveau extravaganza with gingerbread gatehouses topped with a hallucinogenic red-and-white fly ammanite wild mushroom (rumored to have been a Gaudí favorite) on the right and a <i>phallus impudicus</i> mushroom (no translation necessary) on the left. The gatehouse on the right holds the <b>Center for the Interpretation and Welcome to Park Güell,</b> with plans, scale models, photos, and suggested routes analyzing the park in detail. Other highlights include the <b>Gaudí Casa-Museu</b> (the house where Gaudí lived with his niece for 20 years), the Room of a Hundred Columns—a covered market supported by tilted Doric-style columns and mosaic-encrusted buttresses, and guarded by a patchwork lizard—and the fabulous serpentine, polychrome bench that snakes along the main square.

Metro: Lesseps. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Palau de la Música Catalana</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A riot of color and form, Barcelona\'s Music Palace is the flagship of the city\'s Moderniste architecture. Designed by Lluís Domènech i Montaner in 1908, it was originally conceived by the Orfeó Català musical society as a vindication of the importance of music at a popular level—as opposed to the Liceu opera house\'s identification with the Catalan (often Castilian-speaking monarchist) aristocracy. The Palau\'s exterior is remarkable in itself, albeit hard to see because there\'s no room to back up and behold it. Above the main entrance are busts of Palestrina, Bach, Beethoven, and (around the corner on Carrer Amadeu Vives) Wagner. Look for the colorful mosaic pillars on the second upper level, a preview of what\'s inside. The Miquel Blay sculptural group at the corner of Sant Pere Més Alt and Amadeu Vives depicts everyone from St. George the dragon slayer (at the top) to fishermen with oars over their shoulders.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The interior is an uproar. Wagnerian cavalry erupts from the right side of the stage over a heavy-browed bust of Beethoven, and Catalonia\'s popular music is represented by the flowing maidens of Lluís Millet\'s song \"Flors de Maig\" (\"Flowers of May\") on the left. Overhead, an inverted stained-glass cupola seems to offer the divine manna of music; painted rosettes and giant peacock feathers explode from the tops of the walls. Even the stage is populated with muselike Art Nouveau musicians, each half bust and half mosaic. The visuals alone make music sound different in here, and at any important concert the excitement is palpably thick; if you can\'t attend one, take a tour of the hall. www.palaumusica.org.

Metro: Catalunya. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museu Picasso</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Picasso spent key formative years (1895-1904) in Barcelona, when he was a young Bohemian, and never forgot these good times. (His <i>Demoiselles d\'Avignon</i> was, in fact, inspired by the eponymous Barcelona street known for its brothels, not by the French city.) A collection of his work can be found in Carrer Montcada, known for Barcelona\'s most elegant medieval and Renaissance palaces, five of which are occupied by the Picasso Museum. Though the 3,600-work permanent collection is strong on his early production, don\'t expect to find many of the artist\'s most famous works. Picasso\'s longtime crony and personal secretary Jaume Sabartés donated his private collection to this museum in 1960, and Picasso himself donated another 1,700 works in 1970. Displays include childhood and adolescent sketches, works from Picasso\'s Blue and Rose periods, and the famous 44 cubist studies based on Velázquez\'s <i>Las Meninas.</i> The sketches, oils, schoolboy caricatures, and drawings from Picasso\'s early years in La Coruña and, later, in Barcelona are perhaps the most fascinating part of the museum, showing the facility the artist possessed from an early age. His <i>La Primera Communión (First Communion),</i> painted at the age of 15, for which he was given a short review in the local press, was an important achievement for the young Picasso, and the Las Meninas studies and the bright <i>Pichones (Pigeons)</i> series provide a final explosion of color and light. <i>Suite 156,</i> a series of erotic and playful drawings on display when temporary exhibits allow space, may be the best of all. www.museupicasso.bcn.cat.

For freshwater pearls, and <i>more</i> knockoffs, try the Silk Alley Market or the Hongqiao Market.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Lama Temple</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The sweet smell of incense permeates one of the few functioning Buddhist temples in Beijing. When Emperor Yongzheng took the throne in 1723, his former residence was converted into this Lamaistic temple. During the Qianlong Period (1736-1795), it became a center of the Yellow Hat sect of Tibetan Buddhism. At its high point, 1,500 lamas lived here.

Notable sights are the Long Corridor, (a covered wooden walkway), and the Hall of Benevolent Longevity. At the west end of the lake is the famous Marble Boat that Cixi built with money intended to create a Chinese navy. The palace, which served as an imperial retreat from dripping summer heat, was ransacked by British and French soldiers in 1860 and later burned by Western soldiers seeking revenge for the Boxer Rebellion.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Confucius Temple</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This temple, with its towering cypress and pine trees, offers a serene escape from the crowds at nearby Lama Temple.

Also called Spring Festival, it gives the Chinese an official three-day—or longer—holiday to visit family and relatives, eat special meals, and set off firecrackers to celebrate the New Year and its respective Chinese zodiac animal. Students and teachers get up to four weeks off, and some factory workers don\'t have to work for as long as a month. It\'s a particularly crowded time to travel in China. Many offices and services reduce their hours or close altogether.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Spring Lantern Festival</b> marks the end of the Chinese New Year on the 15th day of the first moon.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Not so much a holiday as a day of worship, <b>Qing Ming</b> (literally,\"clean and bright\"), or Remembrance of the Dead, gathers relatives at the graves of the deceased on April 5th to clean the surfaces and leave fresh flowers.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Labor Day</b> falls on May 1, and is another busy travel time, as the Chinese get a weeklong holiday from work.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Dragon Boat Festival</b>, on the fifth day of the fifth moon (falling sometime in May or June), celebrates the national hero Qu Yuan, who drowned himself in the third century in protest against the corrupt emperor. Legend has it that people attempted to rescue him by throwing rice dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves into the river and frightening fish away by beating drums. Today crews in narrow dragon boats race to the beat of heavy drums, and rice wrapped in bamboo leaves is consumed.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On October 1st, <b>National Day</b> celebrates the founding of the People\'s Republic of China.

Construction began in the early 15th century under Yongle, whom many call the \"architect of Beijing.\" Set in a huge, serene, mushroom-shaped park, the Temple of Heaven is surrounded by splendid examples of Ming Dynasty architecture, including curved cobalt-blue roofs layered with yellow and green tiles. The Temple of Heaven was a site for imperial sacrifices, meant to please the gods so they would generate bumper harvests.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shaped like a semicircle on the northern rim to represent heaven and square on the south for the earth, the grounds were once believed to be the meeting point of the two. The area is double the size of the Forbidden City and is still laid out to divine rule: buildings and paths are positioned to represent the right directions for heaven and earth.

Anglo-French forces plundered, then burned, many of the palaces in 1860 and funds were diverted from China\'s naval budget for the renovations. Empress Dowager Cixi retired here in 1889. Nine years later, she imprisoned her nephew, Emperor Guangxu, after his reform movement failed. In 1903, she moved the seat of government from the Forbidden City to Yiheyuan from which she controlled China until her death in 1908.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nowadays, the place is undoubtedly romantic. Pagodas and temples perch on hillsides; rowboats dip under arched stone bridges; and willows branches brush the water. The greenery provides a welcome relief from the loud, bustling city. It\'s also a fabulous history lesson. You can see firsthand the results of corruption: the opulence here was bought with siphoned money. The entire gardens were for Dowager\'s exclusive use.

Inside, arches and posts are inscribed with Koranic verse, and a special moon tower helps with determining the lunar calendar. At the rear of the complex is a minaret from which a muezzin calls the faithful to prayer. Because Muslims must pray in the direction of Mecca, which, in Beijing, is toward the west, the main prayer hall opens onto the east.

The entire temple is decorated with Buddha images—all guarded by somber lamas (monks) dressed in brown robes. Originally a palace for Prince Yongzheng, it was transformed into a temple once he became the Qing\'s third emperor in 1723. The temple flourished under Emperor Qianlong, housing some 500 resident monks.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While the souvenir shops add some kitsch, the monks temper this with their own brand of serenity. And although indoor photography is prohibited, the exterior of the temple is quite photogenic: the walls are richly painted, and the monks peep through misty incense smoke. COST: Y25.

It has a lively, largely floating waterfront and good wildlife-watching nearby. <b>Alenquer,</b> across the Río Amazonas from Santarém, is a quintessential river town with lovely streams and waterfalls and ancient pictographs in its hinterlands. <b>Óbidos</b> is upstream from Santarém about 10 hours by regional boat in the \"narrows\" section of the river with a fort, complete with cannons, perching on a cliff overlooking the river. On an island, sleepy river town <b>Parintins</b> wakes up once a year for boi bumbá festivities.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Few tourists venture this deep into the culture and landscape. Only one tour company, Amazon Adventures (owned by the updater of this chapter), arranges these trips currently. But you can also just take a local boat. Someone at the boat docks can always tell you where your boat will be departing. All villages have food vendors. Your safest bet is a plate of rice and beans with beef, chicken, or fish. Smaller villages don\'t even have mineral water, and transportation is unreliable. Go well prepared and open-minded. In very small communities you may even be presented to the mayor or other town officials. Any attempt you make to communicate will be appreciated.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Bit of History</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spaniard Vicente Pinzón is credited with being the first to sail the Amazon, in 1500. But the most famous voyage was undertaken by Spanish conquistador Francisco de Orellano, who set out from Ecuador on a short mission to search for food in 1541. Instead of gold or a lost kingdom, however, Orellano ran into natives, heat, and disease. When he emerged from the jungle a year later, his crew told a tale of women warriors they called the Amazons (a nod to classical mythology), and the story lent the region its name. In the late 19th century, rubber production transformed Belém and Manaus into cities. Rubber barons constructed mansions and monuments and brought life\'s modern trappings into the jungle. Since the rubber era, huge reserves of gold and iron have been discovered in the Amazon. Land-settlement schemes and development projects, such as hydroelectric plants and major roadworks, have followed. In the process, vast portions of tropical forest have been indiscriminately cut; tribal lands have been encroached upon; and industrial by-products, such as mercury used in gold mining, have poisoned wildlife and people. The Brazilian government has established reserves and made some efforts to preserve the territory, but there is much more to be done.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Once considered unappealing—\"Victorian Grisly\" was the epithet used by more than one critic—today they are marvelous remnants of an age that considered show, pomp, and circumstance paramount. Most of these buildings are found within 20 blocks of each other and a time-travel walk can hit many of them, including City Hall, Linen Hall Library, the Grand Opera House, Crown Liquor Saloon, Ulster Hall, St. Malachy\'s Church, Albert Memorial Clock Tower, and St. Anne\'s Cathedral.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Belfast\'s Wall Murals</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In Northern Ireland they say the Protestants make the money and the Catholics make the art, and as with all clichés, there is some truth in it. It\'s a truth that will become clear as you look up at the gable walls of blue-collar areas of Belfast on which the two communities—Catholic and Protestant—have expressed themselves in colorful murals that have given rise to one of the more quirky tours of the city.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although the wildly romantic Catholic murals often aspire to the heights of Sistine Chapel-lite, those in Protestant areas (like the tough, no-nonsense Shankill and the Newtownards Road) are more workmanlike efforts that sometimes resemble war comics without the humor. It was not always this way.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In Protestant areas, murals were once painted by skilled coachbuilders to mark the July 12 celebrations of the defeat of the Catholic King James by King William at the Battle of the Boyne. As such, they typically depicted William resplendent in freshly laundered scarlet tunic and plumed cap, sitting on a white stallion that has mastered the art of walking on water. On the banks of the Boyne sits a mildly disheveled James, the expression on his face making him look as if he has just eaten an overdose of anchovies. Other popular themes in Protestant areas are the Red Hand of Ulster, symbolizing the founding of the province, and, on Carnmore Street, the 13 Protestant apprentice boys shutting the gates of Derry against King James in 1688, leading to the famous siege.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">More recently, though, Protestant murals have taken on a grimmer air, and typical subjects include walleyed paramilitaries perpetually standing firm against increasing liberalism, nationalism, and all the other isms that Protestants see eroding their stern, Bible-driven way of life. Nationalist murals, on the other hand, first sprang up in areas like the Falls Road in 1981, when IRA inmates of the Maze prison began a hunger strike in an unsuccessful bid to be recognized by the British government as political prisoners rather than common criminals. Ten died, and the face of the most famous, Bobby Sands, looks down now from a gable wall on the Falls Road alongside the words \"Our revenge will be the laughter of our children.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Since then, themes of freedom from oppression and a rising Nationalist confidence have expressed themselves in murals that romantically and surreally mix and match images from the <i>Book of Kells,</i> the Celtic Mist mock-heroic posters of Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick, assorted phoenixes rising from ashes, and revolutionaries clad in splendidly idiosyncratic sombreros and bandannas from ideological battlegrounds in Mexico and South America. Irish words and phrases that you will see springing up regularly include the much-used slogan \"Tiocfaidh ár lá\" (pronounced <i>chuck-y ohr law</i> and meaning \"Our day will come\") and the simple cry \"Saoirse\" (pronounced <i>seer</i>-she), meaning \"Freedom.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The murals in both Protestant and Catholic areas are safe to view in daylight and outside the sensitive week of the July 12 marches by Protestant Orangemen. However, the most sensible way to view them would be to take a guided tour with Citybus.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

At an estimated £1 billion, it will be Europe\'s largest urban waterfront regeneration scheme. The development was kicked off to honor the centenary of the launch of the <i>Titanic</i>—the luxury liner designed and built in the Harland and Wolff shipyard—in 2012. The Thompson Dock and Pump-House, or the Thompson dry dock as it is also known, is the only original part of the ship\'s legacy open to the public and represents <i>Titanic\'s</i> physical footprint. Built by 500 men over a period of seven years, it was the biggest dry dock in the world and was the beating heart of the shipyard\'s operation during the construction of the great White Star Liners—<i>Britannic</i>, <i>Olympic</i>, and RMS <i>Titanic</i>. The dock is nearly 900 feet long, could hold 21 million gallons of water, and the <i>Titanic</i> just about fitted in. The original steel-casing gate (now showing some signs of rust) that enclosed the dock and kept ships watertight, weighs a staggering 1,000 tons. Visitors can take an audiovisual guide in the pump-house, which also houses a visitor center located in the Northern Ireland Science Park at Queen\'s Island.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Two separate walking tours, both run by the affable and knowledgeable Colin Cobb, are well worth taking to help you capture your own slice of maritime magic. <b>Titanic Walking Tours</b> (028/9073-7813 www.titanicwalk.com £10 Mar.-Oct., daily at 12:30) departs from the Odyssey Arena and lasts two hours. The tour of Titanic\'s Dock and Pump-House (028/9073-7813 www.titanicsdock.com £5 Mar.-Oct., daily at 11 and 2) is a fascinating fact-filled walk helping visitors—through visual aids of the Titanic—imagine, relive, and reflect on the importance of shipbuilding in Belfast\'s heritage as well as taking in a masterpiece of engineering. There is no separate access to the pump house and all visitors must be on an accompanied tour. Hot snacks and sandwiches are available in the pump-house café and visitor center (open March-October, daily 10:30-4), where you can buy Titanic postcards and other souvenirs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With just two years to go to the 100th anniversary of the launch of the world\'s most famous liner, Belfast is cashing in big-time on the part it played. As well as Titanic boat trips (there\'s also a Titanic ghost boat tour) and guided walking tours, there are Titanic festivals, films, exhibitions, and an interactive trail, an active Titanic Society, and there\'s even a Thai Tanic restaurant in Eglantine Avenue.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Titanic Quarter promises to bring new life to a part of Belfast rich in history and ripe for development. It willinclude offices, hotels, restaurants, cafés, bars, andleisure facilities. The developers see it asa major social and business meeting place with galleries, theaters, parklands, and water sports all easily connected to Belfast\'s thriving city center.

First, the Folk Museum invites you to visit Ballycultra—a typical Ulster town of the early 1900s—which comes alive thanks to costumed guides who practice such regional skills as lace making, sampler making, spinning, weaving, wood turning, forgework, printing, open-hearth cooking, carpentry, basket making, and needlework. The setting is evocative: a score of reconstructed buildings moved here from around the region, including a traditional weaver\'s dwelling, terraces of Victorian town houses, an 18th-century country church, a village flax mill, a farmhouse, and a rural school. Across the main road (by footbridge) is the beautifully designed Transport Museum, where exhibits include locally built airplanes and motorcycles, as well as the iconoclastic car produced by former General Motors whiz kid John DeLorean in his Belfast factory in 1982. A miniature railway runs on Saturday. The museum is on the 70 acres of Cultra Manor, encircled by a larger park and recreation area. www.nmni.com. COST: £6.80. OPEN: Mar.-June, weekdays 10-5, Sat. 10-6, Sun. 11-6; July-Sept., Mon.-Sat. 10-6, Sun. 11-6; Oct.-Feb., weekdays 10-4, Sat. 10-5, Sun. 11-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Crown Liquor Saloon</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Opposite the Europa Hotel on Great Victoria Street and owned by the National Trust (the United Kingdom\'s official conservation organization), the Crown is one of Belfast\'s glories. It began life in 1826 as the Railway Tavern; in 1885 the owner asked Italian craftsmen working on churches in Ireland to moonlight on rebuilding it, and its place in Irish architectural pub history was assured. The bar has richly carved woodwork around cozy snugs (cubicles—known to regulars as \"confessional boxes\"), leather seats, color tile work, and an abundance of mirrors. The Crown entered a new phase in its history in November 2007 when the Trust spent £500,000 on a major restoration project. An ostentatious box of delights, it has been immaculately preserved—it is still lighted by gas. The pièce de résistance is the embossed ceiling with its swirling arabesques and rosettes of burnished primrose, amber, and gold, as dazzling again now as the day it was installed. The Crown claims to serve the perfect pint of Guinness—so no need to ask what anyone\'s drinking—and you can order a great plateful of oysters or warming Irish stew. When you settle down in your snug, note the little gunmetal plates used by the Victorians for lighting their matches as well as the newly restored antique push-button bells for ordering another round. Ageless, timeless, and classless—some would say the Crown is even priceless. www.crownbar.com.

Belize City is the commercial, social, sports, and cultural hub of the country. It\'s even the political hub, despite the fact that the capital, Belmopan, is an hour west. The current prime minister, Dean Barrow, a lawyer who came to power in February 2008, former prime ministers including Said Musa, many of the other ministers, and nearly all of the country\'s movers and shakers live in or near Belize City.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Great Photo Ops</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Belize City is highly photogenic, full of interesting faces, streets full of color, and charming old colonial houses. In short, Belize City has character.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Colonial Architecture</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Belize City rewards the intrepid traveler with a surprising number of interesting sights and memorable places, among them the everyday colonial-era buildings in the Fort George and Southern Foreshore sections, where people still live and work. For the most part, buildings are wood, with tin or zinc roofs. Many are in need of a bit of repair, but they still ooze Caribbean port-of-call atmosphere.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Because You Have To</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As a visitor to Belize, you\'ll almost certainly have to spend a little time in Belize City, whether you like it or not. The international airport is in Ladyville, at the northern edge of the city. Belize City is the transportation hub of the country, and most flights, buses, and car rentals originate here. If you\'re arriving late or leaving early, you\'ll have to overnight in or near the city. Make the best of it. Take care, but explore and enjoy the city.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">History</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Maya had long had small fishing camps—but no large cities—near the present-day site of Belize City, but they abandoned the area in the 1600s. A few English adventurers and pirates then established camps at the mouth of the Belize River and on cayes just offshore. They began cutting logwood, which was valued in Europe as a source of black dyes. In the 1700s the Bay Settlement, as it was called, received influxes of new British settlers, termed Baymen, and African slaves from Jamaica.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spain claimed Belize as a minor backwater of its New World domain, but Spain\'s influence dwindled after some of its Navy ships were defeated by a ragtag group of Baymen in 1798 at the Battle of St. George\'s Caye, 9 mi (15 km) off Belize City. Belize Town, as it was then called, became the main export center for logwood, and, later, mahogany. Belize City became the capital of the British colony of British Honduras in 1892, and by 1904 its population had grown to about 10,000.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Belize was one of Pax Britannia\'s most neglected colonies. The British, who were usually generous in such matters, left little of either great beauty or interest in their former colony\'s capital. Belize City\'s rough reputation began after two devastating hurricanes caused authorities to move the capital to Belmopan.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Press accounts of street crime made Belize City sound like south-central Los Angeles, though it was never as bad. In 1995 a Tourism Police unit was created to help cut down on crime, and officers on foot or bicycle patrol are now a familiar sight. To make getting around the city easier, roads were resurfaced and traffic lights were installed. More and more colonial buildings were restored, making the Fort George area an increasingly pleasant place to stay. Casino gaming was legalized.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city now gets more than three-quarters of a million cruise ship passengers annually. Late 2001 saw the unveiling of a cruise ship terminal and shopping area called Fort Point Tourism Village, and Carnival Cruise Lines plans to build a new US$50 million terminal in the Port Loyola area, with completion likely in 2008. Another proposal calls for building a causeway in the Belize City harbor out to Drowned Caye and Stake Bank Caye, and there developing, along with luxury hotels and a marina, another large cruise ship terminal. Conservationists strongly oppose this proposal, saying that it would disturb areas now home to a sizable population of manatees and would otherwise injure marine and bird life.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Made in Belize</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For such a little country, some of Belize\'s products pack a punch. Below is a list of possible souvenirs.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hot Sauce</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of Belize\'s best-known products comes from a little plant near Dangriga. This spicy sauce was originally created by Marie Sharp in her kitchen in the early 1980s. It comes in a variety of heat levels, from the moderate Mild Habanero to the fiery No Wimps Allowed, and, finally, Beware. <b>Marie Sharp\'s</b> also makes less dangerous products, such as jams, jellies, and other spices and sauces. Call ahead to set up an informal tour of the plant. 3 Pier Rd., Dangriga. tel. 522/2370 or 520/2087.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rum</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A favorite of rum connoisseurs, One Barrel, from <b>Travellers Ltd.</b> (Box 623, Belize City. tel. 223/2855), has won international tasting awards in the gold rum category; Duurley\'s, another Travellers product, is also delicious. The company is run by the Perdomo family of Belize City. For distillery tours, contact Travellers Liquors Ltd. A good mixing white rum, and the one you\'ll see in most bars, is called Caribbean Rum. It is made by family-owned <b>Cuellos</b> (2 Miles, Yo Creek Rd., Orange Walk Town. tel. 322/2141) distillery, which offers occasional distillery tours. Most rum is between BZ$14 and BZ$20 a bottle.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hardwood Furniture</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If the cost of shipping doesn\'t break your budget, the low-slung folding \"clam chairs\" are a favorite and made from the region\'s tropical hardwood. <b>New Hope Woodworking, Ltd.</b> (Buena Vista St., San Ignacio, Cayo. tel. 824/2188) makes portable, small wooden boxes. <b>New River Enterprises</b> (14 Westby St., Orange Walk Town. tel. 322/2225) makes solid mahogany and other hardwood doors, some around BZ$2,400 plus shipping. They also make patio furniture. <b>Hummingbird Rattan</b> (54 Hummingbird Hwy., Belmopan City. tel. 822/3164. Coconut Dr., San Pedro. tel. 226/2960) uses bamboo, wicker, and rattan, sometimes mixed with mahogany, for indoor and outdoor furniture.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Coffee</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Gallon Jug Estates</b> in Orange Walk District is the only commercial coffee producer in Belize (and it is small, with only about 100 acres of coffee plantings). Made with only arabica beans, Gallon Jug coffees are shade-grown and don\'t use pesticides, herbicides, or fungicides. Whole bean and ground coffee, packed in colorful gold and green, can be bought all over Belize.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beer</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With a nationwide monopoly on beer, the <b>Belize Brewing Co. Ltd.</b> is one of the country\'s most profitable businesses. The beer is perfect for sipping on the beach and there are four types to choose from: a lager, with 4% alcohol; Belikin Premium, also a lager, with 5% alcohol; Lighthouse, a pale lager, with 4.2% alcohol; and Belikin Stout, a dark beer with 6% alcohol. If none of these are to your liking, a few other foreign brands, such as Bud, Red Stripe, and Heineken, are available at a much inflated cost. Some cruise ship and Belize City tours include a stop at the Bowen brewery, and a half-hour tasting of the beers. For information, contact 1 King St., Belize City. tel. 227/2602.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The big cat growls a deep rumbling threat. You jump back, thankful that a strong but inconspicuous fence separates you and the jaguar.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the smallest, but arguably one of the best, zoos in the world, the Belize Zoo packs a lot into 29 acres. Containing more than 125 native species, the zoo has self-guided tours through several Belizean ecosystems—rain forest, lagoons, and riverine forest. Along with the rare black jaguar and the spotted jaguar, you\'ll see the country\'s four other wild cats: the puma, margay, ocelot, and jaguarundi. Perhaps the zoo\'s most famous resident is April, a Baird\'s tapir that is more than a quarter century old. This relative of the horse and rhino is known to locals as the mountain cow, and is also Belize\'s national animal. At the zoo you can also see jabiru storks, a harpy eagle, scarlet macaws, crocodiles, and many snakes, including the fer-de-lance. New at the zoo are bird-watching tours, ranging from day and overnight trips to week-long birding safaris.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The zoo owes its existence to the dedication and drive of one gutsy woman, Sharon Matola. An American who came to Belize as part of a film crew, Matola stayed on to care for some of the semi-tame animals used in the production. She opened the zoo in 1983 and in 1991 it moved to its present location. She\'s also an active environmentalist. \"The Zoo Lady\" and her crusade against the Chalillo Dam is the subject of the 2008 book The Last Flight of the Scarlet Macaw: One Woman\'s Fight To Save the World\'s Most Beautiful Bird by Outside magazine writer Bruce Barcott.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Besides touring the zoo, you can also hike or canoe through the nearby 84-acre Tropical Education Center. The center is involved in a green iguana breeding project. Dormitory accommodations, with outdoor toilets, are available at the center for BZ$60 per person; spiffier cabins go for BZ$132—BZ$143 double, including breakfast, dinner, and taxes. Cameron Diaz and the late Steve Erwin have stayed here. Overnighters can take a nocturnal zoo tour for BZ$30. For Tropical Education Center accommodations, call in advance, and be aware that the lodging area is a long hike from the zoo. www.belizezoo.org. COST: BZ$16 adults, BZ$8 children.

The museum divides into three separate collections, each housed in a different building.The large, neoclassical <b>Lysverket</b> building, farthest south, used to house the municipal power company, but was bought by the city council and reopened as an art museum in 2003. The permanent exhibit showcases both medieval icons and Dutch Renaissance masters.The <b>Stenersen Collection,</b> found in the northernmost museum building, is an extremely impressive collection of modern art for a town the size of Bergen. Modern artists represented include Max Ernst, Paul Klee, Vassily Kandinsky, Pablo Picasso, and Joan Miró, as well as Edvard Munch. There\'s also a large focus here on Norwegian art since the mid-18th century.The star of the complex, though, is undoubtedly the middle building that houses the <b>Rasmus Meyer Collection.</b> When the businessman Rasmus Meyer (1858-1916) was assembling his superb collection of works by what would become world-famous artists, most of them were unknowns. On display are the best Edvard Munch paintings outside Oslo, as well as major works by J. C. Dahl, Adolph Tidemand, Hans Gude, Harriet Backer, and Per Krogh.

Follow the cobblestone markers that remember the Wall\'s path from where it bordered the Reichstag and Spree River, past the Holocaust Memorial and rebuilt Potsdamer Platz, and along the street where the Gestapo was headquartered, to end at the famous border crossing, Checkpoint Charlie.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Affordability:</b> Of western and northern Europe\'s capitals, Berlin is by far the best bargain. Most museum prices remain under EUR 10, hotel rooms are expansive in comparison, and one night on the town won\'t rule out a second one.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Long, Creative Nights:</b> Berlin is the only European city without official closing hours, so you can stretch your drinks until the wee hours of the morning without fear of a last call. Young artists and bohemians from the world over keep coming up with installations, performance events, and unusual impromptu venues for parties and bars.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Symbols & Shifts in East & West</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The year 2009 marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of the infamous Berlin Wall, and pivotal spots that made history in November 1989 will be highlighted with small exhibits and information centers. Art projects such as larger-than-life dominos set up throughout the city will be knocked over—creating a ripple of falling \"stones\" throughout East and West—and a pop concert at the Brandenburg Gate on the evening of November 9th will recall an event that shaped world history. Many of today\'s Berliners, both from East and West, are <i>Einheitskinder</i>, children of German reunification, and have no recollection of the troubled days of division. After two decades, normalcy had descended upon \"Ossis\" and \"Wessies,\" blurring all differences but in some slang, income, and the general outlook on life.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Berlin is still a city that protects the character of each <i>Kiez</i>, or neighborhood, which has more to do with social reasons than East vs. West. In many areas, such as Prenzlauer Berg and northern Mitte, two proud Eastern districts, the former population has all but vanished: first affluent West Berlin families moved in, and now, even richer West German or foreign \"invaders\" are taking over leases. At the same time, new niche districts with a low-budget, but artsy, young scene are emerging; Friedrichshain is hotter than ever, and some gurus even talk of Neukölln or Lichtenberg as being the next it place to be.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The days of <i>Ostalgie</i> (nostalgia for the East) have long passed, and East Germany\'s iconography is trendy only for out-of-towners. Nevertheless, many East Berlin designs have crept into the daily life of all Berliners, such as the figure that appears on the crosswalk traffic lights. The stocky East Berlin <i>Ampelmann</i> (\"street-light man\") wears a wide-brim hat and walks with an animated gait, and is now used for every crosswalk in Berlin—he also adorns coffee cups and T-shirts, and there\'s even candy made in his image. Entire gift shops are dedicated to him, such as in the Hackesche Höfe in Mitte and the Arkaden mall at Potsdamer Platz.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The 18th-century Prussian Brandenburg Gate may be the city symbol for Berlin tourism, but the East German soaring television tower, the Berliner Fernsehturm, is an enormously popular silhouette for Berlin-based companies\' logos, nightclubs\' flyers, and advertisements of all sorts. Emblematic icons of the Cold War and Berlin\'s division, such as the old central railway station Bahnhof Zoo in West Berlin, the Tempelhof Airport, and the former Palast der Republik, have lost their function, have been closed, or even torn down. The passing of these symbols confirms that the East-West discourse is no longer a real issue, and that Berlin is ready to move on.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Works by Cézanne, Rodin, Degas, and one of Germany\'s most famous portrait artists, Max Liebermann, are part of the permanent exhibition. Its Galerie der Romantik (Gallery of Romanticism) collection has masterpieces from such 19th-century German painters as Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Caspar David Friedrich, the leading members of the German Romantic school. The <b>Altes Museum</b> (Old Museum), a red-marble, neoclassical building abutting the green Lustgarten, was Prussia\'s first building purpose-built to serve as a museum. Designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, it was completed in 1830. Until fall 2009, when the collection will relocate to the then completely restored Neues Museum, it serves as home to the Egyptian collection, which traces Egypt\'s history from 4000 BC and whose prize piece is the exquisite 3,300-year-old bust of Queen Nefertiti. The permanent collection of the Altes Museum consists of everyday utensils from ancient Greece as well as vases and sculptures from the 6th to 4th centuries BC. Etruscan art is its highlight, and there are a few examples of Roman art. Antique sculptures, clay figurines, and bronze art of the Antikensammlung (Antiquities Collection) are also housed here; the other part of the collection is in the Pergamonmuseum. At the northern tip of Museum Island is the <b>Bode-Museum</b>, a somber-looking gray edifice graced with elegant columns. Reopened in 2006, it now presents the state museums\' stunning collection of German and Italian sculptures since the Middle Ages, the Museum of Byzantine Art, and a huge coin collection. Even if you think you aren\'t interested in the ancient world, make an exception for the <b>Pergamonmuseum</b> (entrance on Am Kupfergraben), one of the world\'s greatest museums. The museum\'s name is derived from its principal display, the Pergamon Altar, a monumental Greek temple discovered in what is now Turkey and dating from 180 BC. The altar was shipped to Berlin in the late 19th century. Equally impressive are the gateway to the Roman town of Miletus and the Babylonian processional way. Art and culture buffs who want to enjoy as many Berlin museums as possible should consider the Three-Day pass for EUR 19, which allows unlimited access to all of Berlin\'s state museums.

Since the Wall\'s dismantling, the sandstone gateway has become the scene of the city\'s Unification Day and New Year\'s Eve parties. This is the sole remaining gate of 14 built by Carl Langhans in 1788-91, designed as a triumphal arch for King Frederick Wilhelm II. Its virile classical style pays tribute to Athens\'s Acropolis. The quadriga, a chariot drawn by four horses and driven by the Goddess of Victory, was added in 1794. Troops paraded through the gate after successful campaigns—the last time in 1945, when victorious Red Army troops took Berlin. The upper part of the gate, together with its chariot and Goddess of Victory, was destroyed in the war. In 1957 the original molds were discovered in West Berlin, and a new quadriga was cast in copper and presented as a gift to the people of East Berlin. A tourist-information center is in the south part of the gate.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The gate faces one of Europe\'s most famous historic squares, <b>Pariser Platz,</b> a classicist piazza with bank headquarters, the ultramodern French embassy, as well as offices of the federal parliament. On the southern side, Berlin\'s sleek Academy of Arts, integrating the ruins of its historic predecessor, and the DZ Bank, designed by star architect Frank Gehry, are cheek-by-jowl with the new American embassy, opened on July 4, 2008, built on its prewar location.

Though he was born near Bern and spent most of his life in the country, his nationality was determined by the lineage of his father, who was German.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Born into a family of musicians, Klee played with chalk as a toddler and filled his schoolbooks with caricatures and images copied from magazines. At age 19 he left Bern to study drawing in Munich, but he couldn\'t support himself with his art and returned to his parents in 1902. Four years later he had saved enough from his work as a violinist with the Bern Music Society to marry pianist Lily Stumpf and move to Munich, where they lived until 1926.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A trip to Tunisia in 1914 clarified Klee\'s artistic calling. \"Color has taken possession of me,\" he wrote, upon encountering desert light. \"I am a painter.\" His signature became color—rendered in oil, watercolor, ink, or all three—and almost childlike paintings with a highly developed sense of poetry, music, and dreams. Recognition followed in the 1920s, with exhibitions in Paris and New York and a teaching postion at the Bauhaus from 1921. In 1933 the Nazis labeled him a degenerate, his academic position in Düsseldorf was terminated, and he and Lily emigrated to Switzerland. The apartment they took the following year in Bern\'s Elfenau district became his studio for the rest of his life.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1935 Klee began to show symptoms of severe fatigue and what was misdiagnosed as the measles turned out to be (determined after his death) scleroderma. He continued to paint, however, and produced more than 1,000 works the year before his death in the Ticino, where he had gone to convalesce. His ashes are buried in Bern\'s Schosshalde cemetery, next to today\'s Zentrum Paul Klee.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The Ensemble Paul Klee performs regular, varied, and colorful short concerts in the auditorium; guest artists from the worlds of theater and dance present productions, readings, and workshops (in German) with a pictorial slant.

The city broke ground in 1421 on the site of a smaller church that was dismantled once the cathedral\'s choir could accommodate Sunday worshippers, and work continued, with minor interruptions, for about 180 years. The finishing touch, the tip of the open, octagonal, 328-foot <b>steeple,</b> was added almost 200 years after that, in 1893.

The Guggenheim changed all that.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Frank Gehry\'s gleaming brainchild, hailed as \"the greatest building of our time\" (architect Philip Johnson),\"the best building of the 20th century\" (Spain\'s King Juan Carlos), and \"a miracle\" (Herbert Muschamp, <i>New York Times</i>), has sparked a renaissance in the Basque Country: in its first year, the museum attracted 1.4 million visitors, three times the number expected and more than what the Guggenheim museum in New York received in the same period. Revenue in the first year alone exceeded the original investment, and that was over a decade ago. The Guggenheim holds the Spanish record for single-day visits to a museum (9,300), and the crowds, though abating somewhat, have remained numerous since the museum opened.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The museum itself is as superlative as the hoopla suggests. The smoothly rounded, asymmetrical, ship\'s-prow-like amalgam of limestone, glass, and titanium ingeniously recalls Bilbao\'s shipbuilding and steel-manufacturing past while using transparency and reflective materials to create a shimmering, futuristic luminosity. The final section of the Nervión\'s La Salve Bridge is almost part of the structure, rendering the Guggenheim the virtual doorway to Bilbao.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The collection, described by director Thomas Krens as \"a daring history of the art of the 20th century,\" consists of 242 works, 186 from New York\'s Guggenheim and 50 acquired by the Basque government. Artists whose names are synonymous with the 20th century (Kandinsky, Picasso, Ernst, Braque, Miró, Calder, Malevich) and particularly artists of the \'50s and \'60s (Pollock, Rothko, De Kooning, Chillida, Tàpies, Iglesias) are joined by contemporary figures (Nauman, Muñoz, Schnabel, Badiola, Barceló, Basquiat).

The massive Southern Alps mountain chain divides the island lengthwise, and many outlying ranges spring up in the north. Extensive parklands make these mountains tantalizingly accessible—walk or ski them, or catch a helicopter to a glacier. In places like Kaikoura, farmers have banded together to create farm-to-farm hiking trails through otherwise inaccessible mountain, bush, and coastal areas.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Pub Life.</b> There\'s no better place to get time with the locals than in a small-town pub at night, especially on the West Coast. When the wind is howling outside, or the surf is roaring, the pubs feel even cozier. There\'s often a big fire in a corner fireplace and local farmers, miners, or tour guides standing around the bar, tall stories flowing with the beer. Should you blank on a topic of conversation, you can\'t go wrong with a rugby question—just don\'t mention the World Cup.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Wildlife.</b> The upper South Island is the habitat for some very interesting creatures. Tuatara, the last reptiles of their kind, live on the protected Stephens Island in Marlborough Sounds. South by Lake Moeraki, you may see fiordland crested penguins and New Zealand fur seals. On the other side of the island, along the Kaikoura Coast, you can get very close to whales, dolphins, and seals in the wild. In and around the Marlborough Sounds you\'re likely to see dolphins on a daily basis and killer whales in season. The Abel Tasman coastline is home to several colonies of fur seals.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Wine.</b> It took only a couple of decades for Marlborough to become one of the world\'s great wine-making regions. The sunny-day-cool-night climate means grapes come off the vines plump with flavor, and that translates into wines with aromas that burst out of the glass. It\'s an exciting feistiness that some consider too unbridled—but the wine is delicious. At any of the smaller wineries, you\'ll likely share your first taste with the winemakers themselves.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Close Encounter with Dolphins</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Near the inner entrance to Tory Channel, Dan, the boatman, skillfully brought the boat around as six of us slid into the water right beside a pod of playful Dusky dolphins. The 15-minute boat ride from Torea Bay had given us time to change, have a quick biology lesson, and learn a bit more about the dolphins. Although not as big as the common bottlenose dolphins, these beautiful silvery creatures were still at least 6 feet long and strongly built. As we lay face down in the water, buoyant in our thick wet suits, the dolphins blasted up from the depths to swim right by us, time and again. Fins, masks, and snorkels made it easier to watch them as they swirled and twirled around us. They never touched us, but wheeled and turned just inches away. As they swam by, they turned on their sides and looked at us with their dark little eyes, their strong tails pushing them through the water. At other times they leaped from the water and came back down with a resounding splash. This was better than any wildlife documentary.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">News from the Grapevine</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">New Zealand\'s rugged landscape leads to major differences between the grape-growing regions, even if they\'re small in scale. This diversity means that most of Europe\'s great grapes have found a second home somewhere in the country. Pinot noir in particular is benefiting as the hardier European varieties are planted at increasingly higher latitudes, especially in the Otago region. There are currently over 25,000 hectares (61,775 acres) of planted vines producing 76 million liters of wine a year.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Sauvignon blanc,</b> particularly from Marlborough, is the country\'s most widely planted varietal. It\'s noted for tropical-fruit characters such as passion fruit and pineapple.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Chardonnay</b> grows well all over the country. Left to its own devices, it has a citric, melonlike flavor, but wood-aging provides spiciness. It\'s the third-most-planted vine in New Zealand; chardonnays from the Nelson region are very good.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Riesling</b> is a gentle variety, with a floral, lightly scented bouquet and fruity taste. Most local versions have at least a touch of sweetness. Ninety percent of the country\'s Rieslings are produced in the South Island.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Gewürztraminer</b> is the most distinctive grape variety, with a superspicy bouquet reminiscent of rose petals, lychees, and spices. Many of the best Kiwi examples come from Gisborne, but a couple of exceptional versions have come out of Hawke\'s Bay, Marlborough, and Martinborough.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Pinot gris</b> is an up-and-comer in New Zealand. At its best, it produces wine with delightfully grainy character and loads of honest flavor. Marlborough growers see a lot of potential in this thin-skinned variety.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Cabernet sauvignon</b> is suited to warmer parts of New Zealand.

Aspiring national parks to form a sweeping World Heritage Area of more than 5 million acres, including some of the best examples of the plants and animals once found on the ancient Gondwanaland supercontinent. It\'s a place of extremes, including the extreme precipitation at the top of Westland. Up to 300 inches of snow per annum falls here, feeding Westland\'s glacier field. The snow is compressed into ice on the névé, or head, of the glaciers (New Zealanders say \"glassy-urs\"), then flows downhill under its own weight. There are more than 60 glaciers in the park; the most famous and accessible are at Franz Josef and Fox. If you\'re driving through on a cloudy or wet day you will get no idea of the size of the mountain ranges just a few miles off the road. On a clear day take a moment to stop and admire them disappearing inland, layer after mighty layer. The Harihari, Whataroa, and Fox Glacier valleys are good for this.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Fox Glacier</b> is slightly larger than Franz Josef, but you\'ll miss nothing important if you see only one. Both glaciers have separate villages, and if you are spending the night, <b>Franz Josef Glacier</b> is marginally preferable. (Both towns have solid tourist infrastructures, but the summer tourist rush means you should make reservations in advance for lodgings and restaurants.) There are parking areas outside both towns from which you can walk 20-40 minutes to reach viewing points of the glaciers. Both parking lots are visited by mischievous kea (<i>kee</i>-ah)—mountain parrots—that may delight in destroying the rubber molding around car windows and eating left-open lunches. Their beaks are like can openers. <i>Kea</i> are harmless to humans, but don\'t feed them. Trails from the parking lots wind across the rocky valley floor to the glacier faces, where a tormented chorus of squeaks, creaks, groans, and gurgles can be heard as the glacier creeps down the mountainside at an average rate of up to 3 feet per day. Care must be taken because rocks and chunks of ice frequently drop from the melting face.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">These being New Zealand glaciers, there is much to do besides admire them. You can fly over them in helicopters or planes and land on the stable névé, or hike on them with guides. Remember that these structures are always in motion—an ice cave that was visible yesterday might today be smashed under tons of ice that used to be just uphill of it. Likewise, some of the fascinating formations that you see on the surface of the glacier were fairly recently at the very bottom of it higher up in the valley. Danger comes with this unstable territory; guides know the hazardous areas to avoid.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For the most part, flights are best early in the morning, when visibility tends to be clearest. Seasonal variables around the glaciers are a surprising thing. Summer may be warmer and by far the busiest season, but there is a lot more rain and fog that can scuttle \"flightseeing\" and hiking plans. There\'s a lot to be said for winter visits. In winter, snow doesn\'t fall at sea level in Franz Josef or Fox; in fact, in winter this area is a lot warmer than the snow towns farther south. Skies are clearer, which means fewer canceled flights and glacier hikes and more spectacular mountains views. Warm clothing is always essential on the glaciers, and evenings can be cold any time of year.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Outside the town of Fox Glacier, <b>Lake Matheson</b> has one of the country\'s most famous views. A walking trail winds along the lakeshore, and the snowcapped peaks of Aoraki/Mt. Cook and Mt. Tasman are reflected in the water. Allow at least three hours for the complete walk from town to the \"view of views\" and back. The best times are sunrise and sunset, when the mirrorlike reflections are less likely to be fractured by the wind. From town, walk down Cook Flat Road toward the sea where a sign points to Gillespies Beach; turn right to reach the lake.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Lake Moeraki</b> is in the midst of Westland National Park, 90 km (56 mi) south of Fox Glacier. There isn\'t a town here; it\'s the site of a thoughtfully designed wilderness lodge (sister lodge to the Arthur\'s Pass Wilderness Lodge. Access to the coast is easiest at <b>Monro Beach.</b> The 45-minute walk to the beach takes you through spectacular, fern-filled native forest to a truly remarkable beach: rock clusters jut out of incredibly blue waters, and rivers and streams flow over the sand into the Tasman Sea. You might arrive at a time when spunky little fiordland crested penguins are in transit from the sea to their stream or hillside nests. Early morning and late afternoon provide the best chance of seeing them.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Two kilometers (1 mi) south of the trail entrance on the beach is a seal colony, which you will smell before you see it. If you venture that way, be sure to keep about 30 feet away from the seals, and don\'t block their path to the sea. A spooked seal will bowl you over on its lurch for the water. Sculpted dark gray rocks also litter the beach to the south, and seals like to lie behind and among them, so look carefully before you cross in front of these rocks.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Monro Beach is an utter dream, not least if you collect driftwood or rocks. On the road 2 km (1 mi) or so south of it, there is a lookout over the rock stacks at <b>Knights Point.</b> Farther south still, between Moeraki and Haast, the walkways and beach at <b>Ship Creek</b> are another stop for ferny forests and rugged coastline. Sandflies here can be voracious, so bring insect repellent and hope for a windy day. (There are far fewer sandflies in winter.) </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Herzog</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Therese and Hans Herzog produce a superb range of wines off their pesticide- and chemical-free vineyard. Pinot gris, pinot noir, and what may be the area\'s only montepulciano are standouts, along with their wonderful merlot-cabernet, aptly named \"The Spirit of Marlborough.\" The tasting area invites you to spend a long sunny afternoon exploring the delights of the cellar.

The area is very peaceful and unspoiled, since day-trippers and picnickers prefer to continue on to neighboring Murud. There are two quiet hotels here that are perfect for spending a few days soaking in the sun and tranquility.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Prakruti Hermitage Resort</b> (Kashid Beach, PO Nandgaon, District Raigad. tel. 22/2404-2501 in Mumbai) is set in the hillside across the road from the beach. Its cottages, with colorful roofs, are large, comfortable, and tastefully furnished. They offer a view of the ocean from the hillside. The cottages are designed for groups—two or three couples on vacation together—and the living room area is common. Rooms are around Rs. 3,000, and no credit cards are accepted.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Kashid Beach Resort</b> (Kashid Beach, Taluka Murud, District Raigad. tel. 21/4427-8501 or 21/4427-8502) is at the top of a hill in a grove of coconut palms. KBR, as it\'s called, is not as upmarket as Prakruti, but it\'s much more authentic. The main hotel building is a row of identical rooms that extends up the hillside. Each room has its own veranda and a garden patio. Opt for the higher rooms—they have a better view of the sea. You can get some fresh seafood at the restaurant cooked in the local style. Book in advance: the hotel fills up on the weekends. Rooms cost around Rs. 3,000; credit cards are not accepted.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Matheran</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The main attraction of this tiny town is the fact that it is car-free. Motorized vehicles of any variety are not allowed to enter Matheran: the main forms of transport are horses, hand-pulled rickshaws, and carts. Over the years this hill station has grown from a tiny hamlet to a tourist resort for budget Maharashtrian tourists. Riding horseback on the country paths beyond the town is a pleasant and popular pastime. Matheran is famed for its handmade shoes and stalls and stalls of footwear dot the town. Equally famous is its toy train.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Lords Central</b> (tel. 2148/230-228; 22/2610-6978; 22/3296-8614 in Mumbai. matheranhotels.com) hasn\'t changed much in 20 years... thankfully. The late Jimmy Lord, a crusty Parsi gentleman who established this Raj-style hotel, was responsible for Matheran\'s drive to hang onto its heritage: he was at the forefront of campaigns to keep the hill station free of vehicles. The old-fashioned rooms here have antique furniture, tiled floors, and verandas. Request for a room in the old wing.

Now a classy hotel run by the professional Neemrana group, the hotel has charm. Sweeping verandas, lounges stuffed with traditional furniture, and spacious bedrooms with heavy beds take you back to the days when British collector Hugh Malet founded this hill station. Rooms start at around Rs. 2,000.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dawn at the Docks in Colaba</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mumbai\'s budget-tourist district is often packed with vacationing Arabs in the rainy season and Western backpackers in the winter. Cheap boardinghouses, handicraft stalls, and eating places stand cheek-by-jowl on the southern tip of Mumbai\'s peninsula.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of Colaba\'s most interesting sights is its fishing dock, built back in 1875. Extraordinarily smelly, mucky, and noisy, <b>Sassoon Dock,</b> on Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg, near the Colaba Bus Station, must be seen at dawn, when most of Mumbai\'s seafood catch is unloaded. Piles of pink prawns are sorted, and grisly looking fish are topped and tailed. The odor is severe, but you won\'t see this kind of chaos and color anywhere else. Out toward the ocean, the famously stinky Bombay duck, actually a fish unique to this coastline, dries on rack after rack in the sun.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Walk north for about 10 minutes toward Navy Nagar (the naval cantonment area) on Shahid Bhagat Singh Marg. Just beyond Colaba Post Office is the old <b>Afghan Memorial Church of St. John the Baptist.</b> Rather out of place in the heart of Colaba, this somewhat imposing structure honors British soldiers lost in the Afghan wars of the late 19th century. The plaques inside say things like, In the memory of Captain Conville Warneford of the Bombay Political Dept and the Gurkha Rifles who was born 13th October 1871 and was treacherously murdered by an Arab at Amrija in the Aden hinterland... If the church doors are closed look for the caretaker, who lives at the side of the church, in the church enclosure, and ask him to show you the church; give him a small something for his trouble.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the church, retrace your steps on Shahid Bhagat Singh as far as the fork outside Colaba Post Office; on foot, take Wodehouse Road up to Panday Road, then turn left there. You\'ll see Capt. Prakash Petha Marg—take another left there, walk for five minutes (past the Taj President hotel), and just beyond the Colaba Woods (park) on your right on Cuffe Parade is a <b>dhobi ghat,</b> behind a facade of huts. (If you get lost, ask a local for help.) Another fascinating open-air sight, the <i>ghat</i> consists of a square half-kilometer of cement stalls where <i>dhobis,</i> or washermen, pound their garments to what seems like pulp to get them threadbare-clean. Rows of racks flutter with drying laundry, and in little huts nearby the incorrigibly dirty stuff is boiled with caustic soda.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Ajanta was ideal—peaceful and remote, with a spectacular setting. It is a steep, wide, horseshoe-shaped gorge above a wild mountain stream flowing through a lush jungle below. The monks began carving caves into the greyrock face of the gorge, and a new temple form was born.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Over the course of seven centuries, the cave temples of Ajanta evolved into works of incredible art. Structural engineers continue to be awestruck by the sheer brilliance of the ancient builders, who, undaunted by the limitations of their implements, materials, and skills, created a marvel of artistic and architectural splendor. In all, 29 caves were carved, 15 of which were left unfinished; some of them were <i>viharas</i> (monasteries)—complete with stone pillows carved onto the monks\' stone beds—others were <i>chaityas</i> (Buddhist cathedrals). All of the caves were profusely decorated with intricate sculptures and murals depicting the many incarnations of Buddha.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As the influence of Buddhism declined, monk-artists were fewer, and the temples were swallowed up by the voracious jungle. About a thousand years later, in 1819, Englishman John Smith was tiger-hunting on the bluff overlooking the Waghora River in the dry season and noticed the soaring arch of what is now dubbed Cave 10 peeking out from the thinned greenery in the ravine below; it was he who subsequently unveiled the caves to the modern world. Incidentally, tigers are not too far from this area (the thick forests from Ajanta to Kannad are the Gautala wildlife sanctuary). Today the caves at Ajanta and Ellora have been listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At both Ajanta and Ellora, monumental facades and statues were chipped out of solid rock, but at Ajanta, an added dimension has survived the centuries—India\'s most remarkable cave paintings. Monks spread a carefully prepared plaster of clay, cow dung, chopped rice husks, and lime onto the rough rock walls, and painted pictures on the walls with local pigments: red ocher, burnt brick, copper oxide, lampblack, and dust from crushed green rocks. The caves are now like chapters of a splendid epic in visual form, recalling the life of the Buddha, and illustrating tales from Buddhist <i>jatakas</i> (fables). As the artists told the story of the Buddha, they portrayed the life and civilization they knew—a drama of ancient nobles, wise men, and commoners.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Opinions vary on which of the Ajanta caves is most exquisite: Caves 1, 2, 16, 17, and 19 are generally considered to have the best paintings; caves 1, 6, 10, 17, 19, and 26 the best sculptures. (The caves are numbered from west to east, not in chronological order.) Try to see all eight of these caves, at least. If you\'re not sightseeing with a guide, ask one of the attendants at each cave for help and tip them ten rupees for their kindness; keep some loose change with you.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most popular at Ajanta are the paintings in <b>Cave 1.</b> These depict the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara and Bodhisattva Padmapani. Padmapani, or the \"one with the lotus in his hand,\" is considered to be the alter ego of the Lord Buddha; Padmapani assumed the duties of the Buddha when he disappeared. Padmapani is depicted with his voluptuous wife, one of Ajanta\'s most widely reproduced figures. When seen from different angles, the magnificent Buddha statue in this cave seems to wear different facial expressions.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Cave 2</b> is remarkable for its ceiling decorations and its murals relating the birth of the Buddha. For its sheer exuberance, the painting of women on a swing is considered the finest. It\'s on the right wall as you enter, and when you face the wall it\'s on the left side of it.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Cave 6</b> is a two-story cave with lovely detail. Climb the steep steps to the second floor. Here there are pillars that emit musical sounds when rapped. On the first floor is an interesting well/undergound tank just outside the cave.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The oldest cave is <b>Cave 10,</b> a chaitya dating from 200 BC, filled with Buddhas and dominated by an enormous <i>stupa</i> (a dome, or monument, to Buddha). It\'s only in AD 100, however, that the exquisite brush-and-line work begins. In breathtaking detail, the Shadanta Jataka, a legend about the Buddha, is depicted on the wall in a continuous panel. There are no idols of Buddha in this cave, indicating that idol worship was not in vogue at the time—but the fact that <b>Cave 19,</b> hardly nine caves later, contains idols of Buddha, shows the progression of thought and the development of new methods of worship as the centuries wore on. Guides and caretakers will enthusiastically point out the name of the Englishman, John Smith, who rediscovered the caves—his name, along with 1819 underneath, is carved on the 12th pillar on the right-hand side of this cave. (Incidentally, Cave 10 was the first cave Smith spotted because its domed arch made it quite visible from the bluff above.)</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The mystical heights attained by the monk-artists seem to have reached their zenith in <b>Cave 16.</b> Here a continuous narrative spreads both horizontally and vertically, evolving into a panoramic whole—at once logical and stunning. One painting here is riveting: known as <i>The Dying Princess,</i> it\'s believed to represent Sundari, the wife of the Buddha\'s half-brother Nanda, who left her to become a monk. Cave 16 has an excellent view of the river and may have been the entrance to the entire series of caves.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Cave 17</b> holds the greatest number of pictures undamaged by time. Luscious heavenly damsels fly effortlessly overhead, a prince makes love to a princess, and the Buddha tames a raging elephant. (Resisting temptation is a theme.) Other favorite paintings include the scene of a woman applying lipstick and one of a princess performing <i>sringar</i> (her toilette). This cameo is on the right hand wall as you enter and as you face the wall on the farthest right pillar.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Cave 26</b> is the more interesting of the caves on the far end. An impressive sculpted panel of a reclining Buddha is on your left as you enter. it\'s apparently a portrayal of a dying Buddha on the verge of attaining nirvana. His weeping followers are at his side, while celestial beings are waiting to transport him to the land of no tomorrows or rebirths.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A number of unfinished caves were abandoned mysteriously, but even these are worth a visit if you can haul yourself up a steep 100 steps. You can also walk up the bridle path, a gentler ascent in the form of a crescent pathway alongside the caves; from here you have a magnificent view of the ravine descending into the Waghura River. There\'s a much easier way to reach this point. On your return by car to Aurangabad, 20 km (12 mi) from the caves, take a right at Balapur and head 8 km (5 mi) toward Viewpoint, as it\'s called by the locals.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A trip to the Ajanta caves needs to be well planned. You can see the caves at a fairly leisurely pace in two hours, but the drive to and from the caves takes anywhere from two to three hours. Come prepared with water, lunch or snacks (from a shop in Aurangabad, because you won\'t get that much here except packed items like potato chips at the visitor center, and nothing once you enter the caves), comfortable walking shoes (that can be slipped on and off easily, because shoes are not allowed inside the caves), socks to pad about the cave in and not get your feet dirty, a small flashlight, a hat or umbrella for the heat, and patience. Aurangabad can be hot year-round, and touring 29 caves tiring. The paintings are dimly lit to protect the artwork, and a number are badly damaged, so deciphering the work takes some effort. But the archaeological department has put a lot of effort into making the caves more viewable, including special ultraviolet lights to brighten up certain panels. Shades and nets installed at the mouth of each cave keep out excess sun and bats.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There\'s no longer direct access to the caves. All visitors are required to park their cars or disembark from their coaches at a visitor center 3 km (2 mi) from the caves. A Rs. 6 ticket (Rs. 10 for an air-conditioned coach, that go less frequently) buys you a place on frequently departing green Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) coaches going to the caves. Remember to carry the most important (and just enough) possessions with you, because it\'s a long haul back to retrieve snacks, guide books, or hats, or to dump extra belongings. The visitor complex has stalls with people hawking souvenirs, film, sodas, water, and packaged and fresh hot snacks—plus lots of irritating hawkers and unknown guides that need to be assiduously ignored and firmly dismissed.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The caves are connected by a fair number of steps; it\'s best to start at the far end at Cave 26 and work your way back—or you\'ll have a hot trek back at the end. The initial climb up, before you reach the cave level, is also quite a climb at 92 steps. Palanquins carried by helpers are available for the less hardy, for Rs. 400. Flash photography and video cameras are prohibited inside the caves (shooting outside fine), but for an extra Rs. 5 added to your admission fee, lights are turned on in the caves as you enter. Right outside the caves, a shoddy MTDC-run restaurant, predictably called the Ajanta, offers simple refreshments; this is the only refreshment area or stall near the caves.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">MTDC operates a small hotel (25 rooms, 15 with a/c; 2438/244-230) 5 km (3 mi) from the caves, at Fardapur. A cloak room is available at the caves to deposit bags for Rs. 5 per bag. COST: Foreigners US$5, light fee Rs. 5 (includes all caves), video camera fee Rs. 25, parking Rs. 15.

The vast majority of restaurants are happy to accommodate kids with simplified dishes and an out-of-the-way booth. Here are some particularly family-friendly options.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Charley\'s Saloon</b>. Saloons may be no place for kids, but this is no real saloon. Charley\'s doles out American classics (cheeseburgers, steaks, and apple pies) in a fun retro setting. Kids can color and people-watch. 284 Newbury St., Back Bay, 02115. tel. 617/266-3000. <b>Full Moon</b>. Kids will delight in the play kitchen and dollhouse, and parents can cheer that they get to tuck into lovelies such as grilled salmon with sautéed spinach. Meanwhile there\'s plenty of macaroni and cheese or quesadillas for the young ones. 344 Huron Ave., Cambridge, 02138. tel. 617/354-6699. <b>Joe\'s American Bar &amp; Grille</b>. So what if the restaurant looks as if it has been decorated by a raving mob at a July 4 parade? Next to an oversize burger and a slice of apple pie, the red, white, and blue overload is kind of fun. The clam chowder is almost always a hit with all generations. 279 Dartmouth St., Back Bay, 02116. tel. 617/536-4200. <b>Kingfish Hall</b>.

During the day the monument seems at odds with the 18th-century streetscape of Blackstone Square behind it. Shoehorned into the north end of Union Park, the Holocaust Memorial is the work of Stanley Saitowitz, whose design was selected through an international competition; the finished memorial was dedicated in 1995. Recollections by Holocaust survivors are set into the glass-and-granite walls; the upper levels of the towers are etched with 6 million numbers in random sequence, symbolizing the Jewish victims of the Nazi horror. Manufactured steam from grates in the granite base makes for a particularly haunting scene after dark. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Institute of Contemporary Art</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Housed in a breathtaking cantilevered edifice that juts out over the Boston waterfront, the ICA moved to this site in 2006 as part of a massive reinvention that\'s seeing the museum grow into one of Boston\'s most exciting attractions. Since its foundation in 1936, the institute has cultivated its cutting-edge status: it\'s played host to works by Edvard Munch, Egon Schiele, and Oskar Kokoschka. Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, and Roy Lichtenstein each mounted pivotal exhibitions here early in their careers. Now the ICA is building a major permanent collection for the first time in its history while continuing to showcase innovative paintings, videos, installations, and multimedia shows. The performing arts get their due in the museum\'s new theater, and the Water Café features cuisine from Wolfgang Puck. www.icaboston.org. COST: $12, free Thurs. 5-9, free for families last Sat. of every month. OPEN: Tues. and Wed. 10-5, Thurs. and Fri. 10-9, weekends 10-5. Tours on select weekends at 2 and select Thurs. at 6. Metro: Courthouse. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fenway Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For 86 years, the Boston Red Sox suffered a World Series dry spell, a streak of bad luck that fans attributed to the \"Curse of the Bambino,\" which, stories have it, struck the team in 1920 when they sold Babe Ruth (the \"Bambino\") to the New York Yankees. All that changed in 2004, when a maverick squad—including local heroes Jason Varitek, Kevin Youkilis, and particular favorite David Ortiz—broke the curse in a thrilling seven-game series against the team\'s nemesis in the Series semifinals. This win against the Yankees was followed by a four-game sweep of St. Louis in the finals. Boston, and its citizens\' ingrained sense of pessimism, hasn\'t been the same since. The repeat World Series win in 2007 has just cemented Bostonians\' sense that the universe is finally working correctly. There\'s a palpable sense of justice being served, and more than a little pride in the way Red Sox caps have become residents\' semiofficial uniform.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fenway may be one of the smallest parks in the major leagues (capacity almost 39,000), but it\'s one of the most beloved, despite its oddball dimensions and the looming left-field wall, otherwise known as the Green Monster. Parking is expensive and the seats are a bit cramped, but the air is thick with legend. Ruth pitched here when the stadium was new; Ted Williams and Carl Yastrzemski slugged out their entire careers here. www.boston.redsox.mlb.com. COST: Tours $12. OPEN: Tours Mon.-Sat. 9-4, Sun. 9-3; on game days, last tour is 3 hrs before game time.

Occupying a compound of buildings north of Massachusetts General, the museum sits astride the Charles River Dam. More than 550 exhibits cover astronomy, astrophysics, anthropology, progress in medicine, computers, the organic and inorganic earth sciences, and much more. The emphasis is on hands-on education. For instance, at the \"Investigate!\" exhibit children explore such scientific principles as gravity by balancing objects—there are no wrong answers here, only discoveries. Children can learn the physics behind everyday play activities such as swinging and bumping up and down on a teeter-totter in the \"Science in the Park\" exhibit. Other displays include \"Light House,\" where you can experiment with color and light, and the perennial favorite,\"Dinosaurs: Modeling the Mesozoic,\" which lets kids become paleontologists and examine dinosaur bones, fossils, and tracks.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Charles Hayden Planetarium</b> (tel. 617/723-2500), with its sophisticated multimedia system based on a Zeiss planetarium projector, produces exciting programs on astronomical discoveries. Laser light shows, with laser graphics and computer animation, are scheduled Thursday through Sunday evenings. The shows are best for children older than five. Admission to the planetarium is $4 if you paid the admission for the museum and $9 for the planetarium alone. The Museum of Science includes the <b>Mugar Omni Theater</b> (tel. 617/723-2500), a five-story dome screen. The theater\'s state-of-the-art sound system provides extra-sharp acoustics, and the huge projection allows the audience to practically experience the action on-screen. Try to get tickets in advance online or over the phone. Admission for shows is $9 (or $4 if you paid the admission for the museum). Call or check the museum\'s Web site for showtimes. Although the museum is usually viewed as a family destination, a more-adult crowd appears on Friday nights from 6 to 10 for the <b>Science Street Café,</b> where you can sip a martini and enjoy better-than-usual museum food to the sounds of live music. Afterward, stroll through near-empty exhibit halls for a late viewing or climb up to the Gilliland Observatory for a romantic up-close glimpse of the nighttime sky. www.mos.org. COST: $19. OPEN: July 5-Labor Day, Sat.-Thurs. 9-7, Fri. 9-9; After Labor Day-July 4, Sat.-Thurs. 9-5, Fri. 9-9. Metro: Science Park. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museum of Fine Arts</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Count on staying awhile if you have any hope of even beginning to see what\'s here. Eclecticism and thoroughness, often an incompatible pair, have coexisted agreeably at the MFA since its earliest days. From Renaissance and baroque masters to impressionist marvels to African masks to sublime samples of Native American pottery and contemporary crafts, the collections are happily shorn of both cultural snobbery and shortsighted trendiness.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Founded in 1870, the MFA first resided on the upper floors of the Boston Athenaeum, then a Gothic structure on the site where the Copley Plaza Hotel now stands. As the museum was beginning to outgrow that space, the Fenway area was becoming fashionable, and in 1909 the move was made to Guy Lowell\'s somewhat severe beaux arts building, to which the West Wing, designed by I. M. Pei, was added in 1981. The move helped cap the half century of expansion of the Back Bay area.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The MFA\'s collection of approximately 450,000 objects was built from a core of paintings and sculpture from the Boston Athenaeum, historical portraits from the city of Boston, and donations by area universities. The early MFA connoisseurs were as enamored as any cultured Victorians with the great art of European civilizations. Nevertheless, they sought out American works as well; today, the museum\'s holdings of American art—supplemented by intensive acquisitions in the early 1990s—surpass those of all but two or three U.S. museums. The MFA has more than 60 works by John Singleton Copley; major paintings by Winslow Homer, John Singer Sargent, Fitz Hugh Lane, and Edward Hopper; and a wealth of American works ranging from native New England folk art and colonial portraiture to New York abstract expressionism of the 1950s and 1960s. Also of particular note are the John Singer Sargent paintings adorning the Rotunda. They were specially commissioned for the museum in 1921 and make for a dazzling first impression on visitors coming through the Huntington Street entrance.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">American decorative arts are also liberally represented, particularly those of New England in the years before the Civil War. Rooms of period furniture show the progression of taste from the earliest Pilgrim pieces through the 18th-century triumphs of the Queen Anne, Hepplewhite, Sheraton, and Empire styles. Native son Paul Revere, much more than a sounder of alarms, is amply represented as well, with superb silver teapots, sauceboats, and other tableware.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The museum also owns one of the world\'s most extensive collections of Asian art under one roof. Its Japanese art collection is the finest outside Japan, and Chinese porcelains of the Tang Dynasty are especially well represented. The Egyptian rooms display statuary, furniture, and exquisite gold jewelry; a special funerary-arts gallery exhibits coffins, mummies, and burial treasures. The gathering of classical treasures, including marble busts, jewelry, and glassware, proceeds chronologically from the Cycladic period through the Roman era.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">French impressionists abound and are perhaps more comprehensively displayed here than at any other new-world museum outside the Art Institute of Chicago; many of the 38 Monets (the largest collection of his work outside France) vibrate with color. There are canvases by Renoir, Pissarro, Manet, and the American painters Mary Cassatt and Childe Hassam.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Three important galleries explore the art of Africa, Oceania, and the Ancient Americas, expanding the MFA\'s emphasis on civilizations outside the Western tradition. Highlights include rare examples of the earliest-known figurative sculpture from sub-Saharan Africa, expressive Melanesian works in wood and stone, delicate Olmec jade sculptures, and extraordinary Maya painted ceramics.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The museum has strong collections of textiles, costumes, and prints dating from the 15th century, including many works by Dürer and Goya, and its collection of antique musical instruments is among the finest in the world.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fifteen second-floor galleries contain the MFA\'s European painting and sculpture collection, dating from the 11th century to the 20th. Among the standouts are Donatello\'s marble relief <i>The Madonna of the Clouds</i> and J. M. W. Turner\'s powerful work <i>The Slave Ship.</i> Most striking, however, is the <b>William I. Koch Gallery,</b> a former tapestry room whose 40-foot-high marble walls are now hung, nearly floor to ceiling, with 53 dramatic Renaissance and baroque paintings by El Greco, Claude Lorraine, Poussin, Rubens, Tintoretto, Titian, Van Dyck, Velázquez, Veronese, and other masters.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>West Wing,</b> an airy, well-lighted space, is used primarily to mount special exhibitions, temporary shows drawn from the museum\'s holdings, and lively contemporary-art and photography exhibits. It also has the Bravo Restaurant, a cafeteria, and a café serving light snacks. From October to April, tea is served from 2:30 to 4 in the second-floor Upper Rotunda, and the year-round cocktail party \"MFA Fridays,\" from 5:30 to 9:30—held weekly in summer and monthly at other times—has become quite the social event. The MFA\'s Film Program brings new and classic art-house cinema to the museum\'s theater, often in conjunction with talks with filmmakers. Annual events such as the Boston French Film Festival and the Boston Jewish Film Festival are also held here. Kids can keep busy with workshops (Tuesday-Sunday) and special programs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 2005, the museum broke ground on a massive construction project that the trustees hope will keep it in America\'s cultural vanguard for the next 100 years. In its first phase, a new <b>East Wing</b> will be built to house the Art of the Americas collection, expanding the current gallery space by 50%. The contemporary and 20th-century art collections will move to the Gund Gallery, currently housing temporary exhibitions, and a new special-exhibition space will be built beneath the East Courtyard. Other aspects of the 133-year-old building\'s enormous face-lift will include a new glass-enclosed courtyard, the reopening of the Fenway entrance, and a \"crystal spine\" to run the full length of the museum. The new American Wing is expected to open in November 2010; the museum will remain open during construction. www.mfa.org. COST: $17; by donation Wed. 4-9:45.

Metro: Museum. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Emerald Necklace</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The six large public parks known as Boston\'s Emerald Necklace stretch 5 mi from the Back Bay Fens through Franklin Park, in Dorchester. Frederick Law Olmsted\'s design heightened the natural beauty of the Emerald Necklace, which remains a well-groomed urban masterpiece. Locals take pride in and happily make use of its open spaces and its pathways and bridges connecting rivers and ponds. The <b>Emerald Necklace Conservancy</b> (tel. 617/522-2700. www.emeraldnecklace.org) maintains a regular calendar of nature walks and other events in the parks. Rangers with the <b>Boston Parks &amp; Recreation Department</b> (1010 Massachusetts Ave., 02118. tel. 617/635-4505. www.cityofboston.gov/parks/parkrangers) lead tours highlighting the area\'s historic sites and surprising ecological diversity. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Boston Common</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nothing is more central to Boston than the Common, the oldest public park in the United States and undoubtedly the largest and most famous of the town commons around which New England settlements were traditionally arranged. Boston Common is not built on landfill like the adjacent Public Garden, nor is it the result of 19th-century park planning, as are Frederick Law Olmsted\'s Fens and Franklin Park; it started as 50 acres where the freemen of Boston could graze their cattle. (Cows were banned in 1830.) Dating from 1634, it\'s as old as the city around it. Latin names are affixed to many of the Common\'s trees; it was once expected that proper Boston schoolchildren be able to translate them.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Central Burying Ground</b> (Boylston St. near Tremont, 02116. Park St.) may seem an odd feature for a public park, but remember that in 1756, when the land was set aside, this was a lonely corner of the Common. It\'s the final resting place of Tories and Patriots alike, as well as many British casualties of the Battle of Bunker Hill. The most famous person buried here is Gilbert Stuart, the portraitist best known for his likenesses of George and Martha Washington; he died a poor man in 1828. The Burying Ground is open daily 9-5. On Tremont Street near Boylston stands the 1888 <b>Boston Massacre Memorial</b>; the sculpted hand of one of the victims has a distinct shine from years of sightseers\' caresses. The Common\'s highest ground, near the park\'s Parkman Bandstand, was once called Flagstaff Hill. It\'s now surmounted by the <b>Soldiers and Sailors Monument,</b> honoring Civil War troops. The Common\'s only body of water is the <b>Frog Pond,</b> a tame and frog-free concrete depression used as a children\'s wading pool during steamy summer days and for ice-skating in winter. It marks the original site of a natural pond that inspired Edgar Allan Poe to call Bostonians \"Frogpondians.\" In 1848 a gushing fountain of piped-in water was created to inaugurate Boston\'s municipal water system.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the Beacon Street side of the Common sits the splendidly restored <b>Robert Gould Shaw 54th Regiment Memorial,</b> executed in deep-relief bronze by Augustus Saint-Gaudens in 1897. It commemorates the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first Civil War unit made up of free blacks, led by the young Brahmin Robert Gould Shaw. He and half of his troops died in an assault on South Carolina\'s Fort Wagner; their story inspired the 1989 movie <i>Glory.</i> The monument—first intended to depict only Shaw until his abolitionist family demanded it honor his regiment as well—figures in works by the poets John Berryman and Robert Lowell, both of whom lived on the north slope of Beacon Hill in the 1940s. In Lowell\'s moving poem \"For the Union Dead\" he writes,\"at the dedication, William James could almost hear the bronze Negroes breathe.\" This magnificent memorial makes a fitting first stop on the Black Heritage Trail. Metro: Park St. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Boston Harbor Islands National Park Area</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Comprising 34 islands, the Boston Harbor Islands National Park Area is somewhat of a hidden gem for nature lovers and history buffs, with miles of lightly traveled trails and shoreline and several little-visited historic sites to explore. The focal point of the national park is 39-acre Georges Island, where you\'ll find the partially restored pre-Civil War Fort Warren that once held Confederate prisoners. Other islands worth visiting include Peddocks Island, which holds the remains of Fort Andrews, and Lovells Island, a popular destination for campers. Lovells, Peddocks, Grape, and Bumpkin islands allow camping with a permit from late June through Labor Day. There are swimming areas at the four camping-friendly islands as well, but only Lovells has lifeguards. Pets and alcohol are not allowed on the Harbor Islands. The <b>National Park Service</b> (tel. 617/223-8666. www.bostonislands.com) is a good source for information about camping, transportation, and the like. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The idea of moving the capital to the countryside was first voiced in the 18th century, allegedly by the Portuguese Marquis of Pombal. Several sites were proposed, in different central states. A team was commissioned to study the climatic conditions of inland Brazil and demarcate an area for the future capital. The team\'s final report was submitted in 1894, but it wasn\'t until 1946 that the plan of moving the capital to the Central Plateau became a reality with the advent of a new Constitution. President Juscelino Kubitschek ordered the construction of Brasília in 1956.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The mystic part of the history of Brasília revolves around bishop Dom Bosco and the prophetic dream he had in the 19th century, 75 years before the construction of the city. Dom Bosco dreamed about Brasília being the \"promised land, flowing with milk and honey and inconceivable riches\" between parallels 15 and 20. Dom Bosco\'s dream was used as one of the mottos to justify the moving of the capital to the interior of the country.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Brasília was unveiled in 1960. In 1987 UNESCO declared the city a World Heritage Site. Since its founding, Brasília has seen important political and social changes, such as the enactment of the current Brazilian Constitution in 1988 (the first after the military dictatorship stepped down) and rallies against President Fernando Collor de Mello, the only Brazilian president to be impeached, in 1992.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Brazilian Savanna</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Brazil\'s vast <i>cerrado</i> (savanna) is the most biologically rich grassland in the world. More than 100,000 species of plants are found in this 500-million-acre (200-million-hectare) territory that covers about 25% of Brazil, and nearly 50% of them are endemic to Brazil. Its small trees, shrubs, and grasses are adapted to the harshness of the dry season, when temperatures in some parts rise well above 38°C (100°F) and humidity drops to a desert low of 13%. Palm species usually stand out among the shrubby vegetation—thick bunches of <i>buriti</i> usually grow around springs and creeks. Cacti and bromeliads are also abundant. Look also for the <i>pequi,</i> a shrub that produces berries used in local cuisine, which are called souari nuts.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Unfortunately, only about 2% of the cerrado is protected. Since development—mostly in the form of soy and corn farming and cattle ranches—it has become harder to spot such species of cerrado wildlife as deer, jaguars, and giant anteaters. Emus, however, can be seen wandering through pastures and soybean plantations.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Making of a Capital</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As far back as 1808 Brazilian newspapers ran articles discussing Rio\'s inadequacies as a capital (Rio became the capital in 1763, following Brazil\'s first capital, Salvador), the argument being that contact with Pará and other states far from Rio was difficult. Also, Rio was right on the water, and an easy target for enemy invasion. In 1892 congress authorized an overland expedition to find a central locale where \"a city could be constructed next to the headwaters of big rivers\" and where \"roads could be opened to all seaports.\" Within three months the expedition leaders had chosen a plateau in the southeastern Goiás region.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">But it was not until the mid-1950s that Juscelino Kubitschek made the new capital part of his presidential campaign agenda, which was summarized in the motto \"Fifty Years in Five.\" When he was elected in 1956, he quickly set the wheels in motion. Within a few days the site was selected (in Goiás, as proposed by the 1892 expedition), work committees were set up, and Niemeyer was put in charge of architectural and urban development. The design, called the Plano Piloto (Pilot, or Master, Plan), was the work of Lúcio Costa, chosen from an international contest. The concept was simple and original: \"Brasília was conceived by the gesture of those who mark a place on a map: two axes intersecting at a right angle, that is, the sign of a cross mark.\" The Plano Piloto\'s most important gardens were to be created by famed landscape designer Roberto Burle Marx.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Among Costa\'s objectives were to do away with a central downtown, design highways that were as accident-free as possible, and ensure that the vast horizon would always be visible. Construction officially began in February 1957—with 3,000 workers on-site.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Building a modern seat of power for Latin America\'s largest nation was a monumental undertaking. Before paved roads were built, supplies had to be flown in from the eastern cities. The majority of the workers were immigrants from the Northeast, and unskilled. They learned fast and worked hard, however. Settlements of shacks and tents sprang up around the construction site. The largest, Freetown (now the suburb Nucleo Bandeirante), was home to close to 15,000 workers and their families.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In Rio, opposition to the new capital was heated. Debates in the senate turned into fistfights. Government employees feared that Rio\'s business would decline and its real-estate values would drop, and were reluctant to leave Rio\'s comforts and beaches. Kubitschek\'s government induced them with 100% salary increases, tax breaks, early retirement options, ridiculously low rents, and even discounts on home furnishings.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On April 21, 1960, the city was inaugurated. The day began with mass in the uncompleted cathedral and ended with a fireworks display, where the president\'s name burned in 15-foot-high letters. A new era of pioneering and colonization followed the realization of Kubitschek\'s vision of a \"nation of the future,\" looking westward from the coast.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Large panes of stained glass supported by the concrete structure shelter the nave, leaving it awash in natural light. Inside, <i>Os Anjos</i> (<i>The Angels</i>)—an aluminum sculpture by Brazilian artist Alfredo Ceschiatti—hovers above the altar. The city\'s first mass was held at the Praça do Cruzeiro, on May 3, 1957; the <i>cruz</i> (cross) used is now here at the cathedral.

In contrast to the turbulent colonial past experienced by neighboring islands, which included repeated conflicts between France and Britain for dominance and control, British rule in Barbados carried on uninterrupted for 340 years—from the first established British settlement in 1627 until independence was granted in 1966. That\'s not to say, of course, that there weren\'t significant struggles in Barbados, as elsewhere in the Caribbean, between the British landowners and their African-born slaves and other indentured servants.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With that unfortunate period of slavery relegated to the history books, the British influence on Barbados remains strong today in local manners, attitudes, customs, and politics—tempered, of course, by the characteristically warm nature of the Bajan people. In keeping with British-born traditions, many Bajans worship at the Anglican church, afternoon tea is a ritual, cricket is the national pastime (a passion, most admit), dressing for dinner is a firmly entrenched tradition, and patrons at some bars are as likely to order a Pimm\'s Cup as a rum and Coke. And yet, Barbados is hardly stuffy—this is still the Caribbean, after all.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tourist facilities are concentrated on the west coast in St. James and St. Peter parishes (appropriately dubbed the Platinum Coast) and on the south coast in Christ Church Parish. Traveling along the west coast to historic Holetown, the site of the first British settlement, and continuing to the northern city of Speightstown, you can find posh beachfront resorts, luxurious private villas, and fine restaurants enveloped by lush gardens and tropical foliage. The trendier, more commercial south coast offers competitively priced hotels and beach resorts, and its St. Lawrence Gap area is jam-packed with shops, restaurants, and nightlife. The relatively wide-open spaces along the southeast coast are proving ripe for development, and some wonderful inns and hotels already take advantage of the intoxicatingly beautiful ocean vistas. For their own holidays, though, Bajans escape to the rugged east coast, where the Atlantic surf pounds the dramatic shoreline with unrelenting force.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">All in all, Barbados is a sophisticated tropical island with a rich history, lodgings to suit every taste and pocketbook, and plenty to pique your interest both day and night—whether you\'re British or not!</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

If you hike among the mangroves, you\'re likely to see an incredible assortment of small creatures that depend on the trees for survival. Most evident are mudskippers and mangrove crabs, but keen observers may spot green-backed herons among mangrove roots.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The prime hiking season is May through September, and the best method is by walking along dry creek beds. Bring plenty of insect repellent. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">WhiteWater World</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Next door to Dreamworld, and under the same management, is the Gold Coast\'s latest thrill-seeking theme park, WhiteWater World. Here, you\'ll find state-of-the-art water rides including the Blue Ringed Octopus (BRO), a convoluted 8-lane racer slide; The Rip—Australia\'s biggest corkscrew-cored whirlpool; an inner-tube \"aquacoaster\" ride packed with serpentine curves, drops, slides, and 360° turns known as the Temple of Huey; and The Green Room, a 20-meter-high \"tube\" simulating the inside of a monster wave. Anklebiters will enjoy Nickelodeon\'s Pipeline Plunge, with 100-plus watery activities. Toddlers can play safely at Wiggle Bay, with its pint-size water slides, water cannons, shade, and supervision.

There\'s even a EUR 15 combo pass to help you do it.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>To Market, To Market.</b> Every day of the week guarantees at least one lively market where stalls sell everything from olives and fruit to antique furniture and dog-eared books.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chocolate Country</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Years ago, visitors to Brussels, stepping out of the Midi train station, would be greeted by the sight of the Côte D\'Or chocolate factory. The plumes of smoke rising from its stacks would scent the air with a seductive aroma of freshly made chocolate. Though the factory closed in the late 1970s, you won\'t lack for reminders of one of the country\'s signature industries. With nearly 500 large- and small-scale chocolatiers vying for a place at the top, Belgian chocolate making is a prodigious and cutthroat business. The domestic market alone is formidable; Belgium has one of the world\'s highest chocolate consumption rates, at an average of more than 15 pounds per person per year.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The country\'s reputation for high quality rests on choice raw materials and meticulous production practices. Belgian companies go after the rare criollo cocoa beans and the trinitario variety (a cross between criollo and the hardier, less subtle forastero cocoa), both of which have complex, nonbitter flavors. The bean roasting and crushing is done with exceptional precision. The best producers conch their chocolate—a refining process of mixing the chocolate with extra cocoa butter or other additions—for days rather than a few hours, as standard manufacturers do. Extended conching creates a smooth, even texture and reduces acid levels, enhancing the chocolate taste.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You can get a full rundown on the production process at the Musée du Cacao et du Chocolat in Brussels. Of course, you should also indulge in a little self-education at some of the local chocolate shops as well.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Belgium\'s chief contribution to the history of chocolate making came in 1912, when Belgian chocolatier Jean Neuhaus created the first <i>pralines,</i> bite-size chocolates filled with a mixture of nuts and sugar. Billed as \"individual masterpieces,\" these handcrafted delicacies proved an excellent way for chocolatiers to distinguish themselves. Neuhaus\'s \"couverture\" chocolate formed a shell that could hold all kinds of fillings: caramels, creams, flavored ganaches, and more. Combining visual elegance with exquisite taste, the praline continues to undergo reinvention by chocolatiers. Classic examples such as gianduja (hazelnut) share display cases with newcomers flavored with ginger, tea, or herbs. Many chocolatiers make seasonal or special-event pralines; and some chocolatiers, such as Pierre Marcolini, are increasingly emphasizing the origins of the cocoa beans, offering chocolates made from beans from a single location, such as Venezuela or Ghana.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">So seriously does Belgium take its reputation as a chocolate producer that in 2000 its Ministry of Economic Affairs created a mark of quality assurance, AMBAO (\"cocoa\" in Swahili). The formation of AMBAO was a quick response to the EU decision earlier that year that ruled that up to 5% of the cocoa butter in chocolate could be replaced by other vegetable fats and the result could still be called chocolate. Members of the AMBAO association, ranging from large international companies to small artisanal producers, use only 100% cocoa butter in their chocolate, and uphold higher overall quality levels than those dictated by the EU bureaucrats.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Moules the Word</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Munching mussels in Brussels is one local Belgian tradition that most visitors don\'t pass up. The national dish is in season from September to February and most of the mussels are swept from the North Sea straight to your plate. Traditionally they are served in a large, steaming, black pot of savory broth, with a portion of Belgian frites and a large dollop of mayonnaise. The broth is usually <i>à la marinere,</i> a tasty sauce of white wine, shallots, parsley, and butter; occasionally the white wine is replaced by Belgian beer. Another common method of serving is à la crème, where the stock is thickened with flour and heavy cream.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Among the many fish restaurants in the maze of little alleyways behind the Grand\'Place, mussels can be found in and out of season. Chez Léon on rue des Bouchers is a favorite for mussels tasting. Tourists and personalities from the world of business, culture, and politics flock to the restaurant to try one of 14 homemade mussels recipes, including the <i>moules speciale,</i> made from a secret casserole recipe.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Aux Armes de Bruxelles, also on rue des Bouchers, is another good option for indulging in mussels. But for those seeking a less-touristy location to enjoy the famous Belgian dish, place Ste-Catherine has a good reputation for delicious fish restaurants. Bij den Boer, on the Quai des Briques next to the square, is a popular treat for locals who rave about its wide range of fish specialities.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

In addition to seeing the more than 1,500 instruments on display, you can listen to them via infrared headphones; you can hear musical extracts from almost every instrument as you stand in front of it. The more than 200 extracts range from ancient Greek tunes to mid-20th century pieces. Paintings and ancient vases depicting the instruments being played throughout history complete the experience. The four-story museum features a complete 17th-century orchestra, a precious 1619 spinet-harpsichord (only two such instruments exist), an armonica, a rare Chedeville bagpipe, and about 100 Indian instruments given to King Leopold II by the rajah Sourindro Mohun Tagore. There\'s a rich selection of European folk instruments, as well as creations by the amazingly prolific Adolphe Sax. In the basement, the Garden of Orpheus is set up for children to discover musical instruments. The site combines one of the city\'s most beautiful Art Nouveau buildings—the former Old England department store, designed by architect Paul Saintenoy in 1899—with the adjoining neoclassical 1913 Barré-Guimard building. A third building in the adjoining rue Villa Hermosa houses the 7,000 instrument reserve. The tearoom and restaurant on the sixth floor offer panoramic views of Brussels. www.mim.fgov.be. COST: EUR 5.

It\'s a vital part of the city—everyone passes through at some point. At night the burnished facades of the guild houses and their gilded statuary look especially dramatic: from April to September, the square is floodlighted after sundown with waves of changing colors, accompanied by music. Try to be here for the <i>Ommegang,</i> a magnificent historical pageant re-creating Emperor Charles V\'s reception in the city in 1549 (the first Tuesday and Thursday in July). You\'ll find here a flower market, frequent jazz and classical concerts, and in December, under the majestic Christmas tree, a life-size crèche with sheep grazing around it.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Built in ornate Baroque style soon after the 1695 bombardment, the square\'s guild houses have a striking architectural coherence. Among the buildings on the north side of the square, Nos. 1-2, <b>Le Roy d\'Espagne,</b> belonged to the bakers\' guild.

But this city has as many \"must-dos\" as \"must-sees.\" So if you want to really experience Hungary\'s capital, plan on spending six days, setting a seventh aside for outbound travel.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 1: Take It from the Top</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There\'s a good reason why Castle Hill is the undisputed first stop on everyone\'s itinerary. This UNESCO World Heritage Site has a genuine \"wow factor,\" yet it is compact enough for jet-lagged—or late-arriving—visitors to cover on their first day. Begin by poking around the Royal Palace (time permitting, tour the Hungarian National Gallery in its center block). Next, stroll along the cobblestone streets between colorful baroque, Gothic, and Renaissance facades, stopping in for a look at Matthias Church; then head for Fishermen\'s Bastion. The view from its Disneyesque turrets isn\'t just achingly beautiful: it will help you get your bearings! If you need a caffeine fix to keep you going—or just want to get a fix on Budapest\'s coffee culture—drop into Ruszwurm, the city\'s oldest café.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 2: On the Boulevard</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Today, turn your back on hilly Buda and get acquainted with blessedly flat Pest. Start with a look inside massive Szent István Bazilika. Views from the cupola are worth the climb; though you may want to save your energy for the walk along Andrássy út, another UNESCO World Heritage Site. En route, pick and choose between the attractions (the Operaház and Terror Háza are favorites), leaving time to ogle other architectural treasures. The boulevard comes to a climatic finish at Hosök tere, where the Millennial Monument is flanked by two more museums. After perusing Old Masters in the Fodor\'s-recommended Szépmuvészeti, take the Millennial Underground back to the opera house for an evening performance. Then wrap things up by toasting the good life with an alfresco nightcap (and some world-class people-watching) on nearby Liszt Ferenc tér.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 3: Playing in Pest</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Time for a little self-indulgence! Kick off your day the Budapest way by breakfasting at Café Gerbeaud on Vörösmarty tér; then spend the morning browsing around Váci utca. Even if shopping\'s not your bag, you\'ll find the street to be a fascinating study in contrasts as it runs south past Euro-style boutiques, through the university area, to the venerable Vásárcsarnok Market. In the afternoon, treat yourself to a tour. Commercial ones cater to almost every taste—and cover almost every mode of transportation, from boats and bikes to balloons. Major sites, like Parliament, also offer tours. Prefer to be independent? Www.budapestinfo.hu outlines self-guided walks relating to subjects like Bauhaus architecture and Jewish history.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 4: Parking Permitted</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Budapesters <i>love</i> their parks—and you will, too, because the best of the bunch offer both gorgeous greenery and plentiful bathing opportunities. If you happen to be staying at either the Grand Hotel Margitsziget or Thermal Hotel Margitsziget, Margaret Island is a serendipitous place to take the plunge. Otherwise, head for City Park, at the northeast end of Andrássy út. Developed as the centerpiece of Hungary\'s 1896 millennial celebrations, this urban oasis is the setting for the Széchenyi Baths. You could while away hours in its indoor and outdoor thermal pools. But before your toes get too wrinkled, consider City Park\'s other attractions. Beyond the baths, kids can kick back at the zoo, fun fair, and circus. Adults, meanwhile, can enjoy a smattering of museums and concert venues, plus one of Budapest\'s best-loved restaurants (Gundel).</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 5: Around the Bend</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">By now you\'ve probably crisscrossed the Danube on countless occasions. So it\'s high time you actually got out on the water. The ideal way to do it is by taking a leisurely two-hour boat trip upriver to Szentendre. Although it\'s known primarily as an artists\' colony, there\'s more to this picturesque little town than galleries and cutesy crafts shops. For instance, Hungary\'s Open-Air Ethnographic Museum (a site that re-creates village life from centuries past) is located on the outskirts. Those who wish to take everything in can gain precious sightseeing time by opting for the shorter land route when returning to Budapest. Once back, you can compensate for your abbreviated boat trip by booking a moonlight dinner cruise through the city itself.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 6: Head for the Hills</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Want to escape the urban scene without leaving the city limits? No problem. Gellért Hill is the laced with trails leading up—waaay up—to the towering Liberation Monument and the Citadella behind it. (Don\'t worry about aching muscles. You can lounge later in one of three vintage baths located on the hill). More outdoorsy adventures are available in the Buda Hills: and you don\'t have to be die-hard hiker to take advantage of them. János Hill, for example, can be accessed via a panoramic chairlift or a narrow-gauge train that\'s operated primarily by children. You\'ll find equally intriguing sites <i>beneath</i> these hills: namely some 200 caves, several of which are open to sightseers and spelunkers. Whatever you choose, reward yourself afterward with a down-home Hungarian dinner, complete with noodle pudding and live Gypsy music.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Navigating Budapest</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As in Paris, neighborhoods in Budapest are known and referred to locally not by name but by their district number, the equivalent of the Paris arrondissement. The standard format for street addresses is: first the district number—on maps Roman numerals designate each of Budapest\'s 22 districts, while on envelopes the middle two numerals of the four-digit zip code indicate the district (e.g., a specific neighborhood in District VII might have a 1072 zip code)—followed by the word \"Budapest\" (sometimes followed by the Roman numeral, just to be certain); and then the street name and street number. For the sake of clarity, in this book the word \"District\" precedes the Roman numeral. For easier reference, we\'ve also delineated and named neighborhoods. Although the lower-numbered districts are generally downtown and the farther you go into the outskirts in all directions the higher the district number, it\'s not quite as simple as that: the first several numbers—Districts I (including Castle Hill), II, and III—are in Buda and border the Danube, while District IV somehow ended up in northern Pest (along the Danube) well away from downtown, and Districts V through IX are all wholly or at least partly in downtown Pest (parts of V and IX border the river). Whereas District X is in eastern Pest, far from the Danube, some areas of downtown Buda by the river fall within District XI.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Districts V, VI, VII, and some of IX are in downtown Pest; District I includes Castle Hill, Buda\'s main tourist district.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You will find few reminders among street names of the era of communist rule, when streets and squares were named after Soviet heroes and concepts. If you look carefully at street signs, you may still find some with the old names crossed out with a triumphant red line. Today many of Budapest\'s streets and squares are named after famous Hungarian composers, poets, and painters, reflecting the nation\'s strong regard for music and the arts.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Keep in mind that Hungary numbers building levels starting from zero (i.e., the ground floor is 0, next floor up is 1, etc.)</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The following translations will help you in your navigating:</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>út</b> (sometimes <i>útja</i>) means road or avenue</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>utca</b> (u.) means street</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>tér</b> (sometimes <i>tere</i>) means square</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>körút</b> (krt.) means ring road</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>körtér</b> and <i>körönd</i> mean circle</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>kerület</b> (ker.) means district</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>emelet</b> (em.) means floor</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>földszint</b> (fsz.) means ground floor</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Quintessential Budapest</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Life Aquatic</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although the Danube is Budapest\'s most famous body of water, it\'s the therapeutic H20 spewed up daily by 100-odd hot springs that sets local hearts aflutter. Ancient Romans—the guys who coined the word \"spa\" (an acronym for \"<i>solus per aqua</i>\" or \"health by water\")—were the first to exploit the springs by building baths around them 2,000 years ago. Simply put: they came, they saw, they conquered…and then they soaked. Later occupiers followed suit: including the Ottoman Turks, who built their own dramatically domed facilities, and the Habsburgs, who erected oh-so-atmospheric Beaux Arts beauties. Add in the later contributions of communists and capitalists, and Budapest has over a dozen thermal baths. More than mere monuments, these are part of the fabric of life. And, on any given day a large percentage of the city\'s population seems to take a dip in one.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Not Your Average Joe</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Budapesters have been drinking copious amounts of coffee ever since the Turks introduced it in 1579. But they seldom grab a cup to go: city coffeehouses are elegant affairs designed for lingering. Indeed, in the 19th and early 20th centuries they served as extended living rooms for impoverished intellectuals. The communists, fearing cafés were hotbeds of sedition, closed most of them down. A few—like Gerbaud—survived, while others—like the Café Central—have been revived. All offer an extensive coffee menu. (Ask for standard \"kávé\" to get espresso; specify \"amerikai kávé\" to get a weaker brew and a disdainful stare.) All, moreover, boast an absurd array of decadent tortes, fruit-filled strudels, and fanciful marzipan creations. Sure they\'re fattening, but given how much goose liver and goulash you\'ll consume on your trip, extra calories hardly matter.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hungary\'s Right-Hand Man</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\'s hard to ignore Szent István (St. Stephen to the tongue-tied). Stamps and forints bear his image; places and people bear his name; and statues of him pop up everywhere. Admittedly István wasn\'t Hungary\'s most devout saint: that distinction goes to Margaret, who entered a convent as a child and swore she\'d rather cut off her nose than leave it. Nor was he the most spectacularly martyred (St. Gellért wins that award for rolling downhill in a spike-lined barrel). But as Hungary\'s first king, István remains the hands-down favorite. After being crowned in 1000, he turned loosely linked tribes into a centralized state and converted his pagan subjects to Christianity, thereby allying Hungary with the burgeoning powers of western Europe. Curiously, citizens express their undying gratitude each St. Stephen\'s Day (August 20) by parading his mummified right hand around Szent István Bazilika.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Seeing Red</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You cannot appreciate how much has been achieved in Budapest in recent years until you acknowledge the not-so-distant Soviet domination. Though a generation has come of age since the Iron Curtain parted in 1989, reminders of the regime are relatively easy to find. Observe the dispiriting blocks of Soviet-built housing. Note the older edifices still bullet-pocked from World War II and the 1956 Hungarian Uprising. Walk through Szobor Park, where overbearing statutes of Lenin, Marx, and assorted comrades were exiled after Communism collapsed. Or visit the controversial—and undeniably disturbing—Terror Háza. Once headquarters of the State Security Police, it\'s now a museum that uses propaganda posters, arresting displays (including a re-created \"interrogation\" room), and videotaped interviews with victims to make the past palpable.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

In good weather it draws a multitudinous cross section of the city\'s population out to its gardens and sporting facilities. The outdoor pool complex of the Palatinus Baths, built in 1921, can attract tens of thousands of people on a summer day. Nearby are a tennis stadium, a youth athletic center, boathouses, sports grounds, and, most impressive of all, the Nemzeti Sportuszoda (National Sports Swimming Pool), designed by the architect Alfred Hajós (while still in his teens, Hajós won two gold medals in swimming at the first modern Olympic Games, held in Athens in 1896). The island\'s natural curative hot springs have given rise to the Danubius Grand and Thermal hotels on the northern end of the island and are piped into two spa hotels on the mainland, the Aquincum on the Buda bank and the Hélia on the Pest side.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To experience Margaret Island\'s role in Budapest life fully, go on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon to join and/or watch people whiling away the day. Sunday is a particularly good choice for strategic sightseers, who can utilize the rest of the week to cover those city sights and areas that are closed on Sunday. On weekdays you\'ll share the island only with joggers and children playing hooky from school.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The island was first mentioned almost 2,000 years ago as the summer residence of the commander of the Roman garrison at nearby Aquincum. Later known as Rabbit Island (Insula Leporum), it was a royal hunting ground during the Árpád dynasty. King Imre, who reigned from 1196 to 1204, held court here, and several convents and monasteries were built here during the Middle Ages. (During a walk round the island, you\'ll see the ruins of a few of these buildings.) It takes its current name from St. Margaret (1242-71), the pious daughter of King Béla IV, who at the ripe old age of 10 retired to a Dominican nunnery situated here from the 13th to the 16th centuries.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Through the center of the island runs the <b>Muvész sétány</b> (Artists\' Promenade), lined with busts of Hungarian visual artists, writers, and musicians. Shaded by giant plane trees, it\'s a perfect place to stroll. The promenade passes close to the <b>rose garden</b> (in the center of the island), a large grassy lawn surrounded by blooming flower beds planted with hundreds of kinds of flowers. It\'s a great spot to picnic or to watch a game of soccer. Just east of the rose garden is a small, free game farm, the <b>Margit-sziget Vadaspark.</b> A fenced-in compound houses a menagerie of goats, storks, rabbits, deer, ducks, a bunch of sad-looking falcons in a tiny cage, and other assorted birds, including gargantuan peacocks that seem to have the run of the place, getting in your way on the paths.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the northern end of the island is a copy of the water-powered <b>Marosvásárhelyi zenélo kút</b> (Marosvásárhely Musical Fountain), which plays songs and chimes. The original was designed more than 150 years ago by a Transylvanian named Péter Bodor. It stands near a serene, artificial rock garden with Japanese dwarf trees and lily ponds. The stream coursing through it never freezes, for it comes from a natural hot spring, causing it instead to give off thick steam in winter that enshrouds the garden in a mystical cloud. Metro: M3: Árpád híd. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mátyás templom</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The ornate white (er, sooty white) steeple of the Matthias Church is the highest point on Castle Hill. It was added in the 15th century, above a 13th-century Gothic chapel. Officially the Buda Church of Our Lady, it has been known as the Matthias Church since the 15th century, in remembrance of the so-called \"just king\" who greatly added to and embellished it during his reign. Many of these changes were lost when the Turks converted it into a mosque. The intricate white stonework, mosaic roof decorations, and some of its geometric patterned columns seem to suggest Byzantium, yet it was substantially rebuilt again in the neo-baroque style 87 years after the Turkish defeat in 1686. One fortunate survivor of all the changes was perhaps the finest example of Gothic stone carving in Hungary, the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, visible above the door on the side of the church that faces the Danube.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Szentháromság Kápolna</b> (Trinity Chapel) holds an <i>encolpion,</i> an enameled casket containing a miniature copy of the Gospel to be worn on the chest; it belonged to the 12th-century king Béla III and his wife, Anne of Chatillon. Their burial crowns and a cross, scepter, and rings found in their excavated graves are also displayed here. The church\'s <b>treasury</b> contains Renaissance and baroque chalices, monstrances, and vestments. High Mass is celebrated every Sunday at 10 AM, sometimes with full orchestra and choir—and often with major soloists; get here early if you want a seat. During the summer there are usually organ recitals on Sundays at 7:30 PM. COST: Church and treasury 550 HUF; treasury only 330 HUF. OPEN: Church weekdays 9-5, Sat. 9-3:30 (often closed to the public on Sat. afternoon), Sun. 3-5; treasury daily 9-5. Metro: Várbusz (4th stop from M2: Moszkva tér). </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Muvészetek Palotája</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Situated in southern Pest, at the foot of the Lágymányosi Bridge, right beside the similarly grand National Theater (which opened five years earlier), this monumental (750,000-square-foot) venue is not just a place where the capital\'s nouveau riche can spend their forints on a wide array of musical, theatrical, and dance performances in addition to dining in style. As per the title of a brochure advertising its splendors, it is also an \"experience in every sense\"—much of which is accessible free of charge to anyone who wants to wander around inside. Of course, you first have to make your way to Boráros tér and take the HÉV commuter train one stop—a bit of a bother, but worth it, if you have several days in Budapest. On the outside the place does indeed look palatial, in a very modern sense. The inside, as spacious and as sparkling as it is, contains plenty of intimate, well-cushioned little nooks on all floors on both sides of its National Concert Hall—which occupies its center—where you can take a seat and ponder life and/or art.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In addition to housing the National Concert Hall, the Festival Theatre, a restaurant, and a couple of stores, the Palace is home to the <b>Ludwig Múzeum</b>, a venue of contemporary art that moved here in 2005 from its former home in Castle Hill\'s Royal Palace. The permanent collection covers American Pop Art (e.g., Warhol); the German, French, and Italian trans-avant-garde; and Eastern and Central European art (including, of course, Hungarian art from the 1960s to the present day.) District IX, Komor Marcell utca 1. tel. 1/555-3444. COST: Free, special exhibits 1,000 HUF.

While used for regular services during much of the year, it is generally not used in midwinter, as the space is too large to heat; between December and February, visiting hours are erratic. In the courtyard behind the synagogue a weeping willow made of metal honors the victims of the Holocaust. Liszt and Saint-Saëns are among the great musicians who played the synagogue\'s grand organ. COST: Free. OPEN: Mon.-Thurs. 10-5, Fri. and Sun. 10-2. Metro: M2: Astoria. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Szent István Bazilika</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Handsome and massive, this is one of the chief landmarks of Pest and the city\'s largest church—it can hold 8,500 people. Its very Holy Roman front porch greets you with a tympanum bustling with statuary. The basilica\'s dome and the dome of Parliament are by far the most visible in the Pest skyline, and this is no accident: with the Magyar Millennium of 1896 in mind (the lavishly celebrated thousandth anniversary of the settling of the Carpathian Basin in 896), both domes were planned to be 315 feet high.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The millennium was not yet in sight when architect József Hild began building the basilica in neoclassical style in 1851, two years after the revolution was suppressed. After Hild\'s death, the project was taken over in 1867 by Miklós Ybl, the architect who did the most to transform modern Pest into a monumental metropolis. Wherever he could, Ybl shifted Hild\'s motifs toward the neo-Renaissance mode that Ybl favored. When the dome collapsed, partly damaging the walls, he made even more drastic changes. Ybl died in 1891, five years before the 1,000-year celebration, and the basilica was completed in neo-Renaissance style by József Kauser—but not until 1905.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Below the cupola is a rich collection of late-19th-century Hungarian art: mosaics, altarpieces, and statuary (what heady days the Magyar Millennium must have meant for local talents). There are 150 kinds of marble, all from Hungary except for the Carrara in the sanctuary\'s centerpiece: a white statue of King (St.) Stephen I, Hungary\'s first king and patron saint. Stephen\'s mummified right hand is preserved as a relic in the <b>Szent Jobb Kápolna</b> (Holy Right Chapel); press a button and it will be illuminated for two minutes. You can also climb the 364 stairs (or take the elevator) to the top of the cupola for a spectacular view of the city. Extensive renovation work here has, among other things, returned the cathedral from a sooty gray to an almost bright tan. Guided tours (available in English) cost 2,000 HUF and leave five times a day on weekdays (the first at 9:30) and twice on Saturdays (at 9:30 and 11). COST: Church and Szt. Jobb Chapel free, cupola 500 HUF. OPEN: Church Mon.-Sat. 9-5:30, Sun. 1-5:30. Szt. Jobb Chapel Apr.-Oct., Mon.-Sat. 9-5, Sun. 1-5; Nov.-Mar., Mon.-Sat. 10-4, Sun. 1-4.

Allow a half day each for Plaza de Mayo, El Centro, San Telmo, La Boca, Palermo, and La Recoleta. If possible visit La Recoleta on Saturday and San Telmo and La Boca on Sunday to browse their respective markets. Plan museum time in advance as opening days vary, though shops tend to be open seven days a week. Schedule time for an evening siesta to allow you late dinner and a lengthy night out at a club, bar, or tango hall.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>5 Days:</b> With five days you can enjoy all the sights listed in the three-day itinerary above at a more leisurely pace. You\'ll also have more time to tour the riverside promenade of Puerto Madero or head north to the neighborhood of Belgrano.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>7 Days:</b> With a week you can fully enjoy all the sights suggested in the three- and five-day itineraries above and venture beyond the city. You could take a day trip just outside town to San Antonio de Areco or up the river delta to Tigre. A day trip to the picturesque and historic city of Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, 45 minutes away by ferry is also another option.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>10 Days:</b> Spend six or seven days touring Buenos Aires and its immediate environs. Then add on a two- or three-day trip northeast to the breathtaking Cataratas del Iguazú (Iguazú Falls) on the border with Brazil. Alternatively, you make a three- or four-day trip west to Córdoba and/or the wine regions of San Juan, Mendoza, San Rafael, or San Luis.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Best Buys </h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Mate for Two.</b> Even if you don\'t see yourself drinking mate (tea made from a South American shrub) every day, the drink\'s paraphernalia make unusual souvenirs. You could fork over hundreds of dollars for one of Juan Carlos Pallarols\'s ornate silver kits (a drinking vessel and metal straw), but the kid-size sets at Recursos Infantiles or La Pescadería go for 40 pesos, include a mini kettle and thermos and are easier to pack. Although the best boxy leather mate bags (for carrying thermos and vessel) sell at La Feria de Mataderos, another market, for 70 pesos and up, at La Feria de la Recoleta, simple vessels made from gourds start at 5 pesos. Supermarkets sell mate; Rosamonte, one of many brands, costs 4 pesos.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Dressing to Match.</b> You\'ve come to Argentina, you\'ve been to the fútbol stadium, and you\'ve seen a match—what\'s left to do? Buy a T-shirt. Go neutral with the pale-blue and white national team shirt, or choose a local team\'s colors. <b>Código Fútbol</b> (Juncal 1502, La Recoleta) sells a great range of shirts; prices start at 75 pesos.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Football at Your Fingertips.</b> The chances of seeing the nation\'s soccer hero, Diego Armando Maradona, in action are slim, but get your hands—or thumbs, rather—on his greatest moment with the photo flipbook <i>El Gol del Siglo.</i> It shows his famous goal against England in the 1986 World Cup, and sells for 19 pesos at the MALBA book shop and Prometeo.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Comic Relief.</b> It may be unfamiliar to you, but the classic \'60s cartoon strip \"Mafalda\" is close to the heart of all Argentines. The idealistic little girl it stars is an icon, and most downtown <i>kioscos de diarios</i> (newsstands) sell the flimsy Ediciones de la Flor collections of the strip for around 15 pesos. Alternatively, Prometeo often stocks pricier English translations.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Sweet Stuff.</b> It\'s brown, goopy, and sickly sweet…but you know you want more <i>dulce de leche</i> (a spread made from sweetened condensed milk). All supermarkets stock such popular brands as La Serenísima (3 pesos), or go to one of the many Havanna café-shops (they proliferate the city like Starbucks branches in Seattle) for a posh glass jar (10 pesos). Havanna\'s <i>alfajores</i> (chocolate-covered dulce-de-leche-filled cookies) are also sure to earn you fans back home (16 pesos for 12).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The Best Cuts.</b> Sneaking a bloody steak in your suitcase won\'t work. A more packable souvenir of is the traditional <i>asado</i> knife. Practical wood- or horn-handled knives are available at most markets starting at around 50 pesos, depending on blade quality (surgical steel is best if you intend to actually use the knife). Silver and alpaca are often used to decorate the hilt and sheath of the more elaborate knives sold for much heftier prices at silversmiths like Platería Parodi.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Wine-ing Away the Hours.</b> Argentina is the world\'s fifth-largest wine producing country. Although a bottle of award-winning red stuff like Catena Zapata might stretch to hundreds of dollars, other excellent wines include Trapiche\'s Fond de Cave Malbec Reserva, available for around 25 pesos from Ligier as well as most major supermarkets.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Top Reasons to Go</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">1. Plaza de Mayo: The plaza has been the site of many important events throughout the nation\'s history. Today, it is an important site for ceremonies and mass protests.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">2. Museo de Arte de Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires. <i>MALBA</i> is one of the cornerstones of the city\'s cultural life, with a memorable collection of 19th- and 20th-century Latin American Art.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">3. Parque Tres de Febrero: Two hundred acres of lawns, copses, lakes, and trails make up this enchanting park, which also encompasses a crazy-quilt of smaller parks known as Los Bosques de Palermo.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">4.

Córdoba-based studio AFT Arquitectos beat other architects in the competition to design the building, and their distinctive triangular construction in creamy stone and steel is one of the museum\'s draws. The main galleries run along the left of a stunning four-story atrium, flooded in natural light from a wall of windows—local artists often create installations.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Businessman and founder Eduardo Constantini\'s collection of more than 220 works of 19th- and 20th-century Latin-American art—one of the world\'s largest and the museum\'s centerpiece—is on the first floor. It includes paintings by Diego Rivera, Tarsila do Amaral, Xul Solar, Roberto Matta, and Joaquín Torres García, who brought their experiences in the European avant-garde to bear on Latin American realities. Geometric paintings and sculptures from the 1940s represent movements such as Arte Concreto, Constructivism, and Arte Madí, all born in Latin America. There\'s also a solid collection of optical and kinetic sculptures. The main gallery has works by the likes of Frida Kahlo and Fernando Botero, and concludes with abstract, psychedelic, and conceptual pieces from the late 20th century. All labels are in English, though not all the excellent gallery introductions are. Young, enthusiastic guides give great tours in Spanish; you can call ahead to arrange group English-language tours.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">World-class temporary exhibitions are held on the second floor three or four times a year, and two small basement galleries show art by cutting-edge locals. You can give your feet—and eyes—a rest on the first floor sculpture deck, with views over Belgrano and Barrio Norte. MALBA also has by far the best art cinema in town, it shows restored copies of classics, never-released features, and silent films with live music, as well as local films of note. Be sure to leave yourself time to browse the art books and funky design objects of the museum\'s excellent gift shop.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Highlights of the Constantini Collection:</b> The iconic shapes and tropical colors of <i>Abaporu</i> (1928) by Tarsila do Amaral, a Brazilian involved in the \"cannibalistic\" Movimento Antropofágico (rather than eating white Europeans, proponents of the movement proposed devouring European culture and digesting it into something new); autodidact Xul Solar\'s watercolors, which fuse Latin American symbols with kabbalistic ideas; Antonio Berni\'s poptastic collage <i>The Great Temptation</i> (1962) and the bizarre sculpture <i>Voracity or Ramona\'s Nightmare</i> (1964), both featuring the eccentric prostitute Ramona, a character Berni created in this series of works that criticize consumer society.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Kids Love:</b> Hands on kinetic works like Julio Le Parc\'s <i>Seven Unexpected Movements,</i> a wall-mounted sculpture with gleaming parts that move at the press of a button.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Argentine Artists of the Moment:</b> Liliana Porter, Marta Minujín, Guillermo Kuitca, and Alejandro Kuropatwa.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Don\'t Leave Without Buying:</b> A one-of-a-kind book from offbeat publishing house Eloisa Cartonera—the covers are handpainted on cardboard bought from <i>cartoneros</i> (people who sift through garbage looking for such recyclables as paper and cardboard), and the texts are provided by quirky local writers like Fabián Casas or Washington Cucurto (6 pesos); old-style wooden toys and spinning tops by Trompos (35 pesos and up); one of Roman Vitali\'s purses or lamps made entirely from individually wired jewel-colored beads (200 pesos and up).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>On the Menu:</b> The sleek split-level <b>Malba Restaurant</b> (tel. 11/4801-3386.

Wait for the collections to open over a <i>submarino</i> (steamed milk with dark chocolate melted into it) and <i>rogel Mendocino</i> (mille-feuille pastry with dulce de leche), or linger between closing time and a film in the cinema for a dinner of <i>cordero con milhojas de papa</i> (lamb shank with layered potatoes) and the not-to-be-missed chocolate mousse.

Rich grass and shady trees make this an urban oasis, although the busy roads and horn-honking drivers that crisscross the park never quite let you forget what city you\'re in. South of Avenida Figueroa Alcorta you can take part in organized tai chi and exercise classes or impromptu soccer matches; you can also jog, bike, in-line skate, or take a boat out on the small lake.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\'re looking for a sedate activity, try the <b>Museo de Artes Plásticas Eduardo Sívori</b> (Eduardo Sívori Art Museum, Av. Infanta Isabel 555. tel. 11/4774-9452. www.museosivori.org. COST: 3 pesos, Wed. free. OPEN: Tues.-Fri. noon-6, weekends 10-6), exhibiting 19th- and 20th-century Argentine art. The 4,000-works-strong collection includes sculptures, engravings, and paintings by local masters like Lino Eneo Spilimbergo and the museum\'s namesake Sívori, as well as handmade textiles and weavings from all over the country.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Close to the Museo de Artes Plásticas Eduardo Sívori is the <b>Paseo del Rosedal</b> (Rose Garden, Avs. Infanta Isabel and Iraola), where approximately 15,000 rosebushes, representing more than 1,000 different species, bloom seasonally. A stroll along the clay paths takes you through the Jardín de los Poetas (Poets\' Garden), dotted with statues of literary figures, and to the enchanting Patio Andaluz (Andalusian Patio) whose majolica tiles and Spanish mosaics sit under a vine-covered pergola.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The sci-fi exterior of the landmark <b>Planetario Galileo Galilei</b> (Galileo Galilei Planetarium, Avs. Sarmiento and Belisario Roldán. tel. 11/4771-6629. COST: Free. OPEN: Weekdays 9-5, weekends 3-8) holds more appeal than its flimsy content. This great orb positioned on a massive concrete tripod looks like something out of <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind,</i> and it seems as though small green men in foil suits could descend from its central staircase at any moment. A highlight is the authentic asteroid at the entrance; the pond with swans, geese, and ducks is a favorite with children.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Arched wooden bridges and walkways traverse still waters in the <b>Jardín Japonés</b> (Japanese Garden, Avs. Casares and Adolfo Berro. tel. 11/4804-4922. www.jardinjapones.com.ar. COST: 3 pesos. OPEN: Daily 10-6). A variety of shrubs and flowers frame the ponds, which brim with friendly koi carp that let you pet them should you feel inclined. The traditional teahouse, where you can enjoy adzuki-bean sweets and tea, overlooks a zen garden.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On sunny weekends, Los Bosques de Palermo get crowded and garbage-strewn, as this is where families come for strolls or picnics. Street vendors sell refreshments and <i>choripan</i> (chorizo sausage in a bread roll) within the park, and there are also many posh cafés lining the Paseo de la Infanta (running from Libertador toward Sarmiento in the park). </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Others have been more positive. Missionary and explorer Louis Hennepin, whose books were widely read across Europe, first described the falls in 1678 as \"an incredible Cataract or Waterfall which has no equal.\" Nearly two centuries later, novelist Charles Dickens wrote,\"I seemed to be lifted from the earth and to be looking into Heaven. Niagara was at once stamped upon my heart, an image of beauty, to remain there changeless and indelible.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Writer Henry James recorded in 1883 how one stands there \"gazing your fill at the most beautiful object in the world.\" And a half-century later, British author Vita Sackville-West wrote in a letter,\"Niagara is really some waterfall! It falls over like a great noisy beard made of cotton-wool, veiled by spray and spanned by rainbows. The rainbows are the most unexpected part of it. They stand across like bridges between America and Canada, and are reproduced in sections along the boiling foam. The spray rises to the height of a skyscraper, shot by sudden iridescence high up in the air.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Understandably, all these rave reviews began to bring out the professional daredevils, as well as the self-destructive amateurs. In 1859 the great French tightrope walker Blondin walked across the Niagara Gorge, from the American to the Canadian side, on a three-inch-thick rope. On his shoulders was his reluctant, terrified manager; on both shores stood some 100,000 spectators. \"Thank God it is over,\" exclaimed the future King Edward VII of England, after the completion of the walk. \"Please never attempt it again.\" But others did. From the early 18th century, dozens went over in boats, rubber balls, and those famous barrels. Not a single one survived—until schoolteacher Annie Taylor did in 1901. Emerging from her barrel, she asked,\"Did I go over the falls yet?\" The endless stunts were finally outlawed in 1912, but nothing stops the determined: in 1985 two stuntmen survived a plunge, and two years later, someone who had conquered the falls mastered the rapids below the falls.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Besides daredevils, the other thing that springs to mind at the mention of Niagara are honeymoons. The first honeymooners arrived in 1803: Jerome Bonaparte (brother of Napoléon) and his bride, the daughter of a prosperous Baltimore merchant. On a grand tour of the Northeast, the newlyweds stayed a week, inaugurating a tradition. By the mid-1800s honeymoons at Niagara had become quite the rage and were a definite status symbol for young couples.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

American Falls is the highest, but not by much, and it\'s about half as wide as the Canadian cascade. Bridal Veil is the smallest of the three. Several small islands dot the river here. Goat Island, part of <b>Niagara Falls State Park,</b> separates Horseshoe Falls from the U.S. falls and offers spectacular vantage points of both sides.

The sheer cliff walls of the 17-mi gorge soar nearly 600 feet in some spots, which is why the park is often called the Grand Canyon of the East. The river spills over three large waterfalls—one 107 feet high—and the long and narrow park encompasses awesome rock formations and dense forest. Some 66 mi of trails are used for hiking, biking, horse-back riding, snowmobiling, and cross-country skiing. Many activities here center on water; you may go fishing, white-water rafting, or kayaking, or swim in one of two pools. Ice-skating, snow tubing, and horse-drawn sleigh rides round out the winter options. Park accommodations include tent and trailer campsites (open mid-May to mid-October), winterized cabins, and the Glen Iris Inn.

Tomb and temple reliefs show offering tables piled high with food, and tomb scenes depict stages of food preparation. Feasting and picnicking was an intrinsic part of ancient (and modern) Egyptian culture, and great varieties of foodstuffs were used as picnic fodder. Picnics were sometimes held on boats on the river, which you can do aboard a felucca.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Two ancient Egyptian staples were bread and beer, augmented by vegetables such as onions, squashes, cucumbers, and lettuce. Garlic and legumes, such as <i>mulukhaia</i> (lentils) and chickpeas, made up a large part of the diet of rich and poor alike. Cheese and yogurt were also eaten. Wealthier people, of course, were able to afford more varied diets.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Egyptians ate domesticated animals, fished, and hunted animals and birds. The main domesticates were sheep, goats, cattle, and pigs. The hunted animals, which were often captured live and fattened up before slaughter, were antelopes, gazelles, and, particularly in the Old Kingdom, hyenas. Geese, ducks, pigeons, and other fowl were hunted or bred, and fish were caught from the Nile. Mullet roe was processed and eaten with pleasure; in fact, this roe, known as Egyptian caviar, has graced many gourmands\' tables in the 20th century. Meats were generally grilled or stewed, or in some cases, salted and preserved for leaner times.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Egyptians had more than 30 kinds of bread, including dessert breads. Fruit such as dates, dom nuts, grapes, pomegranates, cactus figs, and <i>nabk</i> berries were common. Fruit was fermented and used to make wine—date wine, pomegranate wine, grape wine, and palm wine (made from the sap of palm trees).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tomb scenes often show Egyptians reveling at elaborate gatherings. Guests were greeted by their hosts, given scented flower garlands, and shown to a seat. They wore perfumed fat cones on their heads over their wigs, and servants brought them food and drink, all while they were entertained by conversation, music, singing, and dancing. Groups of musicians and scantily clad dancers performed for hours at these functions. Food and drink was placed on small tables to be shared between two or three people, and wine and beer constantly replenished whenever cups were empty. Some tombs show the unfortunate results of overindulgence: in one case a guest is being carried out of the party because he has passed out.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Religion</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Egyptian religion is immensely complex, and it is not well understood by scholars. Beliefs and practices changed, sometimes radically, over 3,000 years of Egyptian history, and few easily understandable texts were left behind. On the surface the religion was polytheistic, with many gods derived from nature and natural elements that surrounded them, but the gods were all manifestations of aspects of one great divine force. During the course of Egyptian history several of the gods were syncretized.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The pharaoh was regarded as a living god closely identified with the falcon god, Horus. Apart from the pharaoh, there was generally one state (or major) god. People would also worship local city gods or patron deities relevant to their employment. This might be likened to the the Christian practice of having patron saints. The gods all had specific powers attributed to them, were associated with special animals, and had specific feast days. Gods were also often viewed in groups of trinities consisting of a father, a mother, and a child.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ancient deities were worshipped in temples, in shrines in people\'s houses, and possibly on the wayside. Temples were of two types: cult and mortuary. <b>Cult temples</b> were located for the most part on the east bank of the Nile, and they were dedicated to the cult of a particular god. Their main focus was to house an image of the deity and to see to its comfort—temples were viewed quite literally as houses of the god. The temples were large, sprawling buildings to which successive pharaohs would add their own places of worship. In addition to the temple proper, there were libraries—buildings where doctors, astronomers, and botanists did their research—housing for priests, and storage areas for grain and other items. Temples owned land that they farmed or rented out, and they functioned as administrative and religious centers. A temple\'s high priest had many ranks of priests below him.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Mortuary temples</b> were similar to cult temples, save for the fact that they were built on the west bank of the Nile and were primarily dedicated to the cult of the deceased pharaoh. Within their precincts there were also places of worship for various gods.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For most of Egyptian history the chief among the major gods was <b>Re,</b> or Amun-Re, a solar deity who saw to the balance and functioning of the world. Karnak at Thebes (now Luxor) was his primary temple. His wife was Mut, a goddess of queenship. Khonsu, his son, was the moon god.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the Middle Kingdom (2040-1640 BC) onward, <b>Osiris</b> was one of the most important Egyptian gods. He is depicted as a mummiform figure and was the ruler of the afterworld. As such the dead pharaoh was associated with Osiris. His main sacred site is the fabulously elegant New Kingdom (1550-1070 BC) temple at Abydos, north of Luxor. His wife was <b>Isis,</b> goddess of magic and one of the most important figures in the Egyptian pantheon. Their child was <b>Horus,</b> often shown as a falcon, the symbol of kingship. Reigning pharaohs were always associated with Horus.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Seth</b> was the brother of Osiris, and during the Late and Greco-Roman periods was regarded as Osiris\'s mortal enemy (Abydos and Kom Ombo <i>in</i> Chapter 4 for the story of Seth\'s murder of Osiris). He was god of storms and deserts. His wife was <b>Nephthys,</b> a goddess associated with funerary rituals.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Jackal-headed <b>Anubis</b> was in charge of embalming and mummification and the actual trip to the afterworld. In the Hellenic and Christian eras he was associated with Hermes, then with the now-decanonized St. Christopher.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Maat</b> was the goddess of truth, justice, balance, and order, all very important concepts in the Egyptian view of the world.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As well as being associated with kingship, <b>Hathor</b> was the goddess of love, music, beauty, and dancing. She was also goddess of remote places, such as turquoise mines. One of her sacred sites is Deir al-Bahri, Queen Hatshepsut\'s magnificent temple on Luxor\'s west bank.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Ptah</b> was a creator god, associated with Memphis. <b>Sekhmet,</b> his wife, was goddess of plagues, revenge, and restitution. Their child was <b>Nefertum,</b> associated with rebirth in the afterworld.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Thoth</b> was the ibis-headed god of writing and knowledge, and he was associated with the moon.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ram-headed <b>Khnum</b> was associated with creation and fashioning people on a potter\'s wheel. His wife was <b>Anukis,</b> their daughter, <b>Satis.</b> They were all important in the region of the first cataract of the Nile, around Aswan, and therefore Khnum was associated with the river\'s annual inundation. It is interesting that there was no god identified specifically with the Nile, though the plump god depicted with pendulous breasts, <b>Hapi,</b> was the god of the inundation.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Egyptian Way of Death</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most pharaonic monuments in Egypt are related to death. This was not because Egyptians had some morbid fascination with death, but rather because of their overwhelming love of life and a desire for its continuance. This is why the people took great care to prepare their tombs and their mummies in a manner that would ensure that they would be happy and well provided for in the afterlife. For poorer people, the preparations were limited to a simple tomb, a few grave goods, basic mummification, and some kind of grave marker or stela. For the wealthy, a more complicated, well-decorated tomb, abundant grave goods, and elaborate mummification were the standard.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Tombs</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The west bank of the Nile was the preferred location for tombs, and the east bank was for settlements—except when this was impractical because of the nature of local arable land. These preferences were based on the Egyptians\' solar beliefs about death and rebirth. The sun rises—is born and reborn—in the east and sets—dies—in the west, and Egyptians organized their living and dying areas to coincide with the sun\'s path. Egyptian tombs tend to be in the desert, far from arable, and consequently usable, land. These desert locations also ensured that the bodies of the deceased would not be disturbed by the annual flood (which has stopped since the construction of the Aswan dams).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The earliest surviving graves are simple depressions scooped into the desert sand and gravel, dating to the period before 3000 BC. Bodies were placed in a fetal position and surrounded by grave goods such as pots, beads, knives, and so forth. As practices progressed, sand and stone was piled over the tombs in order to mark them. These tombs are known as <b>tumuli.</b> Throughout Egyptian history poor individuals were buried in such sandy graves, with a few grave goods to use in the afterlife as they had used them while alive.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The next step in tomb evolution is the <b>mastaba.</b> Mastabas—meaning bench in Arabic, so-called because of the similarity between the shape of the tombs and benches in village houses—were used as burial places for both royalty and nobles during the first two dynasties. Thereafter, with the advent of the pyramid, pharaohs were buried in pyramids, and others in mastabas. Mastaba burials consist of two parts, the substructure, the actual underground burial area, and the superstructure, the tomb building itself. The earliest mastabas were made of mud brick with solid superstructures and a small niche that contained a stela. In the 2nd Dynasty (2770-2649 BC) the superstructures were made to resemble houses, because the tomb was seen as the house for the soul. <i>Ka</i> (the individual essence) and <i>ba</i> (the active, immortal essence) were two of the aspects of an individual\'s soul.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the 3rd Dynasty (2649-2575 BC), some mastabas were made of stone and others of mud brick, with niches set in the south and northeast faces. These niches contained stelae and offering tablets for the dead. The substructures, often reached from the roof of the superstructure, were simple rooms with space for a body and some grave goods. This form of substructure remains mostly the same throughout mastaba construction, with small changes made to the access routes to the building.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">By the end of the 4th Dynasty (2575-2465 BC), many superstructures were accessible and decorated with scenes of daily life, such as hunting, fishing, feasting, manufacturing jewelry and pottery, making bread and beer, and butchering animals. The decorated portion of a tomb is generally called the chapel, the place where offerings were brought to the deceased by family members or friends. The actual burial place would remain sealed after the body had been interred.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Pyramids</b> were the burial places of pharaohs. The ancient Egyptian word for pyramid is <i>mer,</i> derived from the verb <i>mr,</i> meaning to ascend. But the modern word <i>pyramid</i> is most likely derived from the Greek word <i>pyramis,</i> the name of a wheat cake that the pyramids were believed to have resembled. Pyramids are oriented to the cardinal points and generally entered from the north. Their shape was probably suggested by the sun cult: their triangular profile is reminiscent of the sun\'s rays seen through clouds. They might also have derived their shape from the ben-ben stone, a sacred stone, perhaps a meteorite, that served as the focus of the sun cult. The fact that pyramids were often topped by pyramidions (small pyramids) covered in gold further supports this idea.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pyramid complexes consist of a central pyramid; satellite pyramids for female family members; subsidiary pyramids for cenotaphs for the pharaoh; boat pits; a mortuary temple to the east, facing the rising sun; a covered causeway leading to a valley temple, and a quay for boats to land. From the end of the 5th Dynasty, the burial chambers inside pyramids were decorated with pyramid texts, a series of spells that helped the pharaoh to achieve a successful afterlife. Pharaohs were buried in pyramids during the Old and Middle Kingdoms.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Rock-cut tombs</b> were common from the Old Kingdom onward, and they were constructed all along the Nile Valley, especially in areas blessed with good stone cliffs. Rock-cut tombs consist of chambers cut into the rock, decorated with painted or carved scenes, and used as chapels. Burials took place inside the chambers, down a deep shaft, where the body and grave goods were placed. During the New Kingdom, pharaohs were buried in rock-cut tombs on the west bank of Thebes. These Valley of the Kings tombs were decorated primarily with religious scenes and instructions for the afterlife, while the tombs of nobles continued to be decorated with scenes of daily life. The pharaohs\' mortuary temples were erected at the edge of the cultivated areas of the west bank, far from their tombs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Shaft tombs</b> were often used by poorer individuals or were constructed for security during the later periods of Egyptian history. These tombs consist of shafts cut into the bedrock that open into one or two (generally undecorated) chambers that contained the body and the grave goods. Often a stela placed at the mouth of the shaft marked it as a grave.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Mummification</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The earliest mummies were likely made by accident, when bodies were placed in the dry desert sand. These mummies were probably accidentally found by the ancient Egyptians (when disturbed by robbers or animals) and gave birth to the idea of mummification. The ancient Egyptian word for mummy was <i>saah.</i> The present-day word is derived from the Persian/Arabic word <i>mum,</i> which means pitch or bitumen, which was thought to have been used in making mummies. It was believed that the preserved body would provide a permanent house for the soul in the afterlife. The process of mummification changed throughout Egyptian history, reaching an acme in the 21st Dynasty.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The classic method of mummification was as follows: a slit was made in the left side of the body and the lungs, liver, stomach, and intestines were removed. The heart, believed to be necessary for rebirth, was left in place. The viscera were mummified separately, wrapped, and placed either in canopic jars, or back in the body cavity prior to burial, depending on the period. Then a chisel was inserted up the nose and through the ethmoid bone. A long, slim metal instrument was then used to poke, prod, and punch the brain before it was teased out of the nostril The brain cavity was then filled with resin to purify it.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The body was first washed with palm wine, then packed with natron (a mixture of salt and carbonate found in the Wadi Natrun, northwest of Cairo), incense, and herbs. This process was repeated a few times over the course of 40 days. Then the body cavity was emptied, packed with resinous bandages and herbs, and sewn up.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After it was clean, the body was adorned with amulets and jewelry, wrapped elaborately in bandages while being prayed over by priests, anointed with oils, and enshrouded. The wrapping and anointing took another 30 days—a total of 70 days were required to make a good-quality mummy. During certain periods of Egyptian history a mask made of cartonnage (linen, papyrus, and plaster prepared like papier-maché) or gold (like that of Tutankhamun) was placed over the head and shoulders of the mummy.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The body package was then put into a wooden coffin, which, in turn, was placed in a sarcophagus (like a coffin, but larger and generally of stone), before being placed in the tomb. The canopic jars with the viscera were buried next to the body. Sometimes a funerary text containing spells to help the deceased in the afterlife was written on papyrus and placed within the coffin.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Writing</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Egyptian writing, hieroglyphics, started in about 3000 BC; it consists of a series of signs derived from nature and common utensils. Hieroglyphics are read left to right, right to left, or top to bottom: You read into the beaks of the birds or into the faces of the animals.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are two main types of signs: phonograms, which signify sounds, and determinatives, which signify what type of word it is. Phonograms have different sounds attached to them: single letter sounds, biliteral, and triliteral sounds. Thus, a hoe has the sound <i>mr,</i> and depending on its determinative can mean hoe, love, or be part of another word. Determinatives come at the end of words and help define what the word is or means. Thus, a pair of legs at the end of a word indicate that the word is a motion word meaning (depending on the spelling of the word itself) walk, move forward, or run.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Egyptian grammar and vocabulary changed throughout ancient history, with Middle Kingdom Egyptian being the most classic and widely used. Hieroglyphs (sacred images) were generally used only for important inscriptions on monuments or on papyri. Everyday accounts, letters, and even many religious texts were written in hieratic, a cursive form of hieroglyphics.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Jean-François Champollion deciphered ancient hierogylphics in 1822. Other scholars had come close to accomplishing this, but Champollion was the first one to publish his results. He managed to do this by using the Rosetta Stone, a large granite stone carved with hieroglyphs, demotic (everyday script of the Late and Greco-Roman periods), and Greek. The stone was discovered in the port city of Rosetta on Egypt\'s Mediterranean coast. The ancient Greek, still a known, if not spoken, language, provided Champollion with a clue as to how to break the code. When he broke it, Egyptology became a literate discipline.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Salima Ikram</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Gayer-Anderson was a talented collector and the house\'s contents include lovely pieces of pharaonic, Islamic, and Central Asian art. Spend some time in the reception room, where a mosaic fountain lies at the center of an ornate marble floor.

The museum is classified by medium, more or less. The first floor has carved stone and stucco, frescoes, and woodwork. The second floor includes textiles, manuscripts, icons, and metalwork. The collection includes many exquisite pieces, but several are noteworthy first for their quirkiness or their syncretism, rather than their beauty: carvings and paintings that trace the transformations of the ancient key of life, the ankh, into the cross, for example, and Christian scenes with Egyptian gods. For a detailed guide of the museum, look for Jill Kamil\'s <i>Coptic Egypt: History and Guide</i> (American University in Cairo Press). COST: £e50.

Kolkata\'s book fair, in winter, is one of the largest in the world.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Amazing Festivals</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The greatest Bengali festival of the year is the Durga Puja (Durga is an incarnation of Kali, Kolkata\'s patron goddess). The <i>pujas</i> (homage; literally,\"worship\") take place over several days in September or October. Colorful, handmade Hindu idols, sometimes more than 20 feet tall, are moved in large processions through the streets for several hours before reaching the river and being. The rites and processions blend tradition with innovation; some idols even commemorate people such as recent flood victims or the film star of the moment.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rickshaw Pullers</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kolkata is the last city on earth to use enormous Chinese-style rickshaws pulled by men on foot. The rickshaws were introduced in the 19th century by Chinese traders and the British made it a legal form of transportation in 1919. Kolkata has about 6,000 licensed rickshaw operators, but at least as many operate without licenses. The Communist government of West Bengal—concerned about its image as it positions Kolkata as a technology hub—placed a ban on the human-powered vehicles in late 2006. Government officials called the hand-pulled rickshaws \"barbaric\" and \"inhuman\" and vowed not to renew operators\' licenses. But the rickshaw-puller union is fighting the move and remains skeptical of the government\'s offer to retrain pullers to be parking lot attendants. Many pullers say they would never want to use cycle-rickshaw wallahs, who use bicycles to transport their passengers. If you ever get the chance to pull a rickshaw, you will be surprised at how difficult it is, even when the rickshaw is empty.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Inside the building is an excellent museum of the history of Calcutta (there\'s a lot to read, but it will really sharpen your sense of the British-Bengali relationship) and various Raj-related exhibits, including Queen Victoria\'s writing desk and piano, Indian miniature paintings, watercolors, and Persian books.

Mullick built the palace in 1855, making lavish use of Italian marble. It\'s behind a lawn cluttered with sculptures of lions, the Buddha, Christopher Columbus, Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and Hindu gods. Near a small granite bungalow (where Mullick\'s descendants still live), a large pool houses some exotic birds with large headdresses. The palace has an interior courtyard, complete with a throne room where a peacock often struts around the seat of honor. The upstairs rooms are downright baroque: enormous mirrors and paintings cover the walls (including works by Reynolds, Rubens, and Murillo), gigantic chandeliers hang from the ceilings, and hundreds of statues and Far Eastern urns populate the rooms. The floors bear multicolored marble inlay on a giant scale, with a calico effect. Even the lamps are detailed creations, especially those on the staircases, where metal women are entwined in trees with a light bulb on each branch. Movie producers use the palace for shooting films. Make sure to tip your guide here. COST: Free; you must obtain a pass from West Bengal Tourist Office 24 hrs in advance.

The long-distance footpath known as the Peddars Way follows the line of a pre-Roman road, running from near Thetford through heathland, pine forests, and arable fields, and on through rolling chalk lands to the Norfolk coast near Hunstanton. The Norfolk Coastal Path then continues eastward along the coast, joining at Cromer with the delightfully varied Weaver\'s Way, which passes through medieval weaving villages and deeply rural parts of the Norfolk Broads on its 56-mi route from Cromer to Great Yarmouth. Birders or anyone interested in birds should carry binoculars and a bird identification book, as both of these routes have abundant avian life—both local and migratory.

Henry VI, the king after whom the college is named, oversaw the work. This was the last period before the classical architecture of the ancient Greeks and Romans, then being rediscovered by the Italians, began to make its influence felt in Northern Europe. From the outside, the most prominent features are the expanses of glass, the massive flying buttresses, and the fingerlike spires that line the length of the building. Inside, the most obvious impression is of great space—the chapel has been described as \"the noblest barn in Europe\"—and of light flooding in from its huge windows. The brilliantly colored bosses (carved panels at the intersections of the roof ribs) are particularly intense, although hard to see without binoculars. An exhibition in the chantries, or side chapels, explains more about the chapel\'s construction. Behind the altar is <i>The Adoration of the Magi,</i> an enormous painting by Peter Paul Rubens. Every Christmas Eve a festival of carols sung by the chapel\'s famous choir is broadcast worldwide from here. A small number of tickets to this service are available for the general public, but competition is fierce.

A glass or two of excellent local wine will make any area dining experience even better.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Public Buildings</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As the country\'s capital city, Canberra has an impressive selection of public spaces that give glimpses into Australia\'s history and national character. The vast, modern Parliament House is the most famous of these, but the National Museum of Australia, National Gallery of Australia, the Australian Institute of Sport, and the Australian War Memorial are equally fascinating.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parks &amp; Nature Preserves</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Canberra\'s surrounding mountain ranges and river valleys allow for lots of invigorating outdoor pursuits—especially in autumn and spring, when the weather is crisp. Lake Burley Griffin and its environs provide a scenic backdrop for walking and cycling.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wine Touring Around Canberra</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Wineries began popping up everywhere around Canberra in the late 1990s, once it was discovered that the cool climate was optimal for producing chardonnays, Rieslings, cabernets, shirazes, merlots, and pinots. There are now about 140 vineyards set in the peaceful rural countryside surrounding the city—mostly small operations, where visiting the \"cellar door\" usually involves sampling the wines in the tasting room. There is no charge for tastings, although the vintners hope you\'ll be impressed enough with the wine to make some purchases.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most are a maximum of 30 minutes from the city and are concentrated in the villages of Hall and Murrumbateman, and in the Lake George area and Bungendore. Many are open to visits on weekends only. If you want to explore the wineries on your own, pick up a copy of <i>The Canberra District Wineries Guide</i> from the Canberra and Region Visitor Centre, or from the <b>Kamberra Wine Centre</b> (Flemington Rd. at Northbourne Ave., Lyneham. tel. 02/6262-2333. www.hardywines.com.au) at the northern entrance to Canberra overlooking the Canberra Racecourse. If you don\'t want to combine driving with wine tasting, consider a wine tour. <b>Wine Wisdom Winery Tours</b> (tel. 02/6260-7773. www.winewisdom.com.au) specializes in personally tailored wine-tour itineraries.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wineries Along the Barton Highway</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From Canberra take the Barton Highway in the direction of Yass. After 20 km (12 mi) you\'ll reach a trio of wineries: Brindabella Hills Winery, Pankhurst Wines, and Surveyors Hill Winery around the village of Hall. A few minutes farther along Barton Highway, a right turn onto Nanima Road will bring you to the Wily Trout Winery. This winery shares its property with <b>Poachers Pantry</b><b>,</b> which sells picnic-style smoked meats, poultry, and vegetables, and the <b>Smokehouse Cafe</b><b>,</b> where you can have a decadent countryside dining experience.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wineries Along the Federal Highway</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From Canberra take the Federal Highway for about 30 km (19 mi) north toward Sydney until you reach the Lake George area. Here you\'ll find Lark Hill Winery, Gidgee Estate Wines, Lambert Vineyards, and Lerida Estate Wines. At Madew Win es you can stop by <b>grapefoodwine</b> restaurant, for modern Australian, seasonally inspired cuisine and great views over Lake George.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the banks of the Molonglo River, close to the airport, is one other winery that\'s well worth visiting: <b>Pialligo Estate Wines and Cafe</b>, which is surrounded by beautiful rose gardens. Here you can enjoy a wine tasting, lunch, or an antipasto platter as the sun sets behind Parliament House.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The museum, built roughly in the shape of a Byzantine church, explores Australian military involvement from the Sudan campaign of the late 19th century through the 1970s and the Vietnam War. Displays include a Lancaster bomber, a Spitfire, tanks, landing barges, the giant German Amiens gun, and sections of two of the Japanese midget submarines that infiltrated Sydney Harbour during World War II. Each April 25 the memorial is the focus of Canberra\'s powerful Anzac Day ceremony, which honors fallen members of Australia\'s armed forces. Free guided tours take place daily at 10, 10:30, 11, 1:30, and 2.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You can best appreciate the impressive facade of the War Memorial from the broad avenue of <b>Anzac Parade.</b> Anzac is an acronym for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, formed during World War I. The avenue is flanked by several memorials commemorating the army, navy, air force, and nursing corps, as well as some of the campaigns in which Australian troops have fought, including the Vietnam War.

The museum highlights the stories of Australia and Australians by exploring the key people, events, and issues that shaped and influenced the nation. The numerous exhibitions focus on rare and unique objects that illustrate the continent\'s complex origins. Memorabilia include the carcass of the extinct Tasmanian tiger, the old Bentley beloved by former Prime Minister Robert Menzies, and the black baby garments worn by dingo victim Azaria Chamberlain (whose story was made famous in the Meryl Streep film <i>A Cry in the Dark</i>). www.nma.gov.au.

During the golden age of the Mayan civilization (also referred to as the Classic Period), when other areas on the peninsula were developing trade routes and building enormous temples and pyramids, this part of the coast remained sparsely populated. Consequently, Cancún never developed into a major Mayan center; excavations have been done at the El Rey ruins (in what is now the Zona Hotelera), showing that the Mayan communities that lived here around AD 1200 simply used this area for burial sites. Even the name given to the area was not inspiring: In Mayan, Cancún means \"nest of snakes.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When Spanish conquistadores began to arrive in the early 1500s, much of the Mayan culture was already in decline. Over the next three centuries the Spanish largely ignored coastal areas like Cancún-which consisted mainly of low-lying scrub, mangroves, and swarms of mosquitoes-and focused on settling inland where there was more economic promise.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although it received a few refugees from the War of the Castes, which engulfed the entire region in the mid-1800s, Cancún remained more or less undeveloped until the middle of the 20th century. By the 1950s, Acapulco had become the number-one tourist attraction in the country-and had given the Mexican government its first taste of tourism dollars. When Acapulco\'s star began to fade in the late \'60s, the government hired a market-research company to determine the perfect location for developing Mexico\'s next big tourist destination-and the company picked Cancún.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In April 1971, Mexico\'s President, Luis Echeverria Alvarez, authorized the Ministry of Foreign Relations to buy the island and surrounding region. With a $22 million development loan from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, the transformation of Cancún began. At the time there were just 120 residents in the area, most of whom worked at a coconut plantation; by 1979 Cancún had become a resort of 40,000, attracting more than 2 million tourists a year. That was only the beginning: today, more than 500,000 people live in Cancún, and the city has become the most lucrative source of tourist income in Mexico.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wet, Wild Water Sports</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cancún is one of the water-sports capitals of the world, and, with the Caribbean on one side of the island and the still waters of Laguna Nichupté on the other, it\'s no wonder. The most popular water activities are snorkeling and diving along the coral reef just off the coast.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Due to northeasterly winds, sports such as kiteboarding and windsurfing have become increasingly popular. Although waves are not as constant as those on the Pacific side, it is possible to find some decent surf in and around Cancún. During December and January, waves peak at about six feet, but it usually takes a windstorm or winter swell to make the choppy paddle worthwhile. During hurricane season, from May through November, the surf can be borderline epic on a good day. For the avid beach-break surfer, the sandbars are best at Playa Delfines, Chamol, and City Beach. Twenty miles south of Cancún are several point breaks off the coast of Puerto Morelos and Punta Brava.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you want to view the mysterious underwater world but don\'t want to get your feet wet, a glass-bottom boat or \"submarine\" is the ticket. You can also fish, sail, jet-ski, or parasail.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Since the beaches along the Zona Hotelera can have a strong undertow, you should always respect the flags posted in the area. A black flag means you cannot swim at all. A red flag means you can swim but only with extreme caution. Yellow means approach with caution, while green means water conditions are safe. You will seldom see the green flag-even when the water is calm-so swim cautiously, and don\'t assume you\'re immune to riptides because you\'re on vacation. At least one tourist drowns per season after ignoring the flags.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Unfortunately, Laguna Nichupté has become polluted from illegal dumping of sewage and at times can have a strong smell. In 1993 the city began conducting a clean-up campaign that included handing out fines to offenders, so the quality of the water is slowly improving. There is very little wildlife to see in the lagoon, so most advertised jungle tours are glorified jet-ski romps where you drive around fast, make a lot of noise, and don\'t see many animals. American crocodiles still reside in these waters though, so do not stand or swim in the lagoon.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although the coral reef in this area is not as spectacular as farther south, there is still plenty to see, with more than 500 species of sea life in the waters. It is actually quite common to see angelfish, parrotfish, blue tang, and the occasional moray eel. But the corals in this area are extremely fragile and currently endangered. To be a good world citizen, follow the six golden rules for snorkeling or scuba diving:</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">1. Don\'t throw any garbage into the sea, as the marine life will assume it is food, an often lethal mistake.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">2. Never stand on the coral.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">3. Secure all cameras and gear onto your body so you don\'t drop anything onto the fragile reef.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">4. Never take anything from the sea.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">5. Don\'t feed any of the marine animals.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">6. Avoid sunblock or tanning lotion just before you visit the reef.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

June and September are the best months to be in the region, as both are free of the midsummer crowds and the weather is summer-balmy. June offers the advantage of long daylight hours, although cheaper prices and many warm days, often lasting well into October, make September attractive. Try to avoid the second half of July and all of August, when almost all of France goes on vacation. Huge crowds jam the roads and beaches, and prices are jacked up in resorts. Don\'t travel on or around July 14 and August 1, 15, and 31, when every French family is either going on vacation or driving home.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Watch out for May, riddled with church holidays—one a week—and the museum closings they entail. Anytime between March and November will offer you a good chance to soak up the sun on the Côte d\'Azur. After All Saints (November 1) the whole region begins to shutter down for winter, and won\'t open its main resort hotels until Easter. Still, off-season has its charms—the pétanque games are truly just the town folks\' game, the most touristy hill towns are virtually abandoned, and when it\'s nice out—more often than not—you can bask in direct sun in the cafés.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Top 10 Reasons to Go to the French Riviera</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Eastern Riviera</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Monaco, toy kingdom:</b> Yes, Virginia, you can afford to visit Monte Carlo—that is, if you avoid its casinos and head instead for its magnificent tropical gardens.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Picasso &amp; Company:</b> Because artists have long loved the Côte d\'Azur, it is blessed with superb art museums, including the Fondation Maeght in St-Paul and the Musée Picasso in Antibes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Èze, island in the sky:</b> The most perfectly perched of the coast\'s <i>villages perchés,</i> Èze has some of the most breathtaking views this isde of a NASA space capsule.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Nice, Queen of the Riviera:</b> With its bonbon-colored palaces, blue Baie des Anges, time-stained Old Town, and Musée Matisse, this is one of France\'s most colorful cities.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Sunkissed Cap d\'Antibes:</b> Bordering well-hidden mansions and zillion-dollar hotels, the Sentier Tirepoil is a spectacular footpath along the sea.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Western Riviera</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>St-Tropez à go-go:</b> Brave the world\'s most outlandish fishing port in high summer and soak up the scene.

Located a kilometer (½ mi) outside the village, Fondation Maeght is a temple of 20th-century art founded in 1964 by celebrated art dealer Aimé Maeght. Set on a wooded cliff top high above the medieval town, the museum is an extraordinary marriage of the arc-and-plane architecture of José Maria Sert; the looming sculptures of Miró and Moore; and its humbling setting of pines, vines, and flowing planes of water. On display is an intriguing and ever-varying collection of the work of modern masters, including the wise and funny late-life masterwork <i>La Vie</i> (<i>Life</i>) by Chagall. Giacometti\'s figures stride the courtyards, Miró\'s <i>Egg</i> emerges from the pool, while mobiles by Calder and Arp shift in the breeze. Inside, the multilevel, light-filled museum displays an ever-changing feast of works by Braque, Léger, Dubuffet, and other masters of 20th-century art.

Matisse settled in Nice in 1917, seeking a sun cure after a bout with pneumonia, and remained here until his death in 1954. During his years on the Côte d\'Azur, Matisse maintained intense friendships and artistic liaisons with Renoir, who lived in Cagnes, and with Picasso, who lived in Mougins and Antibes. Settling first along the waterfront, he eventually moved up to the rarified isolation of Cimiez and took an apartment in the Hotel Regina (now an apartment building), where he lived out the rest of his life. Matisse walked often in the parklands around the Roman remains and was buried in an olive grove outside the Cimiez Cemetery. The collection of artworks includes several pieces donated to the city by the artist himself before his death; the rest was donated by his family. In every medium and context—paintings, gouache cut-outs, engravings, and book illustrations—it represents the evolution of his art, from Cézanne-like still lifes to exuberant dancing paper dolls. Even the furniture and decorations speak of Matisse, from the Chinese vases to the bold-printed fabrics with which he surrounded himself. A series of black-and-white photographs captures the artist at work, surrounded by personal—and telling—details. COST: EUR 4.

Surfers in the know head to \"the poles\" for the best wave action in town. The park includes nearly 300 campsites and cabins with fees ranging from $20 to $34 per day. COST: $3 per vehicle. OPEN: Apr.-Oct., daily 8-8; Nov.-Mar., daily 8-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This must-see attraction, just southeast of Titusville, is one of Central Florida\'s most popular sights. Located on a 140,000-acre island 45 minutes outside Orlando, Kennedy Space Center is NASA\'s launch headquarters, where the space shuttle is prepared for flight, launched into space, and returns after its mission. The Visitor Complex gives guests a unique opportunity to learn about—and experience—the past, present, and future of America\'s space program.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Interactive programs make for the best experiences here, but if you want a low-key overview of the facility (and if the weather is foul) take the bus tour, included with admission. Buses depart every 15 minutes, and you can get on and off any bus whenever you like. Stops include the <b>Launch Complex 39 Observation Gantry,</b> which has an unparalleled view of the twin space-shuttle launchpads; the <b>Apollo/Saturn V Center,</b> with a don\'t-miss presentation at the Firing Room Theatre, where the launch of America\'s first lunar mission, 1968\'s <i>Apollo VIII</i>, is re-created with a ground-shaking, window-rattling liftoff; and the <b>International Space Station Center,</b> where NASA is building pieces of the space station; a mock-up of a \"Habitation Module\" is worth seeing.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Exhibits near the center\'s entrance include the <b>Early Space Exploration</b> display, which highlights the rudimentary yet influential <i>Mercury</i>and <i>Gemini</i>space programs; <b>Robot Scouts,</b> a walk-through exhibit of unmanned planetary probes; and the <b>Exploration in the New Millennium</b> display, which offers you the opportunity to touch a piece of Mars (it fell to the Earth in the form of meteorite). Don\'t miss the outdoor <b>Rocket Garden,</b> with walkways winding beside spare rockets, from early Atlas spacecraft to a <i>Saturn IB</i>. The redeveloped Children\'s Playdome enables kids to play among the next generation of spacecraft, climb a moon-rock wall, and crawl through rocket tunnels. Astronaut Encounter Theater has two daily programs where NASA astronaut corps share their adventures in space travel and show a short film. The most moving exhibit is the <b>Astronaut Memorial.</b> The 70,400-pound black-granite tribute to astronauts who lost their lives in the name of space exploration stands 42½ feet high by 50 feet wide.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">More befitting Walt Disney World or Universal Studios (complete with the health warnings), the <b>Shuttle Launch Experience</b> is the center\'s newest and most spectacular attraction. Designed by a team of astronauts, NASA experts, and renowned attraction engineers, the 44,000-square-foot structure uses a sophisticated motion-based platform, special-effects seats, and high-fidelity visual and audio components to simulate the sensations experienced in an actual space-shuttle launch, including MaxQ, Solid Rocker Booster separation, main engine cutoff, and External Tank separation. The journey culminates with a breathtaking view of Earth from space.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The only back-to-back twin <b>IMAX theater</b> in the world is in the complex, too. The dream of space flight comes to life on a movie screen five stories tall with dramatic footage shot by NASA astronauts during missions. Realistic 3-D special effects will make you feel like you\'re in space with them. Films alternate throughout the year. Call for specific shows and times.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Add-on activities include <b>Lunch with an Astronaut</b> ($60.99, includes general admission), where astronauts talk about their experiences and engage in a good-natured Q&amp;A; the typical line of questioning from kids—\"How do you eat/sleep/relieve yourself in space?\" NASA <b>Up Close</b> tour ($59, general admission included) brings visitors to sites seldom accessible to the public, such as the Vehicle Assembly Building, the shuttle landing strip, and the 6-million-pound crawler that transports the shuttle to its launchpad. Or see how far the space program has come with the <b>Cape Canaveral: Then and Now</b> tour ($59, includes general admission), which visits America\'s first launch sites from the 1960s and the 21st century\'s active unmanned-rocket program. www.kennedyspacecenter.com. COST: General admission includes bus tour, IMAX movies, Visitor Complex shows and exhibits, and the Astronaut Hall of Fame, $38. OPEN: Space Center opens daily at 9, closing times vary according to season (call for details), last regular tour 3 hrs before closing; closed certain launch dates. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In this loftlike downtown building, the former headquarters of the Western Union Telegraph Company, a permanent collection of 20th-century art shares space with traveling exhibitions. The museum encompasses five galleries and ArtExplorium, a highly interactive educational exhibit for kids, as well as a funky gift shop and Café Nola, open for lunch on weekdays and for dinner on Thursday and Friday. MOCA Jacksonville (previously known as the Jacksonville Museum of Modern Art) also hosts film series, lectures, and workshops throughout the year. Big-city visitors often remark that they\'re impressed with the facility and exhibitions, but with MOCA Jacksonville comprising just 14,000 square feet (compared with the 630,000 at New York\'s Museum of Modern Art), they wonder where the rest is. Sunday is free for kids and their accompanying adults. www.mocajacksonville.org. COST: $8. OPEN: Tues., Wed., Fri., and Sat. 10-4, Thurs. 10-8, Sun. noon-4; hrs subject to change. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It might be more laid-back than Johannesburg, but it has shaken off its sleepy, parochial air and now bristles with world-class shops and restaurants and cutting-edge art and design.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Lofty Aspirations</b> Fantastic Table Mountain towers over Cape Town and dominates the whole peninsula. Exploring the mountain is a must; you can either take the cable car to the top or hike up various routes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Nature\'s Playground</b> Capetonians are proud of their city\'s stylish good looks and make the most of the mountain and beaches. You can take advantage of the area\'s natural beauty and follow their lead. In summer you\'ll find lots of professionals shrugging off their suits as they head for the beach after work with their surfboards, picnics, and sundowners. In winter they bundle up against the cold and go walking, mountain biking, or running in one of the city\'s many green spaces.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>To Market, To Market</b> Cape Town\'s markets are the best in the country—informal, creative, artistic, and with a good selection of both tacky and splendid African curios.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Historical Heritage</b> Cape Town is saturated with an extremely rich and fascinating history. At Robben Island you can stand in Mandela\'s old cell and learn about political and social banishment during apartheid, while the District Six Museum tells the poignant tale of the destruction of one of the country\'s most vibrant inner-city neighborhoods.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Great Itineraries</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>3 Days:</b> With three days you can manage to see many of the city\'s major sights—including Company\'s Gardens, Castle of Good Hope, District Six Museum, and the Bo-Kaap—on your own or with a tour. Weather permitting, try to also work in a Robben Island tour, which will take around 3½ hours, and lunch at one of the outdoor restaurants at the V&amp;A Waterfront, where you can eat while watching working tugboats maneuver past sleek million-dollar yachts. The cable-car ride to the summit of Table Mountain is a must; go in the morning, and in the afternoon, drive out to Camps Bay, where you can kick off your shoes to stroll along the beach. To round out the evening, find a sophisticated sea-facing bar for a drink before going on to dinner. On another evening, discover the rhythm of Africa by heading to the Green Dolphin at the V&amp;A Waterfront, where you can listen to terrific jazz. Or for a real taste of contemporary African music, go to Mama Africa for pulsing marimba music.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>5 or More Days:</b> With at least five days, you can enjoy all the sights listed above as well as a trip to the Winelands in Constantia, Stellenbosch, Franschhoek, and Paarl. From the harbor you can take a cruise to Seal Island or, for a more adventurous activity, admire the sunset from the back of a horse at Noordhoek. Wend your way along the False Bay coast to Boulders Beach, in Table Mountain National Park, where you\'ll find African penguins in profusion. From here, follow the road to the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Point. You can take the steep walk to the point or take the funicular. It looks as if this is where the Indian and Atlantic oceans meet—sometimes there is even a line of foam stretching out to sea—but of course it\'s not. (That happens at Cape Agulhas, on the Cape\'s southern coast.) For a late lunch make your way back to the pretty fishing village of Kalk Bay, where the streets are lined with antiques shops and there are plenty of excellent restaurants to relax in. However you spend your time, on your last night back in Cape Town have a drink at the Bascule bar at the Cape Grace (at the V&amp;A Waterfront) and watch the gulls wheel overhead against a backdrop of Table Mountain.

An excellent example of contemporary South African art is the ghoulish sculpture <i>The Butcher Boys,</i> by Jane Alexander. Walk around these three sitting figures with an air of foreboding and menace about them, and you\'ll be shocked to discover their exposed spines. This is the stuff of nightmares, recalling the torture activists suffered at the hands of the security police during the height of apartheid. The gallery owns an enormous body of work, so exhibitions change regularly, but there\'s always something provocative—whether it\'s documentary photographs or a multimedia exhibit chronicling South Africa\'s struggles with HIV and AIDS. The director, Marilyn Martin, is known for innovative, brave, and sometimes controversial exhibitions and her outspoken stance on art policy and development. Free guided tours on Tuesday and Thursday take about an hour. www.museums.org.za/sang. COST: R10. OPEN: Tues.-Sun. 10-5; tours Tues. and Thurs. at 11 and 1. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Robben Island</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Made famous by its most illustrious inhabitant, Nelson Mandela, this island, whose name is Dutch for \"seals,\" has a long and sad history. At various times a prison, leper colony, mental institution, and military base, it is finally filling a positive, enlightening, and empowering role in its latest incarnation as a museum. Robert Sobukwe and Walter Sisulu were also imprisoned here for their role in opposing apartheid. For many years the African National Congress secretary-general, Sisulu died in 2003 in his early nineties and was given a hero\'s burial. Sobukwe, founding president of the Pan Africanist Congress, proved to be such a thorn in the government\'s side that he was imprisoned in the 1960s under the special Sobukwe Clause, which had to be renewed every year to keep him in jail. John Voster, then the country\'s minister, said of Sobukwe, \"He is a man with magnetic personality, great organizing ability, and a divine sense of mission,\" and it was these very qualities that made him such a threat. He was treated slightly better than other prisoners but was kept completely isolated from them—an especially terrible punishment for a man with such a strong sense of community. In addition to these more recent prisoners, there have been some fascinating (and reluctant) inhabitants of this at once formidable and beautiful place. One of the first prisoners was Autshumato, known to the early Dutch settlers as Harry the Hottentot. He was one of the main interpreters for Jan van Riebeeck in the mid-17th century, and was imprisoned for opposing British colonial rule, as was his niece Krotoa. In 1820 the British thought they could solve some of the problems they were having on the Eastern Cape frontier by banishing Xhosa leader Makhanda to the island. Both Autshumato and Makhanda (also spelled Makana) escaped by rowboat, but Makhanda didn\'t make it.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Declared a World Heritage site on December 1, 1997, Robben Island has become a symbol of the triumph of the human spirit. In 1997 around 90,000 made the pilgrimage; in 2006 more than 300,000 crossed the water to see where some of the greatest South Africans spent much of their lives. Visiting the island is a sobering experience, which begins at the modern Nelson Mandela Gateway to Robben Island, an impressive embarkation center that doubles as a conference center. Interactive exhibits display historic photos of prison life. Next make the journey across the water, remembering to watch Table Mountain recede in the distance and imagine what it must have been like to have just received a 20-year jail sentence. Boats leave on the hour, and the crossing takes 30 minutes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tours are organized by the Robben Island Museum. (Other operators advertise Robben Island tours but just take visitors on a boat trip <i>around</i> the island.) As a result of the reconciliation process, most tour guides are former political prisoners. During the 2½-hour tour you walk through the prison and see the cells where Mandela and other leaders were imprisoned. You also tour the lime quarry, where Mandela spent so many years pounding rocks; in summer the reflection off the rock is blinding, and Mandela\'s eyesight—but thankfully not his insight—was irreparably damaged by the glare. The tour also takes you past Robert Sobukwe\'s house and the leper church. Many of the prison buildings have been renovated, but there are also plans to upgrade unoccupied houses where the wardens used to live, extend the harbor, and make the island more wheelchair-friendly. It can get pretty crowded, so reserve in advance, and take sunglasses and a hat in summer. You are advised to tip your guide only if you feel that the tour has been informative. www.robben-island.org.za. COST: R150.

In the late 16th century, Le Clerc holed up on Pigeon Island, just off the island\'s northernmost point, and used it as a staging ground for attacking passing ships. Now Pigeon Island is a national park, a playground for locals and visitors alike, and, as mentioned, the most popular performance venue for the annual St. Lucia Jazz Festival. Several years ago, a man-made causeway attached Pigeon Island to the mainland; today, Sandals Grande St. Lucian Spa &amp; Beach Resort, one of the largest resorts in St. Lucia, and The Landings, a luxury villa community that opened in 2008, are sprawled along that causeway.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Like most of its Caribbean neighbors, St. Lucia was first inhabited by the Arawaks and then the Carib Indians. British settlers attempted to colonize the island twice in the early 1600s, but it wasn\'t until 1651, after the French West India Company secured the island from the Caribs, that Europeans gained a foothold. For 150 years, battles for island possession were frequent between the French and the British, with a dizzying 14 changes in power before the British finally took possession in 1814. The Europeans established sugar plantations, using slaves from West Africa to work the fields. By 1838, when the slaves were emancipated, more than 90% of the population was of African descent—also the approximate proportion of today\'s 170,000 St. Lucians. Indentured East Indian laborers were brought over in 1882 to help bail out the sugar industry, which collapsed when slavery was abolished and all but died in the 1960s, when bananas became the major crop.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On February 22, 1979, St. Lucia became an independent state within the British Commonwealth of Nations, with a resident governor-general appointed by the queen. Still, the island appears to have retained more relics of French influence—notably the island patois, cuisine, village names, and surnames—than of the British. Most likely, that\'s because the British contribution primarily involved the English language, the educational and legal systems, and the political structure, while the French culture historically had more impact on the arts—music, dance, and all that jazz!</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Embracing Kwéyòl</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">English is St. Lucia\'s official language, but most St. Lucians speak and often use Kwéyòl—a French-based Creole language—for informal conversations between and among themselves. Primarily a spoken language, Kwéyòl in its written version doesn\'t look at all like French; pronounce the words phonetically, though—<i>entenasyonnal</i> (international), for example, or the word <i>Kwéyòl</i> (Creole) itself—and you indeed sound as if you\'re speaking French.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pretty much the same version of the Creole language, or patois, is spoken in the nearby island of Dominica. Otherwise, the St. Lucian Kwéyòl is quite different from that spoken in other Caribbean islands with a French and African heritage, such as Haiti, Guadeloupe, and Martinique—or elsewhere, such as Louisiana, Mauritius, and Madagascar. Interestingly, the Kwéyòl spoken in St. Lucia and Dominica is mostly unintelligible to people from those other locations—and vice versa.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">St. Lucia embraces its Creole heritage by devoting the month of October each year to celebrations that preserve and promote Creole culture, language, and traditions. In selected communities throughout the island, events and performances highlight Creole music, food, dance, theater, native costumes, church services, traditional games, folklore, native medicine—a little bit of everything, or <i>tout bagay,</i> as you say in Kwéyòl!</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Creole Heritage Month culminates at the end of October with all-day events and activities on Jounen Kwéyòl Entenasyonnal, or International Creole Day, which is recognized by all countries that speak a version of the Creole language.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The <b>BB&amp;T Charleston Food + Wine Festival</b> (tel. 843/763-0280 or 866/369-3378. www.charlestonfoodandwine.com) allows the city to \"strut its stuff\" at an annual festival in Marion Square in early March. Some of the most sought-after events sell out early, such as the Restaurant Dine-Around with celebrity chefs, and the Saturday Night Celebration with incredible food stations and live music.

The <b>Fall Tours of Homes and Gardens</b> (tel. 843/722-4630. www.preservationsociety.org), sponsored by the Preservation Society of Charleston in September and October, provides an inside look at Charleston\'s private buildings and gardens. More than 100 private homes, gardens, and historic churches are open to the public for tours during the <b>Festival of Houses and Gardens</b> (tel. 843/722-3405. www.historiccharleston.org), held during March and April each year.

There are hundreds of events—from jazz performances to puppet shows and expansive art shows in Marion Square—from mid-May through early June, and many of the performances are free.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Charleston Preserved</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\'s easy to think Charleston is a neverland, sweetly arrested in pastel perfection. But look at Civil War-era images of the Battery mansions on East Bay Street, one of the most photographed areas in town today, and you see the surrounding homes disfigured with crippling battle scars. Because of the poverty that followed the Civil War, on the whole locals simply couldn\'t afford to build anew from the late 1860s through the early part of the 20th century, so they put the homes they had back together.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the 1920s it was community activism that rescued the old homes from being destroyed. According to Jonathan Poston, author of <i>Buildings of Charleston,</i> the preservation movement began when an Esso gas station was slated to take the place of the Joseph Manigault House. Citizens formed the Society for the Preservation of Old Dwellings (the first such group in the nation) and saved what\'s now a popular house museum. By 1931 Charleston\'s City Council had created the Board of Architectural Review (BAR), and designated the historic district protected from unrestrained development—two more national firsts. The Historic Charleston Foundation was established in 1947, and preservation is now second nature (by law).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As you explore, look for Charleston single houses: just one room wide, these houses were built with the narrow end streetside and multistory south or southwestern porches (often called piazzas) to catch prevailing breezes. Cool air drifts across these shaded porches, entering houses through open windows.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You\'ll see numerous architectural vestiges along Charleston\'s preserved streets. Many houses have plaques detailing their history, and others have Carolopolis Awards given for fine restoration work. Old fire-insurance plaques are more rare; they denote the company that insured the home and that would extinguish the flames if a fire broke out. Notice the bolt heads and washers that dot house facades along the Battery; some are in the shape of circles or stars, and others are capped with lion heads. These could straighten sagging houses when tightened via a crank under the floorboards.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Note the iron spikes that line the tops of some residential gates, doors, walls, and windows. Serving the same purpose as razor wire atop prison fences, most of these <i>cheveux de frise</i> (French for frizzy hair) were added after a thwarted 1822 slave rebellion, to deter break-in—or escape.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

As unpleasant as the slavery existence must have been, its history is vital, but not proud. Charleston once served as the center of commercial activity for the South\'s plantation economy, and slaves were the primary source of labor both within the city and on the surrounding plantations.

Say \"barbecue.\" Barbecue has been called \"the most Southern meal of all.\" But just as there are myriad Southern accents, there are many types of barbecue. Understanding the distinctions is key to understanding a culinary and cultural phenomenon in North Carolina, where barbecue begins with pork (banish all thoughts of beef) and is not so much a verb as a noun (that is, a dish or an event known as a pig-pickin\').</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The state\'s barbecue tradition, variously linked to the cooking techniques of Native Americans, African slaves, and Scottish-Irish settlers, has been immortalized in song, prose, poetry, and the electronic media. So revered is the moist and tangy meat that it has inspired place names such as Barbecue Presbyterian Church, which rises beside Barbecue Creek in the Piedmont\'s Harnett County. Versions of it are served in eateries ranging from top-drawer to lunch counter, though many argue the most authentic barbecue is found in small-town cinder-block restaurants with on-site smokehouses.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">And right there is the, ah, meat of the matter: taste. The method of cooking the meat and the ingredients of the sauce that coats it spark a passion that cuts across lines of age, class, and race. One hundred years or more of tradition have dictated that either whole hogs or shoulders be slow-roasted over a wood or charcoal fire to imbue the meat with an appropriate smoky flavor. Over the past few decades, however, an increasing number of barbecuers have switched to cleaner propane flames.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The real fault line, though, is geography. In eastern North Carolina (that\'s east of Interstate 95) the entire hog is cooked and the meat is \"pulled\" (off the bone) or coarsely chopped and then heavily seasoned with a vinegar-and-pepper-based sauce. This concoction, whose exact ingredients are jealously guarded by each owner, has a definite kick. West of Interstate 85, the meat, which usually includes just the pork shoulders, can be sliced or chopped. It\'s then mixed with a somewhat sweeter sauce made of vinegar, ketchup, brown sugar, and perhaps Worcestershire sauce. Serving as a buffer between these two regions is the Research Triangle area, where you\'ll find both types of barbecue.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">No matter where North Carolinians stand on the barbecue debate, both sides agree that the line of good taste has to be drawn somewhere. In this case, it\'s at the mustardy sauce used in the state just south of the border.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The diversity of cultures you find here today is hardly surprising, since the ancestors of today\'s Northern Thai people came from China, and the point where they first crossed the mighty Mekong River, Chiang Saen, became a citadel-kingdom of its own as early as 773. Nearly half a millennium passed before the arrival of a king who was able to unite the citizens of the new realm of Lanna (\"a thousand rice fields\").</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The fabled ruler King Mengrai (1259-1317) also established a dynasty that lasted two centuries. Mengrai\'s first capital was Chiang Rai, but at the end of the 13th century he moved his court south and in 1296 founded a new dynastic city, Chiang Mai. Two friendly rulers, King Ngarm Muang of Phayao and King Rama Kampeng of Sukhothai, helped him in the huge enterprise, and the trio sealed their alliance in blood, drinking from a chalice filled from their slit wrists. A monument outside the city museum in the center of Chiang Mai\'s Old City commemorates the event. Nearby, another monument marks the spot where King Mengrai died, in 1317, after being struck by lightning in one of the fierce storms that regularly roll down from the nearby mountains.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lanna power was weakened by waves of attacks by Burmese and Lao invaders, and for two centuries—from 1556 to the late 1700s—Lanna was virtually a vassal Burmese state. The capital was moved south to Lampang, where Burmese power was finally broken and a new Lanna dynasty, the Chakri, was established under King Rama I.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chiang Mai, nearby Lamphun (also at the center of Lanna-Burmese struggles), and Lampang are full of reminders of this rich history. Lampang\'s fortified Wat Lampang Luang commemorates with an ancient bullet hole the spot where the commander of besieging Burmese forces was killed.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the north is Chiang Rai, a regal capital 30 years before Chiang Mai was built. This quieter, less-developed town is slowly becoming a base for exploring the country\'s northernmost reaches. In the far north, the Chiang Saen, site of the region\'s first true kingdom, is being excavated, its 1,000-year-old walls slowly taking shape again. Chiang Saen is on the edge of the fabled Golden Triangle. This mountainous region, bordered by Myanmar to the west and Laos to the east, was once ruled by the opium warlord Khun Sa, whose hometown, Ban Sop Ruak, has a magnificent museum, the Hall of Opium, that traces the story of the spread of narcotics.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai are ideal bases for exploring the hill-tribe villages, where people live as they have for centuries. The communities closest to the two cities have been overrun by tourists, but if you strike out on your own with a good map you may still find some that haven\'t become theme parks. Most of the villages are bustling crafts centers where the colorful fabrics you see displayed in Bangkok shop windows take shape before your eyes. The elaborately costumed villagers descend into Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai every evening to sell their wares in the night markets that transform thoroughfares into tented bazaars.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Temple Know-How</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most temple complexes open about 6 AM and don\'t close until 6 or 8 PM, although the hours can be irregular and the doors may be locked for no reason. If that\'s the case, approach any monk and explain you\'d like to visit. He\'ll normally open up the temple. There\'s no admission charge, but leave some change in one of the collection boxes. (By making a donation you\'re also \"making merit\" and easing your journey to the hereafter.) In some temples, caged birds are for sale—you\'re expected to set them free, another means of making merit.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It\'s an economically constructed temple, combining the main shrine hall and viharn, and qualifies as one of Northern Thailand\'s best examples of folk architecture. To enter, you climb a short flight of steps flanked by two superb nagas, their heads guarding the north entrance and their tails the south. The 16th-century temple was extensively renovated in 1865 and 1873, and at the end of the 19th century murals picturing everyday life were added to the inner walls. Some have a unique historical context—like the French colonial soldiers disembarking at a Mekong River port with their wives in crinolines. A fully rigged merchant ship and a primitive steamboat are portrayed as backdrops to scenes showing colonial soldiers leering at the pretty local girls corralled in a palace courtyard. Even the conventional Buddhist images have a lively originality, ranging from the traumas of hell to the joys of courtly life. The bot\'s central images are also quite unusual—four Sukhothai Buddhas locked in conflict with the evil Mara. OPEN: Daily 8-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wat Phra That Lampang Luang</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Near the village of Ko Khang is Wat Phra That Lampang Luang, one of the most venerated temples in the north. It\'s also one of the most striking. Surrounded by stout laterite defense walls, the temple has the appearance of a fortress—and that\'s exactly what it was when the legendary Queen Chamthewi founded her capital here in the 8th century. The Burmese captured it two centuries ago, but were ejected by the forces of a Lampang prince (a bullet hole marks the spot where he killed the Burmese commander). The sandy temple compound has much to hold your interest, including a tiny chapel with a hole in the door that creates an amazing, inverted photographic image of the Wat\'s central, gold-covered chedi. The temple\'s ancient viharn has a beautifully carved wooden facade; note the painstaking workmanship of the intricate decorations around the porticoes. A museum has excellent woodcarvings, but its treasure is a small emerald Buddha, which some claim was carved from the same stone as its counterpart in Bangkok. OPEN: Tues.-Sun. 9-4. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wat Phra That Hariphunchai</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The temple complex of Wat Phra That Hariphunchai is dazzling. Through the gates guarded by ornamental lions is a three-tier, sloping-roof viharn, a replica of the original that burned down in 1915. Inside, note the large Chiang Saen-style bronze image of the Buddha and the carved <i>thammas</i> (Buddhism\'s universal principals) to the left of the altar. As you leave the viharn, you pass what is reputedly the largest bronze gong in the world, cast in 1860. The 165-foot Suwana chedi, covered in copper and topped by a golden spire, dates from 847. A century later, King Athitayarat, the 32nd ruler of Hariphunchai, added a nine-tier umbrella, gilded with 14 pounds of gold. At the back of the compound—where you can find a shortcut to the center of town—there\'s another viharn with a standing Buddha, a sala housing four Buddha footprints, and the old museum. OPEN: Wed.-Sun. 8:30-4. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wat Phra That Doi Suthep</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As in so many chapters of Thai history, an elephant is closely involved in the legend surrounding the foundation of Wat Phra That, Northern Thailand\'s most revered temple and one of only a few enjoying royal patronage. The elephant was dispatched from Chiang Mai carrying religious relics from Wat Suan Dok. Instead of ambling off into the open countryside, it stubbornly climbed up Doi Suthep. When the elephant came to rest at the 3,542-foot summit, the decision was made to establish a temple to contain the relics at that site. Over the centuries the temple compound grew into the glittering assembly of chedis, bots, viharns, and frescoed cloisters you see today. The vast terrace, usually smothered with flowers, commands a breathtaking view of Chiang Mai. Constructing the temple was quite a feat—until 1935 there was no paved road to the temple. Workers and pilgrims alike had to slog through thick jungle. The road was the result of a vast community project: individual villages throughout the Chiang Mai region contributed the labor, each laying 1,300-foot sections.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You can find songthaews to take you on the 30-minute drive to this temple at Chuang Puak Gate, the Central Department Store on Huay Kaew Road, or outside the entrance to Wat Phra Singh. When you arrive, you are faced with an arduous but exhilarating climb up the broad, 304-step staircase flanked by 16th-century tiled balustrades that take the customary form of <i>nagas</i>(mythical snakes believed to control the irrigation waters in rice fields). A funicular railway provides a much easier way to the top. But the true pilgrim\'s way is up the majestic steps. COST: B70 (includes funicular). OPEN: Daily 6-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wat Chedi Luang</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1411 King Saen Muang Ma ordered his workers to build a chedi \"as high as a dove could fly.\" He died before the structure was finished, as did the next king. During the reign of the following king, an earthquake knocked down about a third of the 282-foot spire, and it\'s now a superb ruin. The parklike grounds contain a variety of assembly halls, chapels, a 30-foot-long reclining Buddha, and the ancient city pillar. The main assembly hall, a vast, pillared building guarded by two nagas (mythical snakes believed to control the irrigation waters in rice fields), has been restored and was reopened to the public in 2008. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hall of Opium</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Opened in 2004, the magnificent Hall of Opium is a dazzling white stucco, glass, marble, and aluminum building nestling in a valley above the Mekong. The site of the museum is so close to former poppy fields that a plan is still being considered to extend the complex to encompass an \"open-air\" exhibit of a functioning opium plantation. The museum traces the history of the entire drug trade (including a look at how mild stimulants like coffee and tea took hold in the West). It even attempts to give visitors a taste of the \"opium experience\" by leading them through a 500-foot-long tunnel where synthetic aroma traces of the drug and atmospheric music waft between walls bearing phantasmagoric bas-relief scenes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The entrance tunnel emerges into a gallery of blinding light, where the nature of the opium-producing poppy is vividly described on an information panel erected in front of an imitation field of the insidiously beautiful flower. It\'s an arresting introduction to an imaginatively designed and assembled exhibition, which reaches back into the murky history of the opium trade and takes a long, monitory look into a potentially even darker future. The Hall of Opium is so large in scope and scale that two days are hardly enough to take it all in. A visit is ideally combined with an overnight stay at one of two hotels within walking distance: the Hall\'s own Greater Mekong Lodge (double rooms from B1,800 including breakfast) or, for a sheer splurge, at the luxurious Anantara, just across the road. www.maefahluang.org.

At the top, interactive exhibits tell about Chicago\'s dreamers, schemers, architects, musicians, writers, and sports stars. Kids love Knee-High Chicago, a 4-foot-high exhibit that has cutouts of Chicago sports, history, and cultural icons at a child\'s eye-level. Security is very tight, so figure in a little extra time for your visit to the Skydeck.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">John Hancock Center Observatory</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The third-tallest building in Chicago has the most impressive panoramic views of the lake and surrounding skyline—it\'s high enough to see the tops of neighboring buildings in vivid 3-D, but not so remote that you feel like you\'re looking out from a plane. Our tip? Skip the observatory and head to the bar that adjoins the Signature Room restaurant on the 95th floor—you\'ll spend your money on an exorbitantly priced cocktail instead of the entrance fee and enjoy the same view. Women can head to the 95th-floor ladies\' room for the best view in the whole building.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping on the Magnificent Mile</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Exclusive shops, department stores, and boutiques line the northern half of swanky Michigan Avenue. Even better, the concentration of prestigious stores in vertical malls means you can get a lot of shopping done in winter without venturing into the bluster outside.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Blues Scene</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Explore jumping North Side clubs, like Kingston Mines, or South Side venues like the Checkerboard or Lee\'s Unleaded Blues (where greats like Muddy Waters and Buddy Guy first honed their talent) for the sound Chicago gave birth to—the scintillating electric blues. If you\'re here in June, don\'t miss the Chicago Blues Festival, which packs in fans every summer.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Navy Pier</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Yes, it\'s a little schlocky, but Navy Pier is fun, especially for families. Everyone can fan out to shop in the mall, play 18-hole minigolf in Pier Park in the summer, see a movie at the IMAX Theater, or explore the Chicago Children\'s Museum. Plus, there\'s a stained-glass museum, a funhouse maze with scenes of Chicago landmarks, and an old-fashioned swing ride. Meet up later at the Ferris wheel for a photo op or just settle on the pier with a drink and enjoy the view.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art Institute of Chicago</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This Chicago cultural gem has the country\'s best collection of Impressionist and Postimpressionist art, as well as the brand-new Renzo Piano-designed modern wing. It\'s also a great place to see all those paintings you\'ve only seen on postcards, like <i>American Gothic</i> and <i>Nighthawks.</i></div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">How can you not enjoy getting up close with the cosmos at the country\'s oldest planetarium? Older children and astronomy fanatics get geeked about the interactive science exhibits and the high-tech Sky Pavilion, while younger visitors set their sights on virtual-reality shows in the StarRider Theater.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Field Museum</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Say hello to Sue, the Field\'s beloved gigantic T. rex, before immersing yourself in this extraordinary museum\'s collection of anthropological and paleontological artifacts and animal dioramas. The dinosaurs are the thing here, but surprising collections like Tibetan Buddhist altars, mummies, and re-creations of famous gems may entice you to linger for hours.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museum of Science and Industry</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Travel down an elevator shaft to a \"working\" coal mine, stroll the cobblestone streets of Chicago circa 1910, explore the caves of a human heart, or watch quietly as a baby chick pecks its way out of its shell at this endlessly interactive museum.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shedd Aquarium</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">We find the experience of watching entire universities—not just schools—of fantastically colored fish, as well as dolphins and whales, completely mesmerizing. Don\'t miss the Wild Reef exhibit, where stingrays slide quietly under the Plexiglas at your feet.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Frank Lloyd Wright Architecture</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Frank Lloyd Wright\'s Prairie School captured the flat, expansive Midwestern plains he saw around him. Oak Park, a Chicago suburb, has many fine examples, though one of the best is Robie House in Hyde Park, which is open for tours.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Millennium Park</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Make a beeline for Frank Gehry\'s <b>Jay Pritzker Pavilion,</b> where an incredible sound system allows audiences to enjoy concert-hall sound in the great outdoors. The <i>Bean</i> is a luminous polished-steel sculpture that plays tricks with the reflection of Chicago\'s skyline. In warmer months children of all ages can\'t resist a splash in the Crown Fountain, twin 50-foot towers that project close-up video images of Chicagoans \"spitting\" jets of water.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chicago Then and Now</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Early Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Before Chicago was officially \"discovered\" by the team of Father Jacques Marquette, a French missionary, and Louis Jolliet, a French-Canadian mapmaker and trader, in 1673, the area served as a center of trade and seasonal hunting grounds for several Native American tribes, including the Miamis, Illinois, and Pottawattomie. Villages kept close trading ties with the French, though scuffles with the Fox tribe kept the French influence at bay until 1779. That year, black French trader Jean Baptiste Point du Sable built a five-room \"mansion\" by the mouth of the Chicago River on the shore of Lake Michigan.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Great Fire</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city grew until 1871, when a fire in the barn of Catherine and Patrick O\'Leary spread across the city, killing hundreds. (Contrary to the legend, it was probably not started by a cow kicking over a lantern.) A recent drought coupled with crowded wooden buildings and wood-brick streets allowed the blaze to take hold quickly, destroying 18,000 structures within 36 hours.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Gangsters to the Great Migration</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">World War I (aka the Great War) changed the face of Chicago. Postwar—and especially during Prohibition (1920-33)—the Torrio-Capone organization expanded its gambling and liquor distribution operations, consolidating its power during the violent \"beer wars\" from 1924 to 1930. Hundreds of casualties include the seven victims of the infamous 1929 St. Valentine\'s Day Massacre. In 1934 the FBI gunned down bankrobber and \"Public Enemy No. 1\" John Dillinger outside the Biograph Theater on the North Side, now a theater venue and a Chicago landmark.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Great War also led to the Great Migration, when African-Americans from the South moved to the northern cities between 1916 and 1970. World War I slowed immigration from Europe, but increased jobs in Chicago\'s manufacturing industry. More than 500,000 African-Americans came to the city to find work, and by the mid-20th century African-Americans were a strong force in Chicago\'s political, economic, and cultural life.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mayor Daley and the Notorious 1968 Democratic Convention</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Daley dynasty began when Richard J. Daley became mayor in 1955. He was reelected five times and his son, Richard M. Daley, currently runs the city.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The first Mayor Daley redrew Chicago\'s landscape, overseeing the construction of O\'Hare International Airport, the expressway system, the University of Illinois at Chicago, and a towering skyline. He also helped John F. Kennedy get elected, thanks to his control of Chicago\'s Democratic party.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Despite these advances, Mayor Richard J. Daley is perhaps best known for his crackdown on student protesters during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Americans watched on their televisions as the Chicago police beat the city\'s youth with sticks and blinded them with tear gas. That incident, plus his \"shoot to kill\" order during the riots that followed the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and his use of public funds to build giant, disastrous public housing projects like Cabrini-Green, eventually led to the temporary dissolution of the Democratic machine in Chicago. After Daley\'s death, Chicago\'s first black—and beloved—mayor, Harold Washington, took office in 1983.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chicago Today</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The thriving commercial and financial \"City of Broad Shoulders\" is spiked with gorgeous architecture and set with cultural and recreational gems, including the Art Institute, Millennium Park, 250 theater companies, and 30 mi of shoreline. 2.8 million residents live within the city limits, and tens of thousands commute in from the surrounding (and ever-sprawling) suburbs to work downtown during the week. The current Mayor Daley gave downtown a makeover, adding wrought-iron street furniture, regular fireworks, planters of flowers, and Millennium Park. Daley\'s focus on eco-friendly building initiatives led to a green roof installed on City Hall, and his advocacy of bicycling has brought new bike paths and bike racks. And spectacular lights now brighten buildings along Michigan Avenue after dark. There are always controversies (recent updates to the El system have caused some delays and lots of grumbling), but most Chicagoans are proud to call the city home.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">When Not To Go To Chicago</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Here are some considerations if you\'re looking for headache-free travel.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many leisure travelers are fazed by Chicago\'s frigid winters and the somewhat rough conditions they can cause (slippery roads, delayed traffic, the very thought of schlepping around in big boots). So, while museums and performances are at their max during winter, it might not be the opportune time to travel stress-free.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Also be aware of the more than 1,000 conventions and trade shows scheduled throughout the year. The National Restaurant Association show in May; the Manufacturing Technology show in September; the Radiological Society of America show in late November; and the National Housewares Manufacturing show in January are among the biggest. Hotel rooms may be hard to come by—and tables at popular restaurants even harder.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Contact the Chicago Convention and Tourism Bureau at 877/CHICAGO (877/244-2246) for information on conventions, trade shows, and other travel concerns before you book your trip.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Proximity to McCormick Place, where most of Chicago\'s huge trade shows hunker down, is often a conventioneer\'s top priority, so most wind up staying in the Loop or South Loop, where hotels are just a five-minute cab ride away from the mammoth venue. In these neighborhoods accommodations tend to be older and somewhat less expensive—although there are certainly a few exceptions. Expect somewhat quiet nights in these parts; while the Loop boasts a revitalized theater district, come sundown there\'s a lot more revelry north of the Chicago River in the neighborhoods surrounding the Mag Mile. Vibrant Rush Street is the site of many bars, while River North has a high concentration of restaurants and nightclubs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A meeting or convention in Rosemont or a tight flight schedule should be the only reasons to consider an airport hotel. Prices at these properties are a bit lower, but the O\'Hare area is drab. Plus, trips from there to downtown may take an hour during rush hour, bad weather, or periods of heavy construction on the Kennedy Expressway.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The Institute is more than just a museum; in fact, it was originally founded by a small group of artists in 1866 as a school with an adjoining exhibition space. Famous alumni include political cartoonist Herblock and artists Grant Wood and Ed Paschke. Walt Disney and Georgia O\'Keeffe both took classes, but didn\'t graduate. The School of the Art Institute of Chicago, one of the finest art schools in the country, is across the street from the museum; occasionally there are lectures and discussions that are open to the public.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Art Institute is a complicated jumble of three difficult-to-navigate buildings-you can only change buildings on the first level of the museum, and the map the museum gives out isn\'t very helpful. On the lower level are textiles, decorative arts, the Thorne Miniature Room, and the Kraft Education Center. The first level includes the non-European galleries, contemporary art, and American art to 1890. The second level holds American art from 1900 to 1950, European art from all periods, and Impressionism.

The sprawling open space has 2,000 exhibits on three floors, with new exhibits being added constantly. The museum\'s high-tech interior is hidden by the Classical Revival exterior; it was designed in 1892 by D.H. Burnham &amp; Company as a temporary structure to house the Palace of Fine Arts for the World\'s Columbian Exposition. It\'s the fair\'s only surviving building. On a nice day, take a walk behind the museum to the beautifully landscaped Jackson Park and its peaceful Osaka Garden, a Japanese-style garden with a waterfall.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Highlights</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Descend into the depths of a simulated coal mine</b> on a \"miner\"-led tour that explores the technology behind digging energy out of the ground.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The opulent and detailed-as-a-film-set Fairy Castle</b> (really a giant dollhouse) has tiny chandeliers that flash with real diamonds and floors that are laid with intricate stone patterns.

Richardson, who also designed Boston\'s Trinity Church. It\'s also one of the few great mansions left on Prairie Avenue, once home to such heavy hitters as retailer Marshall Field and meat-packing magnate Philip Armour. The area has lately seen the arrival of new, high-end construction, but nothing beats a tour of Glessner House, a remarkable relic of the days when merchant princes really lived like royalty.

It doesn\'t have any permanent exhibits; even the works from its collection are constantly rotating. This gives it a feeling of freshness, but it also makes it impossible to predict what will be on display at any time. Special exhibits are devoted mostly to original shows you can\'t see anywhere else.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Highlights</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The MCA\'s dramatic quarters</b> were designed by Berlin architect Josef Paul Kleihues. From the outside, the building looks like a home for modern art—it\'s made of square metal plates, with round bolts in each corner.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The MCA\'s growing 7,000-piece collection,</b> which includes work by René Magritte, Alexander Calder, Bruce Nauman, Sol LeWitt, Franz Kline, and June Leaf, makes up about half the museum (pieces on view continually rotate). The other half is dedicated to temporary exhibitions.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The museum showcases work in all mediums,</b> including paintings, sculpture, works on paper, photography, video, film, and installations.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Guided \"Exhibition Focus\" tours dedicated to short-run exhibits happen daily; \"Highlights Tours,\" which provide a balanced sweep of the entire museum, are offered on weekends.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The MCA Store is the place to go</b> for well-designed jewelry and quirky items for the home, from a porcelain eggshell from which a flower sprouts to goggles to be worn while chopping onions.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tips</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The back of the MCA is one of the best spots to have lunch in the city. Run by Wolfgang Puck, Puck\'s Café at the MCA has a tasty menu.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Try to catch one of the cutting-edge music and theater performances; one year, for example, the entire front of the museum was turned into a puppet theater.

The Yangtze is one of the richest rivers in the world in terms of sites and currently, the Three Gorges Damn is its signature draw.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\'re planning a tour of this legendary river, you\'ll definitely be spending some time in Chongqing. Some advice—take your time here. There are over 30 million people in Chongqing and the city is ablaze with neon. For those interested in seeing a working river port, visit the Chaotianmen Docks. Historians at heart will relish the U.S. Chiang Kai-shek Criminal Acts Exhibition Hall &amp; SACO Prison.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chongqing is brimming with history, a thriving food scene, teahouses, bookshops, and clubs. The adjacent villages are nestled in rolling hills, so before parachuting in to seize the Yangtze by the horns, allow a few days of proper Chongqing trekking.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Leaving from Chongqing allows for lots of daytime sightseeing through Yichang, Shashi and Qutang, Wu and Xiling Gorges. However, this trip moves fast and can be frustrating for shutterbugs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Make sure that the tour goes to the Shennong section of the dam. Its steep, foliage-laden hills are some of the most majestic in China—as one might expect to find along the world\'s third largest river.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Jewel of Jiuzhaigou</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Jiuzhaigou Natural Preserve\'s cerulean and aqua pools are among the most beautiful in the world. Its raw natural beauty has been compared to Yellowstone National Park. And so have the size of the crowds—throngs of Chinese tourists descend daily on this 800-ki (497-mi) stretch of lush forests, piercing peaks, languid lakes, and clear pools. UNESCO has given it heritage status for its \"Man and Biosphere\" program. Within the park itself, you can also meet tribes of ethnic Tibetans and Qingnan peoples.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you want to truly experience Jiuzhaigou as the Chinese do, sign up with any of the numerous package tours found in Chengdu and Chongqing. A word to the wise: be prepared to be herded along with a flag and a bullhorn. That being said, the folks on Chinese tours are boisterous and full of curious energy. Foreigners who join them are in for a full cultural immersion.

But in Cincinnati things are a bit more complicated than that. Travelers need to be aware of what the city\'s bridges are really called around town before attempting to drive in the Queen City. Commit this list to memory—or keep it close at hand. Your map won\'t help you here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The proper name of the bridge that connects the eastern portion of Cincinnati with Northern Kentucky is the Combs-Hehl Bridge. Among locals, however, it\'s simply the \"275 Bridge,\" because it is part of the I-275 highway system.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Daniel Beard Bridge crosses the Ohio River from Cincinnati to Northern Kentucky and is part of the I-471 system. But local motorists refer to it as the \"Big Mac Bridge,\" because of its yellow arches.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The double-decker Brent Spence Bridge connects Cincinnati and Covington. Both I-75 and I-71 cross over it. Many locals call it the I-75 bridge or the \"Car Strangled Banner.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Two exceptions to this rule are the L&amp;N Bridge and the Taylor Southgate Bridge. The L&amp;N Bridge connects Pete Rose Way in Cincinnati to Northern Kentucky and is so named because the L&amp;N railroad tracks also run on it. The Taylor Southgate Bridge, which connects Newport, Kentucky, to Cincinnati is a fairly new bridge that\'s also called by its proper name—for now. Give Cincinnatians some time to think about it.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Touring the Town</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Scenic Cincinnati begs to be explored. Cover the downtown highlights on foot, then jump in your car for Eden Park and Union Terminal mini-sidetrips.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Park downtown near Fountain Square, at the intersection of 5th and Vine streets. Even better, park underneath Fountain Square; the 24-hour lot charges $1 for the first 2 hours; $15 for the entire day. Take a look at the Tyler Davidson Fountain, and if it\'s near lunchtime, grab a sandwich to munch on a park bench or at an outdoor table. It\'s a fun place to be if it\'s a nice day, and there\'s often an event afoot. From there, cross the street to Carew Tower. You can get a wonderful view of the city from the 48th-floor observation deck. Double back on 5th Street past Fountain Square, and take a left on Walnut to 6th. Follow 6th to the Contemporary Arts Center. You don\'t even have to go in; the building itself is a marvel to look at. Return to 5th Street and go east for about four blocks until you come to Pike Street; turn right and you\'ll soon arrive at the Taft Museum of Art, famous for its Chinese porcelains. Next walk south to East Pete Rose Way and Eggleston Avenue. Here you\'ll find the Bicentennial Commons at Sawyer Point; monuments at this riverfront park tell the story of Cincinnati\'s origins as a river town. Not that you\'re likely to miss it, but be sure to check out the National Steamboat Monument, on Mehring Way next to the Public Landing. The interactive installation has computer-synchronized, infrared proximity sensors embedded in 24 metal smokestacks.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Walk back and retrieve your car; follow 7th Street to Gilbert Avenue; drive north until you see Eden Park, a grand greenspace overlooking downtown. Here you\'ll find the Cincinnati Art Museum, known for its collection of works by Cincinnati\'s own Frank Duveneck, and the Krohn Conservatory, where plants from all over the world are exhibited in natural settings.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After relaxing for a bit in the park, get back in your car and take Gilbert Avenue to Central Parkway, turning right on Elm Street. Continue on Elm until you come to the Music Hall, which was built in 1878 and is the home of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. Back in your car, the next stop is the Museum Center at Union Terminal, west of the Music Hall, off I-75 at Ezzard Charles Drive. This historic former train station houses the Cinergy Children\'s Museum, an imaginative place filled with interactive exhibits; the Museum of Natural History and Science, which has a cave with real bats; the Cincinnati History Museum; and an OMNIMAX Theater.

The passion for Queen Margrethe II is infectious, and before long you may find yourself waving the Dannebrog flag along with the rest of them when the queen passes through. Graceful and gregarious, Queen Margrethe II is the embodiment of the new Danish crown, a monarchy that is steeped in history yet decidedly modern in its outlook.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Denmark\'s royal lineage has its roots in the 10th-century Kingdom of Gorm the Old. His son, Harald Bluetooth, established the royal headquarters in Zealand, where it remains to this day. Copenhagen\'s stately Amalienborg Slot has been the official royal residence since 1784. From here Queen Margrethe reigns in a true Danish style marked by sociability, not stuffiness. Renowned for her informal charm, the Queen has fostered an open, familial relationship between the royal house and the Danish public. Queen Margrethe\'s nurturing role has evolved naturally in a country of Denmark\'s petite size and population. Though she lives in Copenhagen, the Queen is far from Zealand-bound.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Margrethe wasn\'t always destined to be queen. When she was born in 1940, the law of succession was limited to sons, and it wasn\'t until 1953 that the law was ratified to include female accession of the throne. She was groomed to become queen, and on her 18th birthday stepped into her position as heir apparent to the crown. She studied archaeology and political science both at home and abroad, at the Universities of Copenhagen, Århus, Cambridge, and the Sorbonne. In 1967 Margrethe married the French-born Prince Henrik, born a count near Cahors, France.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Today\'s modern monarchy is perhaps best exemplified by what the queen does when she takes off her crown. An accomplished artist and illustrator, she designed the costumes for an acclaimed television production of Hans Christian Andersen\'s <i>The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep.</i> She also illustrated an edition of J. R. R. Tolkien\'s <i>The Lord of the Rings.</i> Her paintings have been exhibited in galleries, where they command top prices, all of which she donates to charity.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If there\'s anyone in the royal circle who has captured the public\'s hearts like Queen Margrethe, it\'s the elegant, stylish, Tasmanian-born Crown Princess Mary, who married Crown Prince Frederik in 2004 at Copenhagen Cathedral. Some 180 million people worldwide watched the event. The couple now has two children; the first-born, Christian, who will one day become king, was born in 2005.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Frederik\'s younger brother also went abroad for love. Prince Joachim married Hong Kong-born Alexandra in 1995, but the couple divorced in 2004. Both have since remarried—Joachim to the French Marie Cavallier, who is fast catching up to Mary in terms of style and popularity. When in Denmark, you will become familiar with the faces of all of these royals, since they always occupy the front pages of the Danish tabloids sold at the front of every convenience store.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Artlessness of Danish Design</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">\"There is one art—no more, no less—to do all things—with artlessness,\" Danish inventor and poet Piet Hein once wrote in the daily paper <i>Politiken.</i> The poem sums up the essence of the Danish design, where less really is more.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">What\'s now commonly recognized as Danish Modern design flourished here during the years of economic depression around WW II. With a firm rooting in tradition—materials used in Denmark for centuries and age-old local craftsmanship—the basic principle of this new ethos was simplicity, followed by the probing question: \"It might look pretty, but is it comfortable?\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Among the most famous products are Poul Henningsen\'s PH lamps; Arne Jacobsen\'s Egg, Swan, and Ant Chairs; and Hans J. Wegner\'s Round Chair. These objects become more interesting when learning stories about their makers, how they dreamed up their creations, and where these objects later turned up. For example, Poul Henningsen invented the world\'s tallest stilts at the age of 14—and an inflatable bicycle! Henningsen also designed a blackout lamp for Tivoli in 1941. The lamp, which couldn\'t be seen from overflying airplanes, allowed the park to stay open until midnight during the war. Arne Jacobsen designed the space-age cutlery used in Stanley Kubrick\'s movie <i>2001: A Space Odyssey.</i> And, for the famous 1961 Nixon-Kennedy debate, the rivals sat in Wegner\'s Round Chairs. So many Americans subsequently ordered the chair that Wegner and his workers could not keep up.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The central tenet of producing an object with the simplest, most efficient means is still being followed and developed by Danish designers today. On a smaller scale, Lego blocks, invented in Denmark, teach children worldwide that great things can be constructed with the most elementary of pieces. Danes are increasingly becoming occupied with designing products for a more sustainable future that reaches beyond the borders of the little country. Vestas, for example, the world\'s leading company for modern windmill technology, today has 33,500 wind turbines in 63 countries.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When in Denmark, it\'s fun to discover design in the context of everyday life. Upon arrival, take a rest after your long journey in one of Poul Kjærholm\'s chairs in <b>Copenhagen Airport</b> \'s Terminal 3. Henningsen\'s spiral lamps are strung throughout <b>Tivoli</b>. Jacobsen has designed a gas station (Kystvejen 24, Charlottenlund), a housing complex (<b>Bellavista,</b> Strandvejen 419-451, Klampenborg), and a theater (<b>Bellevue Teatret,</b> Strandvejen 451, Klampenborg) north of Copenhagen (take Bus 14 from Klampenborg Station). He\'s also the architect of the <b>Nationalbanken</b> (The National Bank), the <b>Radisson SAS Hotel</b> in Copenhagen, and, in Århus, <b>Århus Rådhus.</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For all of the above, you will find that the basic Danish design credo still holds: design is first and foremost intended to be used, not just looked at.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The castle\'s setting is equally welcoming: it\'s in the middle of the Kongens Have (King\'s Garden), amid lawns, park benches, and shady walking paths.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">King Christian IV built Rosenborg Castle as a summer residence but loved it so much that he ended up living and dying here. In 1849, when the absolute monarchy was abolished, all the royal castles became state property, except for Rosenborg, which is still passed down from monarch to monarch. Once a year, during the fall holiday, the castle stays open until midnight, and visitors are invited to explore its darkened interior with bicycle lights. Textual information is also in English.

Tivoli is more sophisticated than a mere amusement park: among its attractions are a pantomime theater, an open-air stage, 38 restaurants (some of them very elegant), and frequent concerts, which cover the spectrum from classical to rock to jazz. Fantastic flower exhibits color the lush gardens and float on the swan-filled ponds.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The park was established in the 1840s, when Danish architect George Carstensen persuaded a worried King Christian VIII to let him build an amusement park on the edge of the city\'s fortifications, rationalizing that \"when people amuse themselves, they forget politics.\" The Tivoli Guard, a youth version of the Queen\'s Royal Guard, performs every day. Try to see Tivoli at least once by night, when 100,000 colored lanterns illuminate the Chinese pagoda and the main fountain. Some evenings there are also fireworks displays. Call to check the season\'s opening and closing dates as well as family discounts. Tivoli is also open select hours around Halloween and from late November until late December. The <b>Nimb</b> (Bernstorffsgade 5, 1577), accessed from inside the gardens as well as from outside year-round, is a complex dating from 1909. It has Moorish-inspired architecture and was, indeed, once a bazaar. It was also one of the first buildings here to house a restaurant—a place for the jet-set crowd in the \'20s and \'30s. A DKr 100-million investment (roughly $20 million) has transformed the building into a multipurpose high-class playground with a luxury all-suite hotel, a bar, a gourmet restaurant, a bistro, a dairy, a chocolate factory, and a well-stocked wine cellar. www.tivoli.dk.

Major development occurred during the 17th and 18th centuries with the expansion of the butter trade, and many attractive Georgian-design buildings with wide bowfront windows were constructed during this time. As late as 1770, Cork\'s present-day main streets—Grand Parade, Patrick Street, and the South Mall—were submerged under the Lee. Around 1800, when the Lee was partially dammed, the river divided into two streams that now flow through the city, leaving the main business and commercial center on an island, not unlike Paris\'s Île de la Cité. As a result, the city features a number of bridges and quays, which, although initially confusing, add greatly to the port\'s unique character.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">\"Rebel Cork\" emerged as a center of the Nationalist Fenian movement in the 19th century. The city suffered great damage during the War of Independence in 1919-21, when much of its center was burned down. Cork is now regaining some of its former glory as a result of sensitive commercial development and an ongoing program of inner-city renewal.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Rare is the day there isn\'t a white behemoth looming on the horizon. Typically, hundreds of day-trippers wander along the waterfront, packing franchise jewelry and souvenir shops and drinking in tourist-trap bars. Precious few explore the beaches and streets favored by locals.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Travelers staying in Cozumel\'s one-of-a-kind hotels experience a totally different island. They quickly learn to stick close to the beach and pool when more than two ships are in port (some days the island gets six). If you\'re lucky enough to stay overnight, consider these strategies for avoiding the crowds.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">1. Time your excursions. Go into San Miguel for early breakfast and errands, then stay out of town for the rest of the day. Wander back after you hear the ships blast their departure warnings (around 5 or 6 PM).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">2. Dive in. Hide from the hordes by slipping underwater. But be sure to choose a small dive operation that travels to less popular reefs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">3. Drive on the wild side. Rent a car and cruise the windward coast, still free of rampant construction. You can picnic and sunbathe on private beaches hidden by limestone outcroppings. Use caution when swimming; the surf can be rough.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">4. Frequent the \"other\" downtown. The majority of Cozumel\'s residents live and shop far from San Miguel\'s waterfront. Avenidas 15, 20, and 25 are packed with taco stands, stationery stores (or <i>papelerías</i>), farmacias, and neighborhood markets. Driving here is a nightmare. Park on a quieter side street and explore the shops and neighborhoods to glimpse a whole different side of Cozumel.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cozumel\'s History</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cozumel\'s name is believed to have come from the Mayan \"Ah-Cuzamil-Peten\" (\"land of the swallows\"). For the Maya, who lived here intermittently between about AD 600 and 1200, the island was not only a center for trade and navigation, but also a sacred place. Pilgrims from all over Mesoamerica came to honor Ixchel, the goddess of fertility, childbirth, the moon, and rainbows. Viewed as the mother of all other gods, Ixchel was often depicted with swallows at her feet. Mayan women, who were expected to visit Ixchel\'s site at least once during their lives, made the dangerous journey from the mainland by canoe. Cozumel\'s main exports were salt and honey; at the time, both were considered more valuable than gold.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1518 Spanish explorer Juan de Grijalva arrived on Cozumel, looking for slaves. His tales of treasure inspired Hernán Cortés, Mexico\'s most famous Spanish explorer, to visit the island the following year. There he met Geronimo de Aguilar and Gonzales Guerrero, Spanish men who had been shipwrecked on Cozumel years earlier. Initially enslaved by the Maya, the two were later accepted into their community. Aguilar joined forces with Cortés, helping set up a military base on the island and using his knowledge of the Maya to defeat them. Guerrero died defending his adopted people; the Maya still consider him a hero. By 1570 most Mayan islanders had been massacred by Spaniards or killed by disease. By 1600 the island was abandoned.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the 17th and 18th centuries, pirates found Cozumel to be the perfect hideout. Two notorious buccaneers, Jean Laffite and Henry Morgan, favored the island\'s safe harbors and hid their treasures in the Mayan catacombs and tunnels. By 1843 Cozumel had again been abandoned. Five years later, 20 families fleeing Mexico\'s brutal War of the Castes resettled the island; their descendants still live on Cozumel.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">By the early 20th century the island began capitalizing on its abundant supply of <i>zapote</i> (sapodilla) trees, which produce chicle, prized by the chewing-gum industry (think Chiclets). Shipping routes began to include Cozumel, whose deep harbors made it a perfect stop for large vessels. Jungle forays in search of chicle led to the discovery of ruins; soon archaeologists began visiting the island as well. Meanwhile, Cozumel\'s importance as a seaport diminished as air travel grew, and demand for chicle dropped off with the invention of synthetic chewing gum.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For decades Cozumel was another backwater where locals fished, hunted alligators and iguanas, and worked on coconut plantations to produce <i>copra,</i> the dried kernels from which coconut oil is extracted. Cozumeleños subsisted largely on seafood, still a staple of the local economy. During World War II the U.S. Army built an airstrip and maintained a submarine base here, accidentally destroying some Mayan ruins. Then in the 1960s the underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau helped make Cozumel a vacation spot by featuring its incredible reefs on his television show. Today Cozumel is among the world\'s most popular diving locations.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The most popular street foods are <i>papri chaat</i> (fried wafers piled high with potatoes, chick peas, yogurt, and chilli powder), <i>chole bhatura</i> (also known as chana bhatura—spicy chick peas with fried, airy <i>puri</i> bread), and <i>golgappas</i> (fried dough in a hollow golf-ball shape, which you fill with a spicy mixture of potatoes, chick peas, tamarind, and coriander sauce), <i>pakoras</i> (battered and fried vegetables, cheese, or chicken), and the Bombay delicacy known as <i>bhel puri</i> (spicy rice with bits of onion). The best places to nosh on these snacks are in neighborhood markets.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Near Connaught Place, the <b>Bengali Sweet House</b> (27-37 Bengali Market, Connaught Place) is a classic spot for evening <i>golgappa</i> outings. <b>Evergreen Sweet House</b> (S-30 Green Park Market) has a charming tin ceiling under which a large crowd stuffs itself with <i>chole bhatura</i> and vegetarian thalis (combination platters). <b>Nathu\'s</b> (2 Sundar Nagar Market) is the perfect place to kick back after shopping for high-end souvenirs, with its robust Indian sweets and pleasant seating area. The nearby Sweets Corner supplies the fried stuff outdoors. <b>Prince Paan Box</b> (M-Block Market, eastern corner, Greater Kailash I) has one of Delhi\'s most popular chaat-wallahs (snack vendors), with a crowd at all hours. They\'re also known, of course, for their <i>paan</i> (betel nut leaves that include various ingredients). There\'s no seating. At the <b>Bikanerwala</b> (Hauz Khas Village) you can sample Gujarati snacks—ask for <i>khandvi</i> (a delicious pan-fried snack made from a seasoned batter of chick-pea flour and buttermilk, then cut into rolls and sprinkled with coconut and coriander) or <i>dhokla</i> (a savory, fluffy, steamed cake made with chick-pea flour, mustard seeds, and a pinch of sugar and topped with coriander leaves).</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dressing the Part</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many traveling women (and a few traveling men) are inspired to buy an Indian outfit to wear for the duration of their trip. Here\'s a primer:</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The traditional North Indian women\'s ensemble of a long tunic over loose pants is known as a salwar-kameez. Today, it is equally common in a variation called the kurta-churidar. The word <i>kameez</i> is a general term meaning \"shirt,\" whereas <i>kurta</i> specifies a traditional Indian tunic worn by both women and men. The pants worn beneath women\'s kurtas take two forms: the <i>salwar,</i> which is very loose, with only a slight gather at the ankle, and the <i>churidar,</i> which is loose in the thigh but tight along the calf, bunched up near the ankle like leggings. Presently the churidar is in greater vogue than the salwar, and true fashionistas now wear very short (above the knee) kurtas over thigh-tight churidars, a look with a Western element: it favors skinny women. Most women opt for knee- or calf-length kurtas.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The outfit is usually finished with a matching <i>dupatta</i> or <i>chunni,</i> a long scarf draped over the chest with the ends dangling in back, traditionally two meters long and one meter wide. These days you\'re free to drape the dupatta however you like; slinging it back from the neck, or even forward from the neck (Western-style), gives the outfit a modern twist. Just beware of dupattas made of stiff or starchy fabric—no matter how beautiful they look, you will probably find them unwieldy. A dupatta is particularly useful in places like Old Delhi and Nizamuddin, where you can pull it over your head as a kerchief if you feel too conspicuous.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You won\'t have to invest much in any of these items; at Fabindia or Dilli Haat you can buy a smart trio of kurta, churidar or salwar, and dupatta for US$25. Another option at Dilli Haat and some fabric stores is to buy uncut \"suit fabric,\" a smartly matched set of three pieces of fabric meant to be sewn into the full regalia. If you buy suit fabric, simply take it all to a tailor (ask any market merchant to suggest one; most are holes-in-the-wall), allow him to measure you, tell him what kind of neckline you fancy and whether you want a churidar or salwar, and come back for your custom-made \"suit.\" This can take a few days, but the tailoring costs about US$10 and these ensembles are very attractive.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Men\'s kurtas are traditionally paired with a churidar or with loose, straight-legged \"pyjamas.\" Most urban Indian men wear Western shirts and trousers, but Delhi\'s politicians keep the white cotton kurta-pyjama and the more formal <i>dhoti</i> (a loose, bunchy men\'s skirt) alive and kicking. Formal silk kurta-churidars are trotted out only for weddings.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many Western women who buy salwar-kameez choose muted colors, perhaps on the premise that light skin tones need light fabric tones. Unfortunately, muted colors often make Westerners look washed-out and even more \"foreign.\" Be bold! Women of all complexions are flattered by the jewel tones of many Indian clothes.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

An architectural marvel built over five years and without using steel, the elaborate main temple and its soaring domes and 20,000 carved figures only appear ancient.

Gandhi was shot and killed by a Hindu fanatic on January 30, 1948, his body was cremated on the banks of the Yamuna River. His <i>samadhi,</i> or cremation site, is now a national shrine, where Indian tourists and pilgrims stream across the peaceful lawn to pay their respects to the saintlike Father of the Nation. At the center of a large courtyard is a raised slab of black marble adorned with flowers and inscribed with Gandhi\'s final words, Hai Ram! (Oh, God!). An eternal flame burns at its head. The sandstone walls enclosing the shrine are inscribed with passages written by Gandhi, translated into several tongues including Tamil, Malayalam, Nepali, Urdu, Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese. Near Raj Ghat are the cremation sites of two other assassinated heads of state, Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv (no relation to Mohandas). Back across the boulevard is the <b>National Gandhi Museum,</b> run by a private foundation, which houses a great many photographs, a display of spinning wheels with some information on Gandhi\'s <i>khadi</i> (homespun cotton) crusade, and some of the Mahatma\'s personal effects, including the blood-stained dhoti he was wearing at the time of his murder. The tiny art gallery has a poignant wooden sculpture, made by a South African, of Gandhi in a pose suggesting Jesus\'s Crucifixion. A film on Gandhi\'s life is shown on weekends at 4. COST: Free.

Completed in 1656 after six years of work by 5,000 laborers, it\'s arguably one of the loveliest houses of worship in the world. Three sets of broad steps lead to two-story gateways and a magnificent courtyard with a square ablution tank in the center. The entire space is enclosed by pillared corridors, with domed pavilions in each corner. Thousands gather to pray here, especially on Friday.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With its onion-shaped dome and tapering minarets, the mosque is characteristically Moghul, but Shah Jahan added an innovation: the stripes running smartly up and down the marble domes and minarets. The whole structure exudes peace and harmony—climb the south minaret to see the domes up close, complete with swarms of pigeons, and to see how finely the mosque contrasts with the commercial streets around it. (Women cannot enter the minaret without a man; if you\'re a woman traveling solo, enlist a man to help you, as the beauty of the architecture is best appreciated from above.) Look into the prayer hall (you can only enter after a ritual purification at the ablution tank) for the pulpit carved from a single slab of marble. In one corner is a room where Shah Jahan installed the marble footprints of the Prophet Mohammed. COST: Free, Rs. 10 to climb minaret, Rs. 100 for permission to use camera or camcorder.

Visitors are treated to Asian, pre-Columbian, and Spanish Colonial works along with a world-famous collection of Native American pieces.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Red Rocks Amphitheatre:</b> Even if you aren\'t attending a concert, the awe-inspiring red rocks of this formation-turned-venue are worth a look. There are hiking trails nearby, and the visitor center displays photographs and memorabilia from concerts past.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Denver Botanic Gardens:</b> Brilliant and creatively arranged displays of more than 15,000 plant species from around the world draw garden enthusiasts throughout summer, and in the off-season the tropical conservatory is a warm, welcoming haven. Tea ceremonies and world-renowned musicians add an extra spark.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Larimer Square:</b> Specialty stores, superior people-watching, and some of the city\'s top restaurants bring tourists and locals alike to one of Denver\'s liveliest sections. Located on the city\'s oldest street, it is also home to red brick-lined Writer Square, a charming courtyard area of boutique stores and coffee shops.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>LoDo:</b> Lower downtown\'s appeal lies in its proximity to Coors Field, its navigational ease thanks to the free Mall shuttle, and its plethora of great restaurants, nightclubs, and art galleries. A busy area for shopping and spa-hopping by day, it is the hot spot of choice for the city\'s hipsters by night.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Denver\'s Music Scene</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Colorado\'s moments of pop-music history have been spectacular. Many happened at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, where the Beatles performed in 1964 and U2\'s Bono made his famous \"this song is not a rebel song—this song is \'Sunday Bloody Sunday\'\" speech in 1983. The Denver-Boulder area was a huge hub for country-rock in the \'70s, and members of the Eagles, Poco, Firefall, and others lived here, at least briefly.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Some of the most famous spots have closed, but rock fans can tour the hallowed ground—Ebbets Field, where Steve Martin and Lynyrd Skynyrd made early-career appearances in the \'70s, at 15th and Curtis; and the original Auditorium Theatre, where Led Zeppelin performed its first U.S. show in 1968, at 14th and Curtis. The local scene remains strong, with the Samples, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Leftover Salmon, String Cheese Incident, Apples In Stereo, and Dressy Bessy attracting audiences. Check <i>Westword</i> for show listings.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Green Chile</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Not the pepper itself but a gravylike stew is what Coloradans refer to when they talk about <i>chile verde,</i> the heady mixture that migrated with families who made their way from Mexico up through New Mexico and Texas and over from California to settle the high country. Its recipes vary as much across the state as minestrone does across Italy and pot-au-feu across France, but you can usually count on a pork-based concoction with jalapenos, sometimes tomatoes, and maybe tomatillos, with the heat ranging from mellow to sinus-clearing.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Arguments rage over the best Mexican joints for a proper bowl, but most agree that Federal Boulevard in Denver is the place for the most <i>auténtico.</i> Green chile can smother just about anything—from enchiladas to huevos—but a plain bowlful with a warmed tortilla is all the purist requires, and it\'s the best hangover cure ever.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It houses a rich combination of traditional collections—dinosaur remains, animal dioramas, a mineralogy display, an Egyptology wing—and intriguing hands-on exhibits. In the Hall of Life, you can test your health and fitness on a variety of contraptions and receive a personalized health profile. The Prehistoric Journey exhibit covers the seven stages of Earth\'s development. The massive complex also includes an IMAX movie theater and a planetarium whose Space Odyssey exhibit simulates a trip to Mars and thoroughly annotates the stars in the night sky. The impressively refurbished eating-and-relaxation area has a full-window panoramic view of the Rocky Mountains. www.dmns.org. COST: Museum $11, IMAX $8; $16 for combined pass. OPEN: Daily, showtimes vary. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Denver Art Museum</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Unique displays of Asian, pre-Columbian, Spanish Colonial, and Native American art are the hallmarks of this model of museum design. Among the museum\'s regular holdings are John DeAndrea\'s sexy, soothing, life-size polyvinyl painting <i>Linda</i> (1983); Claude Monet\'s dreamy flowerscape <i>Le Bassin des Nympheas</i> (1904); and Charles Deas\' red-cowboy-on-horseback <i>Long Jakes, The Rocky Mountain Man</i> (1844). The works are thoughtfully lighted, though dazzling mountain views through hallway windows sometimes steal your attention. Imaginative hands-on exhibits and video corners will appeal to children; the Adventures in Art Center has hands-on art classes and exploration for children and adults. With the opening of the $90.5 million Frederic C. Hamilton building in October 2007, the museum doubled in size. Designed by architect Daniel Libeskind, the 146,000-square-foot addition prompts debate: Some to say the glass and titanium design has ruined the view, while others think the building is a work of art in its own right. To the east of the museum is an outdoor plaza—you\'ll know it by the huge, orange metal sculpture—that leads to the Denver Public Library next door. www.denverartmuseum.org.

On one hand, he may have contributed more than any other individual besides his friend and mentor Thomas Edison to the reality of the modern world. On the other hand, he fought to suppress and control a society that would remain forever at arm\'s length. He could be talkative and entertaining, but could suddenly stop in mid-sentence and blurt out, \"That\'s not what I was thinking at all,\" excusing himself to disappear into his laboratory, sometimes for days, until he emerged with a new engine element, new car design, factory layout, rail locomotive, or other pioneering idea.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Born on July 30, 1863, in Dearborn, he was the oldest of six children born to first-generation Irish farmers William and Mary Litogot O\'Hern Ford. Not rich but far from poor, the family fared well. Ford\'s legendary curiosity was demonstrated at an early age. Fascinated by the vapors rising from the boiling water in the tea kettle on the kitchen stove, Henry plugged up the spout. With no outlet for the steam, the kettle exploded, shooting hot water in all directions. His practical side began as he tinkered with farm tools. He was fond of recounting the July day in 1876 when he saw his first self-propelled steam engine working a farmer\'s field.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fifty years later, Ford was producing 57percent of the automobiles sold in America and around half the cars sold worldwide. As an adult, Ford allowed no one to use his first name, but he was proud to affix his last name on the affordable Model T and Model A automobiles. The slender five-foot, nine-inch, long-legged industrialist baffled even those who knew him best. When he set the industrial world on edge with his production line for the Model T and $5 for an eight-hour workday, he built nearby housing complexes where workers lived to keep his factories moving. Workers grumbled at Ford rules that came with living there. Inspectors knocked at regular intervals, inquiring into lifestyles with questions that some took as intrusive. As in other matters, it was Ford\'s way or no way.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1915, as World War I dragged on, Ford\'s pacifist leanings led him to lease the sailing ship Oscar II which he proclaimed the Peace Ship. On December 4, he boarded her and set sail for Norway on a self-proclaimed mission to end the war, pledging to be \"home by Christmas.\" The effort failed, but Ford later said, \"At least I tried.\" Years later, with the advent of World War II, his pacifism took a back seat to full-out, one-an-hour factory production of B-24 \"Liberator\" bombers at Willow Run.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1916, the Chicago Tribune attributed to Ford the incorrect information that employees who left their jobs to serve in the National Guard would lose their jobs. The following day a Tribune editorial followed up by calling Ford an \"ignorant idealist.\" Ford sued, and the trial—staged in Mount Clemens—made headlines around the world. Well aware of Ford\'s lack of interest beyond the inventive, experts drilled him for hours about his general knowledge of the day. He saw little value in the drills, since he said he could pay workers to locate such information for him in five minutes. Badgered by lawyers, with journalists frantically taking notes, Ford calmly sat in the witness chair, his long legs crossed as he sharpened his pocket knife absently on the bottom of his leather shoe. When asked what this nation was before its discovery by the Europeans, he kept sharpening his knife and without a glance upward, said, \"Dirt, I guess.\" The jury settled against the Tribune, but awarded Ford only six cents in damages.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The common people loved his folksy responses—and bought more Fords. After the trial, Ford seemed more conscious of education and history. He built schools, experimental farms, small-town factories, and hospitals. He developed an obsessive collection of historical memorabilia, and housed it in the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village at Dearborn. An avid camper, Ford took long auto trips—in Model Ts, with a Japanese chef—with Thomas Edison, Harvey Firestone, and naturalist John Burroughs. An avid hiker, he would be out morning and afternoon, ending the day around a campfire telling rambling stories and tall tales.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Exasperated with the newspapers of the day, he published his own Dearborn Independent where he aired his own anti-Semitic and anti-labor views. In 1933, Ford led the fight against the fledgling United Auto Workers (uaw\") unionization efforts led by Walter Reuther. Hiring an army (some claim it numbered up to 2,000) ironically called the \"Service Department,\" Ford took on the union organizers. In 1937, the conflict erupted in the \"Battle of the Overpass,\" where Ford\'s goons viciously attacked Reuther and other uaw\" officials handing out union flyers near a Ford plant gate. Photojournalists captured the incident, and it outraged the nation. Courts ordered Ford to cease interfering with union activities, and the uaw\" contract was signed in 1941.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ford was notorious for avoiding his office, preferring instead the noise and clatter of his assembly line. To escape the social whirl of Detroit, he built his Fair Lane estate at Dearborn. Then, prompted by his love of dancing, he organized grand balls that were the rage of society. In 1945, Ford\'s grandson Henry II took him to Greenfield Village, and watched his 81-year-old grandfather climb aboard his original \"quadricycle\" horseless carriage for a ride along the streets of the man-made colonial America. In 1947, the man who idolized Thomas Edison and his electric lightbulb, the man who did the most to create the world on wheels, died quietly by candlelight.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The same Cistercian criteria applied to Fontenay as to Pontigny: no-frills architecture and an isolated site—the spot was especially remote, for it had been decreed that these monasteries could not be established anywhere near \"cities, feudal manors, or villages.\" The monks were required to live a completely self-sufficient existence, with no contact whatsoever with the outside world. By the end of the 12th century the buildings were finished, and the abbey\'s community grew to some 300 monks. Under the protection of Pope Gregory IX and Hughes IV, duke of Burgundy, the monastery soon controlled huge land holdings, vineyards, and timberlands. It prospered until the 16th century, when religious wars and administrative mayhem hastened its decline. Dissolved during the French Revolution, the abbey was used as a paper factory until 1906. Fortunately, the historic buildings emerged unscathed. The abbey is surrounded by extensive, immaculately tended gardens dotted with the fountains that gave it its name. The church\'s solemn interior is lightened by windows in the façade and by a double row of three narrow windows, representing the Trinity, in the choir. A staircase in the south transept leads to the wooden-roof dormitory (spare a thought for the bleary-eyed monks, obliged to stagger down for services in the dead of night). The chapter house, flanked by a majestic arcade, and the scriptorium, where monks worked on their manuscripts, leads off from the adjoining cloisters. www.abbayedefontenay.com. COST: EUR 8.90.

The palace now houses one of France\'s major art museums, the <b>Musée des Beaux-Arts</b> (Fine Arts Museum). Here are displayed the magnificent tombs sculpted by celebrated artist Claus Sluter for dukes Philip the Bold and his son John the Fearless—note their dramatically moving mourners, hidden in shrouds. These are just two of the highlights of a rich collection of medieval objects and Renaissance furniture gathered here as testimony to Marguerite of Flanders, wife of Philip the Bold, who brought to Burgundy not only her dowry, the rich province of Flanders (modern-day Belgium), but also a host of distinguished artists—including Rogier van der Weyden, Jan van Eyck, and Claus Sluter. Their artistic legacy can be seen in this collection, as well as at several of Burgundy\'s other museums and monuments. Among the paintings are works by Italian old masters and French 19th-century artists, such as Théodore Géricault and Gustave Courbet, and their Impressionist successors, notably Édouard Manet and Claude Monet.

Spectacularly adorned with rusticated obelisks, pagoda-like towers, the finest in French Classicist ornament, and a \"grand canal,\" the château is centered around a typical <i>cour d\'honneur.</i> Inside, the Hall of Caesars vestibule, framed by wrought-iron railings, leads to a wood-panel salon and dining room filled with period furniture. A graceful staircase climbs to the second floor, which has the showstopper—a gigantic gallery frescoed in Italianate trompe l\'oeil. A small room in the tower above was used as a secret meeting place by Huguenot Protestants during the 1562-98 Wars of Religion; note the cupola with its fresco of scantily clad 16th-century religious personalities. www.chateaux-france.com/tanlay.

Cluny\'s medieval abbots were as powerful as popes; in 1098 Pope Urban II (himself a Cluniac) assured the head of his old abbey that Cluny was the \"light of the world.\" That assertion, of dubious religious validity, has not stood the test of time—after the Revolution the abbey was sold as national property and much of it used as a stone quarry. Today Cluny stands in ruins, a reminder of the vanity of human grandeur. The ruins, however, suggest the size and gorgeous super-romantic glory of the abbey at its zenith, and piecing it back together in your mind is part of the attraction.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In order to get a clear sense of what you\'re looking at, start at the <b>Porte d\'Honneur,</b> the entrance to the abbey from the village, whose classical architecture is reflected in the pilasters and Corinthian columns of the <b>Clocher de l\'Eau-Bénite</b> (a majestic bell tower), crowning the only remaining part of the abbey church, the south transept. Between the two is the reconstructed monumental staircase, which led to the portal of the abbey church, and the excavated column bases of the vast narthex. The entire nave is gone. On one side of the transept is a national horse-breeding center (<i>haras</i>) founded in 1806 by Napoléon and constructed with materials from the destroyed abbey; on the other is an elegant pavilion built as new monks\' lodgings in the 18th century. The gardens in front of it once contained an ancient lime tree (destroyed by a 1982 storm) named after Abélard, the controversial philosopher who sought shelter at the abbey in 1142. Off to the right is the 13th-century <i>farinier</i> (flour mill), with its fine oak-and-chestnut roof and collection of exquisite Romanesque capitals from the vanished choir. The <b>Musée Ochier,</b> in the abbatial palace, contains Europe\'s foremost Romanesque lapidary museum. Vestiges of both the abbey and the village constructed around it are conserved here, as well as part of the Bibliothèque des Moines (Monks\' Library). www.cluny.monuments-nationaux.fr. COST: EUR 7.

Here Niccolò dell\'Abate and other court artists created rooms filled with murals depicting the signs of the zodiac, the Battle of Pharsala, and the motif of Diana in Her Bath (much favored by Diane de Poitiers, sister of the Comtesse de Tonnerre). Such grandeur won the approval of the Sun King, Louis XIV, no less, who once stayed in the Salon Bleu (Blue Room). www.chateau-ancy.com. COST: EUR 9. OPEN: Apr.-Sept., tours Tues.-Sun. at 10:30, 11:30, 2, 3, 4, and 5; Oct.-mid-Nov., tours Tues.-Sun. at 10:30, 11:30, 2, 3, and 4. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cathédrale St-Étienne</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cathédrale St-Étienne was once the French sanctuary for Thomas à Becket and a model for England\'s Canterbury Cathedral. You can see the cathedral\'s 240-foot south tower from way off; the highway forges straight past it. The pompous 19th-century buildings lining the narrow main street—notably the meringuelike Hôtel de Ville—can give you a false impression if you\'re in a hurry: the streets leading off it near the cathedral (notably Rue Abelard and Rue Jean-Cousin) are full of half-timber medieval houses. On Monday the cathedral square is crowded with merchants\' stalls, and the beautiful late-19th-century market hall—a distant cousin of Baltard\'s former iron-and-glass Halles in Paris—throbs with people buying meat and produce. A smaller market is held on Friday morning.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Begun around 1140, the cathedral once had two towers; one was topped in 1532 by an elegant though somewhat incongruous Renaissance campanile that contains two monster bells; the other collapsed in the 19th century. Note the trefoil arches decorating the exterior of the remaining tower. The gallery, with statues of former archbishops of Sens, is a 19th-century addition, but the statue of St. Stephen, between the doors of the central portal, is thought to date from late in the 12th century. The vast, harmonious interior is justly renowned for its stained-glass windows; the oldest (circa 1200) are in the north transept and include the stories of the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son; those in the south transept were manufactured in 1500 in Troyes and include a much-admired <i>Tree of Jesse.</i> Stained-glass windows in the north of the chancel retrace the story of Thomas à Becket: Becket fled to Sens from England to escape the wrath of Henry II before returning to his cathedral in Canterbury, where he was murdered in 1170. Below the window (which shows him embarking on his journey in a boat, and also at the moment of his death) is a medieval statue of an archbishop said to have come from the site of Becket\'s home in Sens. Years of restoration work have permitted the display of Becket\'s <i>aube</i> (vestment) in the annex to the Palais Synodal. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Basilique Ste-Madeleine</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the 11th and 12th centuries the celebrated Basilique Ste-Madeleine was one of the focal points of Christendom. Pilgrims poured in to see the relics of St. Mary Magdalene (in the crypt) before setting off on the great trek to the shrine of St. James at Santiago de Compostela, in northwest Spain. Several pivotal church declarations of the Middle Ages were made from here, including St. Bernard\'s preaching of the Second Crusade (which attracted a huge French following) and Thomas à Becket\'s excommunication of English king Henry II. By the mid-13th century the authenticity of St. Mary\'s relics was in doubt; others had been discovered in Provence. The basilica\'s decline continued until the French Revolution, when the basilica and adjoining monastery buildings were sold by the state. Only the basilica, cloister, and dormitory escaped demolition, and were falling into ruin when ace restorer Viollet-le-Duc, sent by his mentor Prosper Merimée, rode to the rescue in 1840 (he also restored the cathedrals of Laon and Amiens and Paris\'s Notre-Dame).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Today the UNESCO-listed basilica has recaptured much of its glory and is considered to be one of France\'s most prestigious Romanesque showcases. The exterior tympanum was redone by Viollet-le-Duc (have a look at the eroded original as you exit the cloister), but the narthex (circa 1150) is a Romanesque masterpiece. Note the interwoven zodiac signs and depictions of seasonal crafts along its rim, similar to those at both Troyes and Autun. The pilgrims\' route around the building is indicated by the majestic flowers, which metamorphose into full-blown blooms, over the left-hand entrance on the right; an annual procession is still held on July 22. The basilica\'s exterior is best seen from the leafy terrace to the right of the façade. Opposite, a vast, verdant panorama encompasses vines, lush valleys, and rolling hills. In the foreground is the Flamboyant Gothic spire of St-Père-sous-Vézelay, a tiny village 3 km (2 mi) away that is the site of Marc Meneau\'s famed restaurant. www.vezelaytourisme.com.

The leading male members of the ruling family are called sheikhs, which loosely translates to \"prince,\" and leadership is passed down through the family but is not an automatic right of the eldest son. Rather, the current sheikh chooses who will succeed him from eligible members of the family.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Dubai is one of seven countries that make up the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a federation founded in 1971. The other six emirates are: Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm al-Quwain. The UAE\'s main legislative body (the Federal Supreme Council, or FSC), is made up of the seven sheikhs of each emirate, but Abu Dhabi is the preeminent emirate in the federation. The president of the UAE plays an influential role and is always the sheikh of Abu Dhabi, a hereditary post that\'s passed down to a member of the Al-Nahyan family—currently Sheikh Kahlifa bin Zayed Al-Nahyan. The sheikh of Dubai is vice president.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Each emirate controls most of its own domestic matters, including taxes, trade, and investment, but the federation oversees foreign policy and defense. The UAE cultivates friendly relations with other Arab states, as a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), as well as with the United States and other Western nations.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Federal National Council, which has 40 members including eight from Dubai, acts as a consulting body. Until 2006 sheikhs appointed the council members, but the nation is trending toward mass representation and now a group of Emirati, the Electoral College, elects 50% of the chamber. In Dubai, the Dubai Governing Council acts as an advisory body to the sheikh. However, council membership is limited to a small number of Emirati who make up less than 20% of the population. So more than a million people who live and work in Dubai have no political voice.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sheikh Mo</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, known affectionately as \"Sheikh Mo,\" envisioned only the most prosperous future for Dubai. In fact, it was his dream that brought about Burj Dubai, the Palm islands, the tallest tower in the world, and Dubai Marina. But he didn\'t stop there—nothing seems to faze this man, who officially became Dubai\'s ruler in 2006.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Born in 1949, Sheikh Mo was the third son of Sheikh Rashid and grew up on the bank of the Bur Dubai. He excelled at the Al-Ahmadiya School and was allowed at an early age to attend the <i>majlis,</i> or meetings, where his grandfather Sheikh Saeed dealt with matters of state. When his father, Rashid, became sheikh in 1958, he and his brothers began to take on responsibility within the emirate. Mohammed finished his education at a language school in Britain, after which he enrolled in a six-month officer training program at Aldershot in 1968.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When Mohammed returned to Dubai in 1968, he took control of the emirate\'s police force. At this time, Britain announced its withdrawal from the region. His father, along with Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, was instrumental in the creation of the United Arab Emirates in 1971, and Mohammed was appointed minister of defense of the new country.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sheikh Rashid expanded Dubai\'s horizons as a trading and transport hub for the greater Gulf region. He began offering more challenging roles to his son, who at that time oversaw infrastructure improvements, including the expansion of Dubai International Airport, and the management of Dubai\'s oil supplies. In 1981, Sheikh Rashid fell ill, so Mohammed and his brothers collectively assumed control and soon became known for their open-minded approach to government. Sheikh Rashid died in 1990 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sheikh Maktoum, under whose guidance Mohammed broadened his portfolio and grew his reputation as an approachable leader willing to take risks. In 1995 Sheikh Maktoum declared Mohammed Crown Prince of Dubai, paving his way to the sheikhdom.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Throughout his adult life Mohammed\'s favorite pastime has been horse racing. He and his brothers own the successful Godolphin stables and have invested billions of dirham in fine horses that have been trained at state-of-the-art facilities in Newmarket, UK, and Dubai. The Dubai World Cup, the highest purse in the sport, is both a source of pride and passion for Mohammed.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dubai\'s Engineering Miracles</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The rush of groundbreaking developments in Dubai makes it easy to forget it started less than 15 years ago. Dubai began its first foray into engineering history when Sheikh Mohammed announced plans for the Burj Al-Arab hotel in the late 1990s, and today this dramatic hotel takes its place alongside structures such as the Hoover Dam as icons of the modern age.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The sheikh wanted the design of the Burj to symbolize the traditions of his lands, and architect Tom Wright was inspired by the shape of a dhow sail when it catches the wind. For the concept to work Wright had to make the hotel look as if it was floating on water, so it was decided the structure would sit on a little artificial island built about 900 feet off the Jumeirah shore. This island posed interesting problems for Atkins Architects, the firm contracted to build the hotel. To secure the offshore location, Atkins had to construct a firm foundation for the hotel by driving 230 concrete piles 40 meters into the substrate. Atop these piles, a surface layer of concrete blocks was added and held in place by a collar of concrete. This breakthrough feat took three years to complete.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The hotel itself is a masterpiece of modern architecture, with two long steel columns visually anchoring the building and acting as the \"mast\" to its \"sail.\" Steel struts that measure 278-feet long form the structure\'s skeleton, some of which were lifted 656 feet into the air to be correctly positioned. Over 160,000 square feet of Teflon-coated Dyneon flouropolymer material—a revolutionary membrane that offers high UV resistance and allows 90% of light to pass through—is the sail. It softens the lighting streaming into the hotel\'s monumental 590-foot interior atrium. Because the floating restaurant sits off from the building\'s center, it posed a design and construction challenge. But the tiny circular helipad at the summit of the hotel, 725 feet above water, is a simple structure supported by a metal cantilever. While this landmark construction was underway, Sheikh Mohammed also launched the <b>Palm Jumeirah</b> project, an artificial island concept so massive in scale that it can be seen from space. It was soon nicknamed the \"Eighth Wonder of the World.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">True to its name, the Palm Jumeirah was designed in the shape of a palm tree. A 2-mi-long core development of hotels, apartments, and shopping and entertainment complexes in the shape of a trunk will link the palm to the Dubai mainland. At the end of this trunk, a 6.8-mi, 656-foot-wide protective breakwater will surround the palm canopy, which will be made of 17 1.2-mi-long, 820-foot wide \"fronds\" where exclusive private villas will be built. This project—the most audacious land reclamation project in history—was slated to be built offshore from Jumeirah Beach.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">More than 50 engineering and environmental studies were conducted before work commenced to assess everything from traffic flow to water quality. The main challenge was creating a landmass stable enough to support high-rise development. The basic technique involved dredging sand to form the basic shape, driving deep foundations into the sandbanks, covering that core with monumental rocks to anchor the base, and then spraying sand on top of the rocks—a technique called rainbowing—to the final level on which developers could build.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The height of the breakwater canopy was critical as it needed to sit 14.7 feet above normal sea level to account for rising water levels during regular <i>shamal,</i> or storm systems, and a once-in-100-year mega-storm scenario. Therefore, the seabed had to be raised nearly 50 feet in some areas. To complete the work, almost 175 million cubic feet of rock had to be strategically placed in the sea to create the curved shapes. This rock was then rainbowed with a staggering amount of sand to soften the landmass.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Despite the vast size of the project and the revolutionary techniques employed, the basic ground works were complete and Palm Jumeirah was ready for development in only two years. There were 20,000 workers on the project at the peak of the infrastructure development.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the last few years, Nakheel broke ground on two far larger palm projects. Palm Jumeirah\'s interior diameter is just over 3 mi, while Palm Jebel Ali\'s interior diameter is 4.6 mi and <b>Palm Deira</b> is a pear-shaped 7.5 mi by 5 mi. However, each project will be built using the same principles as Palm Jumeirah—now an industry standard for all such development.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">But even then, Nakheel didn\'t rest on its laurels; the company\'s next megaproject, <b>The World,</b> posed different problems again for the structural engineers. An archipelago of 300 man-made islands (the smallest around 150,000 square feet) in the shape of the continents, with a 16.7-mile breakwater forming the outline of the planet, The World was the first development to have no land link to the Dubai mainland. Everything from fuel to food and water for the construction workers had to be transported on giant barges from the mainland 2.5 mi to the east. Rock and rainbowing were again used to create the 10-foot base island height. Around 3,884,650,000 cubic feet of sand were needed. Logistical problems included freshwater supply and sewage removal, but these have been solved by allocating an island within each cluster of islands as a distribution and service point for utilities.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The World concept was unveiled in 2003 by Sheikh Mohammed, and the substrate was ready by early 2008. This is the ultimate in real estate. Every tropical island is equipped with state-of-the-art utilities and communication systems, and can be \"terraformed,\" or shaped and landscaped, to fit each client\'s needs. Nakheel won\'t tell who has purchased the islands, but those who have can get to work building their private villas, pools, and gardens. Several exclusive resort developments have been approved and these will surely become must-see hotels in the next five years. There\'s a vast amount of work yet to be done on The World, and even more work to be done before Dubai breaks from its construction frenzy.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

During the 20th century the fort fell into disrepair, but the coral stone and stucco walls were restored, and today it hosts Dubai\'s national museum. Upon entering the museum, you step back in time to before the discovery of oil and the arrival of container ships. A series of cleverly designed subterranean spaces take you through the daily life of Dubai\'s past. For instance, you can stroll through a life-size re-creation of the creekside wharfs and souks, where lifelike figures include fishermen, pearl traders, spice merchants, and metal workers. The sights and sounds of different trades come to life in original sound tracks that play in the background, and with the help of projected images, life-size figures appear as though they\'re performing tasks. Here, you can feel the excitement and energy of what was once one of the Arab world\'s most exciting port towns.

This safe inlet, one of a few in the Gulf area, was the obvious choice for a commercial port for the sea-trade that funds the region. Dubai port developed into the natural focus for ocean traffic around the Gulf, to the west, and for boats from India and Africa. The waterfront bears little resemblance to its early years, because it\'s been dredged and widened several times during the 20th century. On the Deira bank near the creek mouth are a series of low-rise merchant districts that include the major souks. Further inland at Al-Rigga and Garhoud, the Deira creek front is home to the first modernist architecture that transformed the city from local hub into worldwide style icon. Dubai\'s abra, or water taxis, have been transporting people across the creek for as long as anyone can remember. Once powered by oars, tiny engines now push the 20-person wooden craft on the seven- or eight-minute crossing. Abras carried more than 27 million passengers in 2007. COST: Abra fare AED 1.

Their peaks have always been a natural boundary with what is now Oman to the east. The border between Oman and Dubai threads an invisible line around their peaks. The Hajar Mountains are not very high, around 6,000 feet at most, but the stark treeless ridges and golden, red, and ebony hues of the igneous rock present dramatic vistas. The many wadis and dry valleys within the Hajar range are a natural playground for adventure excursions from Dubai. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Burj Dubai</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The world\'s newest tallest building dominates the Dubai skyline like a scimitar pointing skyward. Emaar Properties has vowed to keep the final height of its latest development a secret, but the structure had reached an astonishing 2064 feet, or 629 meters, by April 2008. Designed by Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Burj Dubai will house a mixture of commercial and residential spaces, as well as the first Armani Hotel, which will occupy the first 37 floors of the building. The building (not open to the public at this writing) will be the focus of the new 500-acre Downtown Burj Dubai community. The urban business, residential, and entertainment district will house the soon-to-open Dubai Mall—the largest in the world at more than 12 million square feet—and several low-rise, Arabic-styled residential communities. www.burjdubai.com. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

But the era of \"the glorious eighteenth\" was short-lived; in 1800, the Act of Union brought Ireland and Britain together into the United Kingdom, and power moved to London.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The 19th century proved to be a time of political turmoil, although Daniel O\'Connell, the first Catholic lord mayor of Dublin, won early success with the introduction of Catholic Emancipation in 1829. During the late 1840s, Dublin escaped the worst effects of the famine that ravaged much of southern and western Ireland.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city entered another period of upheaval in the first decades of the 20th century, marked by the Easter Uprising of 1916. A war for independence from Britain began in 1919, followed by establishment of the Irish Free State in December 1921 and subsequent civil war. In its aftermath Dublin entered an era of political and cultural conservatism, which continued until the late 1970s. A major turning point occurred in 1972, when Ireland joined the European Economic Community.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the 1980s, while the economy remained in recession, Irish musicians stormed the American and British barricades of rock-and-roll music, with U2 climbing to the topmost heights.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The 1990s and first years of the 21st century have truly been Ireland\'s boom time, set in motion to a great extent by the country\'s participation in the European Union. When Ireland approved the new EU treaty in 1992, it was one of the poorest member nations, qualifying it for grants of all kinds.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ireland quickly transformed itself into the economic envy of the world, propelled by massive investment from multinational corporations, particularly in the telecommunications, software, and service industries. In 2000 the government announced that Ireland was the world\'s largest exporter of software. But the later years of the Tiger were fueled by a crazy property bubble and Dublin, like most of the world, suddenly woke up with one doozy of an economic hangover.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Today, roughly a third of the Irish Republic\'s 4.1 million people live in Dublin and its suburbs. It\'s a city of young people—astonishingly so (students from all over Ireland attend Trinity College and the city\'s dozen other universities). Many of them have their eyes feverishly focused on the future.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The National Gallery of Ireland—the first in a series of major civic buildings on the west side of Merrion Square—is one of Europe\'s finest smaller art museums—with \"smaller\" being a relative term: the collection holds more than 2,500 paintings and some 10,000 other works. But unlike Europe\'s largest art museums, the National Gallery can be thoroughly covered in a morning or afternoon without inducing exhaustion. An 1854 Act of Parliament provided for the establishment of the museum, which was helped along by William Dargan (1799-1867), who was responsible for building much of Ireland\'s rail network (he is honored by a statue on the front lawn). The 1864 building was designed by Francis Fowke, who was also responsible for London\'s Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A highlight of the museum is the major collection of paintings by Irish artists from the 17th through 20th centuries, including works by Roderic O\'Conor (1860-1940), Sir William Orpen (1878-1931), and William Leech (1881-1968). The Yeats Museum section contains works by members of the Yeats family. Jack B. Yeats (1871-1957), the brother of writer W. B. Yeats, is by far the best-known Irish painter of the 20th century. Yeats painted portraits and landscapes in an abstract Expressionist style not unlike that of the Bay Area Figurative painters of the 1950s and \'60s. His <i>The Liffey Swim</i> (1923) is particularly worth seeing for its Dublin subject matter (the annual swim is still held, usually on the first weekend in September).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The collection also claims exceptional paintings from the 17th-century French, Dutch, Italian, and Spanish schools. Among the highlights are Rembrandt\'s <i>Rest on the Flight into Egypt</i> (1647), Poussin\'s <i>The Holy Family</i> (1649) and <i>Lamentation over the Dead Christ</i> (circa 1655-60), and Goya\'s <i>Portrait of Doña Antonia Zárate</i> (circa 1810). Don\'t miss the portrait of the <i>First Earl of Bellamont</i> (1773) by Sir Joshua Reynolds; the earl was among the first to introduce the Georgian fashion to Ireland, and this portrait flaunts the extraordinary style of the man himself. The French Impressionists are represented with paintings by Monet, Sisley, and Renoir. The British collection and the Irish National Portrait collection are displayed in the north wing of the gallery, while the Millennium Wing, a standout of postmodern architecture in Dublin, houses part of the permanent collection and also stages major international traveling exhibits. The amply stocked gift shop is a good place to pick up books on Irish artists. Free guided tours are available on Saturday at 3 and on Sunday at 2, 3, and 4. www.nationalgallery.ie.

The architect showed off his dramatic flair in the rustic grotto and cascade, the sunken panels of lawn with their fountains, the blooming rosarium, and wonderful little wooded areas. This public park has no playground, but kids really love the \"secret garden\" feel to the place and the fact that the waterfall has rocks from every one of Ireland\'s 32 counties. Restoration of the gardens began in 1995 and has left the city with a Victorian treasure complete with a perfect box hedge and a working sundial. Access is from Hatch Street. COST: Free. OPEN: Daily 8-sunset. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Malahide Castle</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Malahide is chiefly known for its glorious Malahide Castle, a picture-book castle occupied by the Talbot family from 1185 until 1976, when it was sold to the Dublin County Council. The great expanse of parkland around the castle has more than 5,000 different species of trees and shrubs, all clearly labeled. The castle itself combines styles and crosses centuries; the earliest section, the three-story tower house, dates from the 12th century. Hung with many family portraits, the medieval great hall is the only one in Ireland that is preserved in its original form. Authentic 18th-century pieces furnish the other rooms. Within the castle, the <b>Fry Model Railway Museum</b> houses rare, handmade models of the Irish railway and one of the world\'s largest miniature railway displays, which covers an area of 2,500 square feet. Tara\'s Palace, a dollhouse that was made to raise funds for children\'s charities, is also here; it has 25 rooms, all fully furnished in miniature. www.malahidecastle.com.

(The other is Christ Church, and the reason Dublin has two cathedrals is because St. Patrick\'s originally stood outside the walls of Dublin, while its close neighbor was within the walls and belonged to the see of Dublin.) Legend has it that in the 5th century St. Patrick baptized many converts at a well on the site of the cathedral. The original building, dedicated in 1192 and early English Gothic in style, was an unsuccessful attempt to assert supremacy over Christ Church Cathedral. At 305 feet, this is the longest church in the country, a fact Oliver Cromwell\'s troops—no friends to the Irish—found useful as they made the church\'s nave into their stable in the 17th century. They left the building in a terrible state; its current condition is largely due to the benevolence of Sir Benjamin Guinness—of the brewing family—who started financing major restoration work in 1860.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Make sure you see the gloriously heraldic Choir of St. Patrick\'s, hung with colorful medieval banners, and find the tomb of the most famous of St. Patrick\'s many illustrious deans, Jonathan Swift, immortal author of <i>Gulliver\'s Travels,</i> who held office from 1713 to 1745. Swift\'s tomb is in the south aisle, not far from that of his beloved \"Stella,\" Mrs. Esther Johnson. Swift\'s epitaph is inscribed over the robing-room door. W. B. Yeats—who translated it thus: \"Swift has sailed into his rest; Savage indignation there cannot lacerate his breast\"—declared it the greatest epitaph of all time. Other memorials include the 17th-century Boyle Monument, with its numerous painted figures of family members, and the monument to Turlough O\'Carolan, the last of the Irish bards and one of the country\'s finest harp players. Immediately north of the cathedral is a small park, with statues of many of Dublin\'s literary figures and St. Patrick\'s Well. \"Living Stones\" is the cathedral\'s permanent exhibition celebrating St. Patrick\'s place in the life of the city. If you\'re a music lover, you\'re in for a treat; matins (9:40 AM) and evensong (5:45 PM) are still sung on many days. www.stpatrickscathedral.ie. COST: EUR 5.50.

After a long period of decline, it became a private park in 1814—the first time in its history that it was closed to the public. Its fortunes changed again in 1880, when Sir Arthur Guinness (a member of the Guinness brewery family who was later known as Lord Ardiluan), paid for it to be laid out anew. Flower gardens, formal lawns, a Victorian bandstand, and an ornamental lake with lots of waterfowl are all within the park\'s borders, connected by paths guaranteeing that strolling here or just passing through will offer up unexpected delights (such as palm trees). Among the park\'s many statues are a memorial to W. B. Yeats and another to Joyce by Henry Moore, and the <i>Three Fates,</i> a dramatic group of bronze female figures watching over human destiny. In the 18th century the walk on the north side of the green was referred to as the Beaux Walk because most of Dublin\'s gentlemen\'s clubs were in town houses here. Today it\'s dominated by the legendary Shelbourne hotel. On the south side is the alluring Georgian-gorgeous Newman House. COST: Free.

The city\'s calendar of cultural festivals, including the famous Edinburgh International Festival, is outstanding.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The power and the glory:</b> History plays out before your eyes in this centuries-old capital, along the Royal Mile or farther afield. Edinburgh Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse were the locations for some of the most important struggles between Scotland and England.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Awe-inspiring architecture:</b> From the Old Town\'s labyrinthine medieval streets to the neoclassical orderliness of the New Town to imaginative modern developments like the Scottish Parliament, the architecture of Auld Reekie spans the ages.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Food, glorious food:</b> Edinburgh has sophisticated restaurants serving cuisines from around the world. Perhaps the most exotic, however, is genuine Scottish cuisine, with its classic dishes like Cullen skink and haggis with neeps and tatties.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Retail therapy:</b> Scotland has a strong tradition of distinctive furniture makers, silversmiths, and artists. Look to the \"villages\" of Edinburgh—such as Stockbridge—for exclusive designer clothing, edgy knitwear, and other high-end items.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Leith, Edinburgh\'s Seaport</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Edinburgh\'s port has a rich history all of its own. While not as rambunctious as it used to be, Leith is still a good bet for an authentically Scottish night out. Ample restaurants and bars make this a good alternative to staying in the center of town.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just north of the city, Leith sits on the south shore of the Firth of Forth and was a separate town until it merged with the city in 1920. After World War II and up until the 1980s, the declining seaport had a reputation for poverty and crime. In recent years, however, it has been revitalized with the restoration of commercial buildings as well as the construction of new luxury housing, bringing a buzz of trendiness. All of the docks have been redeveloped; the Old East and West docks are now the administrative headquarters of the Scottish Executive.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In earlier times, Leith was the stage for many historic happenings. In 1560 Mary of Guise, the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots, ruled Scotland from Leith; her daughter landed in Leith the following year to embark on her infamous reign. A century later, Cromwell led his troops to Leith to root out Scots royalists. An arch of the Leith Citadel reminds all of the Scots\' victory. Leith also prides itself on being a \"home of golf\" because official rules to the game were devised in 1744, in what is today Links Park. The rolling green mounds here hide the former field and cannon sites of past battles.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\'s worth exploring the lowest reaches of the Water of Leith (the river that flows through the town), an area where restaurants, shops, and pubs proliferate. The major attraction for visitors here is the former royal yacht <i>Britannia, </i> moored outside the huge Ocean Terminal shopping mall. Reach Leith by walking down Leith Street and Leith Walk, from the east end of Princes Street (20 to 30 minutes) or take Lothian Bus 22 (Britannia Ocean Drive, Leith).</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Edinburgh Today</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Today the city is the second most important financial center in the United Kingdom, and the fifth most important in Europe. The city regularly is ranked near the top in quality-of-life surveys. Accordingly, New Town apartments on fashionable streets sell for considerable sums. In some senses the city is showy and materialistic, but Edinburgh still supports learned societies, some of which have their roots in the Scottish Enlightenment. The Royal Society of Edinburgh, for example, established in 1783 \"for the advancement of learning and useful knowledge,\" remains an important forum for interdisciplinary activities.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Even as Edinburgh moves through the 21st century, its tall guardian castle remains the focal point of the city and its venerable history. Take time to explore the streets—peopled by the spirits of Mary, Queen of Scots; Sir Walter Scott; and Robert Louis Stevenson—and pay your respects to the world\'s best-loved terrier, Greyfriars Bobby. In the evenings you can enjoy candlelit restaurants or a folk <i>ceilidh (</i>a traditional Scottish dance with music, pronounced<i>kay-lee), </i> though you should remember that you haven\'t earned your porridge until you\'ve climbed Arthur\'s Seat. Should you wander around a corner, say, on George Street, you might see not an endless cityscape, but blue sea and a patchwork of fields. This is the county of Fife, beyond the inlet of the North Sea called the Firth of Forth—a reminder, like the mountains to the northwest that can be glimpsed from Edinburgh\'s highest points, that the rest of Scotland lies within easy reach.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Dan Brown\'s bestselling novel <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> has made visiting this Episcopal chapel (services continue to be held here) an imperative stop for many of its enthusiasts. Whether you\'re a fan of the book or not—and of the book\'s theory that the chapel has a secret sign that can lead you to the Holy Grail—this is a site of immense interest. Originally conceived by Sir William Sinclair (circa 1404-80) and dedicated to St. Matthew in 1446, the chapel is outstanding for the quality and variety of the carving inside. Covering almost every square inch of stonework are human figures, animals, and plants. The meaning of these remains subject to many theories; some depict symbols from the medieval order of the Knights Templar and from Freemasonry. The chapel\'s design called for a cruciform structure, but only the choir and parts of the east transept walls were completed. www.rosslynchapel.com. COST: £7.50.

At this writing, part of the museum is slated to be closed for renovations until 2011. The redevelopment will free up more space for exhibitions, but the architectural character of the complex—including the impressive main hall, with its soaring roof and bird-cage design—will remain intact. There is still plenty to see before the complex reopens, including Viking brooches, Pictish stones, Jacobite relics, machinery, and Queen Mary\'s <i>clarsach</i> (harp). www.nms.ac.uk. COST: Free.

There\'s so much to see that you need at least three hours to do the site justice, especially if you\'re interested in military sites.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You enter across the <b>Esplanade,</b> the huge forecourt built in the 18th century as a parade ground. The area comes alive with color and music each August when it\'s used for the Military Tattoo, a festival of magnificently outfitted marching bands and regiments. Heading over the drawbridge and through the gatehouse, past the guards, you can find the rough stone walls of the <b>Half-Moon Battery,</b> where the one-o\'clock gun is fired every day in an impressively anachronistic ceremony; these curving ramparts give Edinburgh Castle its distinctive appearance from miles away. Climb up through a second gateway and you come to the oldest surviving building in the complex, the tiny 11th-century <b>St. Margaret\'s Chapel,</b> named in honor of Saxon queen Margaret (1046-93), who had persuaded her husband, King Malcolm III (circa 1031-93), to move his court from Dunfermline to Edinburgh. Edinburgh\'s environs—the Lothians—were occupied by Anglian settlers with whom the queen felt more at home, or so the story goes (Dunfermline was surrounded by Celts). The <b>Crown Room,</b> a must-see, contains the \"Honours of Scotland\"—the crown, scepter, and sword that once graced the Scottish monarch. Upon the <b>Stone of Scone,</b> also in the Crown Room, Scottish monarchs once sat to be crowned. In the section now called <b>Queen Mary\'s Apartments,</b> Mary, Queen of Scots, gave birth to James VI of Scotland. The <b>Great Hall</b> displays arms and armor under an impressive vaulted, beamed ceiling. Scottish parliament meetings were conducted here until 1840.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Military features of interest include the <b>Scottish National War Memorial,</b> the <b>Scottish United Services Museum,</b> and the famous 15th-century Belgian-made cannon <i>Mons Meg.</i> This enormous piece of artillery has been silent since 1682, when it exploded while firing a salute for the duke of York; it now stands in an ancient hall behind the Half-Moon Battery. Contrary to what you may hear from locals, it\'s not <i>Mons Meg</i> but the battery\'s gun that goes off with a bang every weekday at 1 PM, frightening visitors and reminding Edinburghers to check their watches. www.edinburghcastle.gov.uk.

Built in the Fez River\'s fertile basin—the Oued Fez, also known as Oued el-Yawahir, the River of Pearls—Fez el Bali (literally, Fez the Old) was founded in AD 808 by Moulay Idriss II, son of Morocco\'s founder, Moulay Idriss I. The medina is divided into two quarters on either side of the Fez River. The Andalusian Quarter originally housed refugees from Moorish Spain, who had begun to flee the Christian Reconquest; the Kairaouine Quarter originally housed refugees from Kairaouine, Tunisia, who fled westward in search of a purer form of Islamic worship. Always the more important of the two demographically and commercially, the Kairaouine Quarter was especially expanded under the Merenid dynasty, during Fez\'s 14th-century golden age. Fez el Djedid (New Fez) was founded in 1276 by the Merenid rulers, who needed extra space for their palaces as well as a sense of distance from the population itself. The original and the most imperial of Morocco\'s Imperial Cities, Fez was the nation\'s capital in the 9th, 12th-14th, and 16th centuries. The Ville Nouvelle was built by the French after they established their protectorate in 1912.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Touring the Meknes Souk</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Meknes souk, as with Meknes generally, seems somehow easier to embrace than vast Fez. Getting lost here is difficult; it just isn\'t that big. Beginning from the Place el-Hedim, just past the ceramics stands, a narrow corridor leads into the <b>food souk,</b> a riotous display of everything from spices to fruit to multicolor olives. Work through the souk and emerge from the far-right corner; through the bird market outside and back to your right, in a corner, you\'ll find the fish market.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Continue right around the building, pass to the left of Dar Jamai, and you\'ll enter the Meknes souk. Continue straight in until you come to a T—on the left is a usually boisterous public auction area. The street crossing the T is the main artery through the souk. A left turn will take you through the <b>Souk Nejjarine,</b> the woodworkers\' souk, and then into the rug and carpet souk. Farther on in this direction is the <b>Souk Bezzarine,</b> a general flea market along the medina walls. Farther up to the right are basket makers, iron smiths, leather workers, and saddle makers, and, near <b>Bab el Djedid,</b> makers of tents and musical instruments.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A right turn at the T will take you through <b>Souk es Sebat</b> and the souk\'s more formal section, beginning with the <i>babouche</i> (leather-slipper) market. At the first right, take a quick look at an ancient fondouk, now in ruins.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Back on the main street you\'ll pass <b>Fondouk Oueda</b> on the left, and, shortly thereafter, the <b>Bou Inania Medersa.</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once again back on the main thoroughfare through the souk, you\'ll pass one of the mosque\'s 12 doors before reaching the <b>camel-meat vendor</b> on a left-hand corner at stall No. 15, identifiable by the toy camel hanging in front of his stand. The butcher is more than willing to open his refrigerator and haul out a camel head in case you have any doubts.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Turn left here, leaving the main street, and take an immediate right. On the left you\'ll see a brass door surrounded by colorful ornamentation; this is an old fondouk. Farther down on the left, at No. 91, is a <b>beignet,</b> a maker of fritters, or doughnuts, one of the few of these traditional artisans remaining. You will now be hit by a powerfully milky aroma from the <i>laiterie</i> (dairy shop) on the right-hand corner; this is a signal to turn right and proceed down into <b>Place du Murier</b> (named for its mulberry tree), where a 1,000-year-old mulberry, gnarled and about 3 feet in diameter, stands in the middle of what was once the salt vendors\' souk. On the right, where he\'s seated in a bucket car seat at stall No. 27, meet celebrated zellij-tile artisan <b>Ben Adada,</b> whose father was also a well-known zellij maker and whose grandfather was one of the master craftsmen of Moulay Ismail\'s Royal Palace.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Turn right just past Ben Adada\'s place (taking a look left into the ancient wood-burning public bakery as you leave the square) and follow signs to the <b>Palais des Idrissides,</b> a wonderful 14th-century palace and carpet emporium.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The Royal Granaries were designed to store grain as feed for the 12,000 horses in the royal stables—not just for a few days or weeks but over a 20-year siege if necessary. Ismail and his engineers counted on three things to keep the granaries cool enough that the grain would never rot: thick walls (12 feet), suspended gardens (a cedar forest was planted on the roof), and an underground reservoir with water ducts under the floors. The room on the far right as you enter has a 30-foot well in its center and a towpath around it—donkeys circulated constantly, activating the waterwheel in the well, which forced water through the ducts and maintained a stable temperature in the granaries. Out behind the granaries are the remains of the royal stables (the roofs were lost in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake). Some 1,200 purebreds, just one-tenth of Moulay Ismail\'s cavalry, were kept here. At a point just to the left of the door out to the stables, you can see the stunning symmetry of the stable\'s pillars from three different perspectives. COST: 20 DH.

In 1491 he became prior of the convent of San Marco, where he adopted a life of austerity and delivered sermons condemning Florence\'s excesses and the immorality of his fellow clergy. Following the death of Lorenzo de\' Medici, Savonarola was instrumental in the formation of the republic of Florence, ruled by a representative council with Christ enthroned as monarch. In one of his most memorable acts, he urged Florentines to toss worldly possessions—from frilly dresses to Botticelli paintings—onto a \"bonfire of the vanities\" in Piazza della Signoria. Savonarola\'s antagonism toward church hierarchy led to his undoing: he was excommunicated in 1497, and the following year was hanged and burned on charges of heresy. Today, at the Museo di San Marco, you can visit Savonarola\'s cell and see his arresting portrait.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Eating and Drinking Well in Florence</h1><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Classic Antipasto: Crostini di Fegatini</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This beloved dish consists of a chicken liver spread, served warm or at room temperature, on toasted, garlic-rubbed bread. It can be served smooth, like a pâté, or in a rougher spread. It\'s made by sautéeing chicken livers with finely diced carrot and onion, enlivened with the addition of wine, broth, or Marsala reductions, and mashed anchovies and capers.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Classic Secondo: Bistecca Fiorentina</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The town\'s culinary pride and joy is a thick slab of beef, resembling a T-bone steak, from large white oxen called Chianina. The meat\'s slapped on the grill and served rare, sometimes with a pinch of salt. It\'s always seared on both sides, and just barely cooked inside (experts say five minutes per side, and then fifteen minutes with the bone sitting perpendicularly on the grill). To ask for it more well done is to incur disdain; some restaurants simply won\'t serve it any other way than rare.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Classic Contorno: Cannellini Beans</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Simply boiled, they provide the perfect accompaniment to a bistecca. The small white beans are best when they go straight from the garden into the pot. They should be annointed with a generous outpouring of Tuscan olive oil; the combination is oddly felicitous, and it goes a long way toward explaining why Tuscans are referred to as <i>mangiafagioli</i> (bean eaters) by other Italians.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Classic Dolce: Biscotti di Prato</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">These are sometimes the only dessert on offer, and are more or less an afterthought to the glories that have preceeded them. \"Biscotti\" means twice-cooked (or, in this case, twice baked) hard almond cookies which soften considerably when dipped languidly into <i>vin santo</i> (\"holy wine\"), a sweet dessert wine, or into a simple <i>caffè</i>.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Classic Wine: Chianti Classico</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This blend from the region just south of Florence relies mainly on the local, hardy sangiovese grape; it\'s aged for at least one year before hitting the market. (<i>Riserve</i>—reserves—are aged at least an additional six months.) Chianti is usually the libation of choice for Florentines, and it pairs magnificently with grilled foods and seasonal vegetables. Traditionalists opt for the younger, fruitier (and usually less expensive) versions often served in straw flasks. You can sample <i>Chianti classico</i> all over town, and buy it in local <i>salumerie, enoteche,</i> and supermarkets.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The immense Duomo was not completed until 1436, the year it was consecrated. The imposing facade dates only from the 19th century; its neo-Gothic style complements Giotto\'s genuine Gothic 14th-century campanile. The real glory of the Duomo, however, is Filippo Brunelleschi\'s dome, presiding over the cathedral with a dignity and grace that few domes to this day can match. Brunelleschi\'s <b>cupola</b> was an ingenious engineering feat. The space to be enclosed by the dome was so large and so high above the ground that traditional methods of dome construction—wooden centering and scaffolding—were of no use whatsoever. So Brunelleschi developed entirely new building methods, which he implemented with equipment of his own design (including a novel scaffolding method). Beginning work in 1420, he built not one dome but two, one inside the other, and connected them with common ribbing that stretched across the intervening empty space, thereby considerably lessening the crushing weight of the structure. He also employed a new method of bricklaying, based on an ancient Roman herringbone pattern, interlocking each course of bricks with the course below in a way that made the growing structure self-supporting. The result was one of the great engineering breakthroughs of all time: most of Europe\'s later domes, including that of St. Peter\'s in Rome, were built employing Brunelleschi\'s methods, and today the Duomo has come to symbolize Florence in the same way that the Eiffel Tower symbolizes Paris. The Florentines are justly proud of it, and to this day the Florentine phrase for \"homesick\" is nostalgia del cupolone (homesick for the dome). The interior is a fine example of Florentine Gothic. Much of the cathedral\'s best-known art has been moved to the nearby Museo dell\'Opera del Duomo. Notable among the works that remain, however, are two massive equestrian frescoes honoring famous soldiers: Niccolò da Tolentino, painted in 1456 by Andrea del Castagno (circa 1419-57), and Sir John Hawkwood, painted 20 years earlier by Paolo Uccello (1397-1475); both are on the left-hand wall of the nave. A 1995 restoration repaired the dome and cleaned the vastly crowded fresco of the Last Judgment, executed by Giorgio Vasari (1511-74) and Zuccaro, on its interior. Originally Brunelleschi wanted mosaics to cover the interior of the great ribbed cupola, but by the time the Florentines got around to commissioning the decoration, 150 years later, tastes had changed. Too bad: it\'s a fairly dreadful Last Judgment and hardly worth the effort of craning your neck to see it. Yours truly, can explore the upper and lower reaches of the cathedral. The remains of a Roman wall and an 11th-century cemetery have been excavated beneath the nave; the way down is near the first pier on the right. The <b>climb to the top of the dome</b> (463 steps) is not for the faint of heart, but the view is superb. www.operaduomo.firenze.it. COST: Church free, crypt EUR 3, cupola EUR 6.

As a burial place, the church probably contains more skeletons of Renaissance celebrities than any other in Italy. The tomb of Michelangelo is on the right at the front of the basilica; he is said to have chosen this spot so that the first thing he would see on Judgment Day, when the graves of the dead fly open, would be Brunelleschi\'s dome through Santa Croce\'s open doors. The tomb of Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) is on the left wall; he was not granted a Christian burial until 100 years after his death because of his controversial contention that Earth is not the center of the universe. The tomb of Niccolò Machiavelli (1469-1527), the political theoretician whose brutally pragmatic philosophy so influenced the Medici, is halfway down the nave on the right. The grave of Lorenzo Ghiberti, creator of the Baptistery doors, is halfway down the nave on the left. Composer Gioacchino Rossini (1792-1868) is buried at the end of the nave on the right. The monument to Dante Alighieri (1265-1321), Italy\'s greatest poet, is a memorial rather than a tomb (he is buried in Ravenna); it\'s on the right wall near the tomb of Michelangelo.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The collection of art within the complex is by far the most important of any church in Florence. The most famous works are probably the Giotto frescoes in the two chapels immediately to the right of the high altar. They illustrate scenes from the lives of Saint John the Evangelist and Saint John the Baptist (in the right-hand chapel) and scenes from the life of Saint Francis (in the left-hand chapel). Time has not been kind to these frescoes; through the centuries, wall tombs were placed in the middle of them, they were whitewashed and plastered over, and in the 19th century they suffered a clumsy restoration. But the reality that Giotto introduced into painting can still be seen. He did not paint beautifully stylized religious icons, as the Byzantine style that preceded him prescribed; he instead painted drama—Saint Francis surrounded by grieving friars at the very moment of his death. This was a radical shift in emphasis: before Giotto, painting\'s role was to symbolize the attributes of God; after him, it was to imitate life. His work is indeed primitive compared with later painting, but in the early 14th century it caused a sensation that was not equaled for another 100 years. He was, for his time, the equal of both Masaccio and Michelangelo.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Among the church\'s other highlights are Donatello\'s <i>Annunciation,</i> a moving expression of surprise (on the right wall two-thirds of the way down the nave); 14th-century frescoes by Taddeo Gaddi (circa 1300-66) illustrating scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, clearly showing the influence of Giotto (in the chapel at the end of the right transept); and Donatello\'s <i>Crucifix,</i> criticized by Brunelleschi for making Christ look like a peasant (in the chapel at the end of the left transept). Outside the church proper, in the <b>Museo dell\'Opera di Santa Croce</b> off the cloister, is the 13th-century <i>Triumphal Cross</i> by Cimabue (circa 1240-1302), badly damaged by the flood of 1966. A model of architectural geometry, the Cappella Pazzi, at the end of the cloister, was designed by Brunelleschi, who did not live to see it finished. COST: Church and museum EUR 5.

Donated to the city by Edison\'s widow, his 12-acre estate is a remarkable place with three homes, a laboratory, botanical gardens, and a museum. Here you can see many of his inventions, along with historic photographs and memorabilia. The laboratory is just as Edison left it when he died in 1931. Edison traveled south from New Jersey and devoted much of his time here to inventing things (there are 1,093 patents to his name), experimenting with rubber for friend and frequent visitor Harvey Firestone, and planting some 600 species of plants collected around the world. Next door to Edison\'s two identical homes is Ford\'s \"Mangoes,\" the more modest seasonal home of Edison\'s fellow inventor. It\'s said that the V-8 engine in essence was designed on the back porch. The property\'s oldest building, the Caretaker\'s House, dates to 1860. Research garden renovation is ongoing.

Taverns serve this special cider from fat-bellied blue stoneware pitchers, called Bembels, and the glasses, usually with a crest, are ribbed to give them \"traction.\" (In the old days, when people used knives and forks less often, this was good for preventing the glass from slipping from greasy hands).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Apfelwein is a part of the life of Frankfurt. On weekends a colorfully painted old streetcar called the Ebbelwoi Express makes the rounds of Frankfurt\'s tourist sights. A bottle of Apfelwein, a pretzel, and schmaltzy music are included in the price.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To produce Apfelwein, juice from pressed apples is fermented for approximately eight weeks. Some people find it rather sour and mix it with sparkling water (called <i>sauergespritzt,</i> or \"sour\") or with lemonade (called <i>süssgespritzt,</i> or \"sweet\"). You can also get sweet cider, known as <i>Süsser.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Locals will be impressed, and may even tell you so, if they see you try it straight.

The last decade has seen the completion of various \"way-marked\" (signposted) walking routes. Better, there are also several new tour operators specializing in customized walking holidays, providing accommodation and a guide, or annotated walking maps. If you like challenging hills and relatively rough terrain, the West is excellent hiking country. The unusual, almost lunar landscape of the Burren in County Clare is less demanding than the terrain in Connemara. Here, and in the area north of Connemara in south County Mayo, the countryside is sparsely populated and subject to sudden changes in weather, usually a shower of rain. There are four signposted trails in the area, but it\'s always advisable to buy a good map locally before setting out. The <b>Burren Way</b> runs from Lahinch to Ballyvaughan on the shores of Galway Bay, a distance of 35 km (22 mi). The most spectacular part of the trail runs along the top of the Cliffs of Moher from Doolin to the coast near Lisdoonvarna, a distance of about 5 km (3 mi). The trails continue through the heart of the Burren\'s gray, rocky limestone landscape, with ever-changing views offshore of the Aran Islands and Galway Bay. The <b>Western Way\'s County Galway section</b> extends from Ougheterard on Lough Corrib through the mountains of Connemara to Leenane on Killary Harbour, a distance of 50 km (30 mi). Its 177-km (110-mi) County Mayo section, known as the Western Way (Mayo), continues past Killary Harbor to Westport on Clew Bay to the Ox Mountains east of Ballina; this trail includes some of the finest mountain and coastal scenery in Ireland. A new, 224-km (140-mi) hiking route, <i>slí Chonamara,</i> through Irish-speaking Connemara, stretches along the shores of Galway Bay from An Spidéal to Carraroe, Carna, Letterfrack, and Recess.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Shopping Tour of Galway</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There\'s no question about it: they have a different look in Galway. People have always dressed differently, because they dress for the Galway weather, which can be wet and windy at any time of year. But ever since Galway was transformed by Ireland\'s \"Celtic Tiger\" economic boom, they have also dressed—and decorated—with a real sense of style. Want proof? Just join the locals on the following walk.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pick up a free map of Galway from the swanky new <b>Tourist Information Office</b> on Forster Place. Turn left out the front door to reach the <b>Hotel</b> Meyrick (formerly the Great Southern)<b>,</b> a monumental 19th-century grande dame in cut stone (its lobby is just the place for \"scene-iors\" to take their coffee or tea). Turn left beyond the hotel and right into Merchants Road to find the lively <b>Bold Art Gallery.</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Then turn left into <b>Flood Street,</b> the heart of medieval Galway, a tiny area where all the cutest shops are jam-packed together, including <b>Cobwebs,</b> abrim with offbeat antique jewelry, old binoculars, and bronze model airplanes. For a feel of the essential Galway, cross the road to the banks of the <b>River Corrib</b> and walk to your left to the <b>Spanish Arch.</b> When natives feel homesick, this is the view they think of: white water breaking on the dark surface of the swift-flowing Corrib, the fishing boats of the Claddagh, and as many as a hundred swans floating by.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Staying on this side of the Corrib, cross over the bridge and take the riverside footpath past the contempo Jurys Inn and some old warehouses. Turn left over O\'Brien\'s Bridge for the historic <b>Bridge Mills,</b> now outfitted with a designer swap shop, a fun florist-cum-café, and <b>Sam Beardon, Sculptor and Jeweller.</b> Continue along Bridge Street, turning right into Cross Street and right into Kirwan\'s Lane. Here, <b>Design Concourse Ireland/Judy Greene Pottery</b> has locally made turned-wood objects, basketware, and perfumery.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Medieval Kirwan\'s Lane leads you on to Quay Street and <b>Twice as Nice,</b> a vintage and antique clothing boutique with old Irish linen. Continue up High Street to <b>Faller\'s Sweaters and Tweeds,</b> just the place to buy an Aran sweater, and <b>The Kilkenny Shop,</b> Galway\'s largest emporium of Irish-designed products, with a dazzling selection of chic John Rocha crystal, Newbridge Silver, and Nicholas Mosse pottery.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Farther up on the right, <b>Maille</b> has some great mohair wraps and <i>the</i> essential Galway fashion item, a Jack Murphy raincoat. Choose between a short version or a caped version (for those really wet days)—top one off with a rainproof Stetson with a feather in it and you\'ll pass for a local.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">High Street leads into William Street, where you\'ll find <b>The Treasure Chest,</b> a three-story shop selling upmarket Irish goods. Its exterior, painted in Wedgwood blue with white swags, just like the famous china, is a favorite with photographers. <b>Brown Thomas,</b> on William at the corner of Eglinton, has long been Galway\'s most upscale department store.

The dark, deep water of the fjord reflects the magnificent steep-sided hills that border it, creating a haunting scene of natural grandeur. The harbor has an extremely safe anchorage, 13 fathoms (78 feet) deep for almost its entire length, and is sheltered from storms by mountain walls. The rafts floating in Killary Harbour belong to fish-farming consortia that raise salmon and trout in cages beneath the water. This is a matter of some controversy all over the West. Although some people welcome the employment opportunities, others bemoan the visual blight of the rafts. From April through October <b>Killary Cruises</b> (Nancy\'s Point, 2 km [1 mi] west of Leenane on N59 Clifden Rd.tel. 091/566-736. COST: EUR 21. www.killarycruises.com) runs 90-minute trips around Killary Harbour in an enclosed catamaran launch with seating for 150 passengers, plus a bar and restaurant. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kylemore Abbey</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kylemore Abbey, one of the most photographed castles in all of Ireland, is visible across a reedy lake with a backdrop of wooded hillside. The vast Gothic-Revival, turreted, gray-stone castle was built as a private home between 1861 and 1868 by Mitchell Henry, a member of parliament for County Galway, and his wife, Margaret, who had fallen in love with the spot during a carriage ride while on their honeymoon. The Henrys spared no expense—the final bill for their house is said to have come to 1.5 million—and employed mostly local laborers, thereby abetting the famine relief effort (this area was among the worst hit in all of Ireland). Adjacent to the house is a spectacular neo-Gothic chapel, which, sadly, became the burial place for Margaret, who died after contracting \"Nile fever\" on a trip to Egypt. In 1920, nuns from the Irish Abbey of the Nuns of St. Benedict, who fled their abbey in Belgium during World War I, eventually sought refuge in Kylemore, which had gone through a number of owners and decades of decline after the Henrys died. Still in residence, the Benedictine nuns run a girls\' boarding school here. Three reception rooms and the main hall are open to the public, as are a crafts center and cafeteria. There\'s also a 6-acre walled Victorian garden; a shuttle bus from the abbey to the garden departs every 15 minutes during opening hours. An exhibition and video explaining the history of the house can be viewed year-round at the abbey, and the grounds are freely accessible most of the year. Ask at the excellent crafts shop for directions to the <b>Gothic Chapel</b> (a five-minute walk from the abbey), a tiny replica of Norwich Cathedral built by the Henrys. www.kylemoreabbey.com. COST: EUR 12, including shuttle bus to garden. OPEN: Crafts shop, grounds, and cafeteria daily 10-6; exhibition and garden mid-Mar.-mid-Oct., daily 10-4:30. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museum of Country Life</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To understand the forces that have led to such dramatic changes in Turlough, pay a visit to the Museum of Country Life, which focuses on rural Ireland between 1860 and 1960—a way of life that remained unchanged for many years, then suddenly came to an end within living memory. At this highly acclaimed museum, the only branch of the National Museum of Ireland outside Dublin, you\'re invited to imagine yourself back in a vanished world, before the internal combustion engine, rural electrification, indoor plumbing, television, and increased education transformed people\'s lives and expectations. For many, this is a journey into a strange place, where water had to be carried from a well, turf had to be brought home from the bog, fires had to be lighted daily for heat and cooking, and clothes had to be made painstakingly by hand in the long winter evenings. Among the displayed items are authentic furniture and utensils; hunting, fishing, and agricultural implements; clothing; and objects relating to games, pastimes, religion, and education.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The museum experience starts in Turlough Park House, built in the High Victorian Gothic style in 1865 and set in pretty lakeside gardens. Just three rooms have been restored to illustrate the way the landowners lived. A sensational modern four-story, curved building houses the main exhibit. Cleverly placed windows afford panoramic views of the surrounding park and the distant round tower, allowing you to reflect on the reality beyond the museum\'s walls. Temporary exhibitions, such as one called \"Romanticism and Reality,\" help illustrate the divide between the dreamy image of old rural life and its actual hardships. The shop sells museum-branded and handcrafted gift items as well as a good selection of books on related topics. A café with indoor and outdoor tables is in the stable yard, and you can take scenic lakeside walks in the park. Crafts demonstrations and workshops take place on Wednesday and Sunday afternoons. www.museum.ie. COST: Free.

It remained a mere hamlet until 1754, when the Duke of Savoy, by then also King of Sardinia, annexed it with intent to create a rival commercial hub for Geneva. That never happened, courtesy of the French Revolution, but the town grew so fast that the royal planners in Turin drew up five separate development plans between 1772 and 1783; their harmonious architecture, plazas, and courtyard gardens still recall Mediterranean ways unheard of in Geneva. Colorful shop windows, sidewalk cafés, friendly restaurants, hole-in-the-wall galleries, tree-lined fruit-and-vegetable markets (on Wednesday and Saturday), open doors, and working artists infuse Rue St-Joseph, Rue Ancienne, Rue St-Victor, and Place du Marché with vibrant creative energy; don\'t miss the outdoor street fairs on the last weekend in August and mid-December.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Smaller statues of major Protestant figures, bas-reliefs, and inscriptions connected with the Reformation flank the lifelike giants as they hover over Bern, Geneva, and Edinburgh\'s coats of arms; Oliver Cromwell is surrounded by Pilgrims praying on the deck of the <i>Mayflower</i> and the 1689 presentation of the Bill of Rights to King William and Queen Mary by the English Houses of Parliament.

The sublime blend of basil, extra-virgin olive oil, garlic, pine nuts, and grated pecorino and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses that forms <i>pesto alla Genovese</i> is one of Italy\'s crowning culinary achievements, a concoction that Italian food guru Marcella Hazan has called \"the most seductive of all sauces for pasta.\" Ligurian pesto is served only over spaghetti, gnocchi, lasagna, or—most authentically—<i>trenette</i> (a flat, spaghetti-like pasta) or <i>trofie</i> (short, doughy pasta twists), and then typically mixed with boiled potatoes and green beans. Pesto is also occasionally used to flavor minestrone. The small-leaf basil grown in the region\'s sunny seaside hills is considered by many to be the best in the world, and pesto sauce was invented primarily as a showcase for that singular flavor. The simplicity and rawness of pesto is one of its virtues, as cooking (or even heating) basil ruins its delicate flavor. In fact, pesto aficionados refuse even to subject the basil leaves to an electric blender; Genovese (and other) foodies insist that true pesto can be made only with mortar and pestle.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The 17th-century palace—also known as Palazzo Balbi Durazzo—was built by the Balbi family, enormously wealthy Genovese merchants. Its regal pretensions were not lost on the Savoy, who bought the palace and turned it into a royal residence in the early 19th century. The gallery of mirrors and the ballroom on the upper floor are particularly decadent. Look for works by Sir Anthony Van Dyck, who lived in Genoa for six years, beginning in 1621, and painted many portraits of the Genovese nobility.

He is seeing his dream fulfilled as he creates huge concrete sculptures and sinks them in 45 feet of water off the north shore of Cayman Brac. The result is an astounding dive site and artificial reef with more than 100 sculptures covering several acres. The story starts at the Archway of Atlantis (each of the two bases weighs 21,000 pounds). The Elders\' Way, lined with 5-foot temple columns, leads to the Inner Circle of Light, where there is a sundial large enough to sit in. Each Elder is modeled after an actual person who has contributed to the Cayman Islands. Foots creates a beautiful story with his creation and is doing this almost entirely on his own; he\'s made an incredible donation to the divers of the Brac. Foots plans to add a new phase every six months so that the story will go on for a long time before the project is finished.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Learn to Dive</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Diving is an exciting experience that does not have to be strenuous or stressful. Almost anyone can enjoy scuba, and it\'s easy to test the waters via a three-hour resort course costing $100 to $120. After a quick rundown of dos and don\'ts, you stand in the shallow end of a pool, learning how to use the mask and fins and breathe underwater with a regulator. The instructor then explains some basic safety skills and before you know it, you\'re in the drink. The instructor hovers as you float above the reef, watching fish react to you. Don\'t worry—there are no dangerous fish in Cayman, and they don\'t bite (as long as you\'re not \"chumming,\" or handling fish food). You can see corals and sponges, maybe even a turtle or ray. It\'s an amazing world that you can enter with very little effort.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The resort course only permits shallow, instructor-guided dives in Cayman\'s calm, clear waters. The next step is full Open Water certification (generally three or four, including several dives, for around $450, less as part of a hotel package). This earns you a C-card, your passport to the underwater world anywhere you travel. From there, addicts will discover dozens of specialty courses. The leading teaching organizations, both with their adherents, are PADI (Professional Association of Dive Instructors) and NAUI (National Association of Underwater Instructors), affectionately nicknamed \"Not Another Underwater Idiot\" and \"Pay and Dive Immediately\" (those are the polite versions in scuba\'s colorful slang). Worry not: Cayman\'s instructors are among the world\'s best. And the water conditions just might spoil you.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Technical Diving</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Technical diving refers to advanced dives conducted beyond the 130-foot depth limit—requiring a decompression stop—or into an overhead environment. DiveTech\'s Nancy Easterbrook compares it to \"scaling a sheer cliff face. It takes practice and determination.\" The courses and equipment are also much more expensive. Terms you\'ll soon hear are Nitrox, Advanced Nitrox, Normoxic, Trimix, and Advanced Trimix. These all enable divers to explore deeper depths safely at greater length. Nitrox, for example, is highly oxygenated nitrogen (32% as opposed to \"normal\" air with 21%), which enables you to dive for a longer time before reaching decompression limits. And just like the oxygen bar craze of the last decade, Nitrox invigorates you, reducing fatigue after dives. Rebreather diving (Closed Circuit Rebreathers or CCR) is another popular way to extend dive time, up to three hours 100 feet down. You breathe warmer, moister air (reducing the chance of chills at lower depths). As a bonus, denizens of the deep are less wary as there are no bubbles.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

On a clear day you can see 7 mi (11 km) across to Cayman Brac. It serves as a green- and loggerhead turtle nesting site in spring, and a marvelous mosaic of coral gardens blooms just offshore. It\'s magical, especially at moonrise, when it earns its nickname, Lovers\' Beach. There\'s a palapa for shade, but no facilities. The current can be strong, so watch the kids carefully. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Seven Mile Beach</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Grand Cayman\'s west coast is dominated by the famous Seven Mile Beach—actually a 6½-mi-long (10-km-long) expanse of powdery white sand overseeing lapis water stippled with a rainbow of parasails and kayaks. The width of the beach varies with the season; toward the south end it narrows and disappears altogether south of the Marriott, leaving only rock and ironshore. It starts to broaden into its normal silky softness anywhere between Tarquyn Manor and the Reef Grill at Royal Palms. Free of litter and pesky peddlers, it\'s an unspoiled (though often crowded) environment. Most of the island\'s resorts, restaurants, and shopping centers sit along this strip. At the public beach toward the north end you can find chairs for rent ($10 for the day, including a beverage), a playground, water toys aplenty, two beach bars, restrooms, and showers. The best snorkeling is at either end, by the Marriott and Treasure Island or off the northern section called Cemetery Reef Beach. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This 65-acre wilderness preserve showcases a wide range of indigenous and nonindigenous tropical vegetation, approximately 2,000 species in total, with such splendid sections as a Heritage Garden that depicts Caymanian life a century ago and the nearly mile-long Woodland Trail, encompassing every Cayman ecosystem from wetland to cactus thicket. You\'ll encounter birds, lizards, turtles, agoutis, and more, but the park\'s star residents are the protected endemic blue iguanas, found only in Grand Cayman. The world\'s most endangered iguana, they\'re the focus of the National Trust\'s Blue Iguana Recovery Program, a captive breeding and reintroduction facility. This section of the park is usually closed to the general public, though released \"blue dragons\" hang out in the vicinity. The Trust conducts 90-minute behind-the-scenes safaris Monday—Saturday at 11 AM for $30. www.botanic-park.ky. COST: $10, children 12 and under free.

Today art books are devoted to his distinctive, astonishingly elegant Arts and Crafts- and art nouveau-influenced interiors, and artisans around the world look to his theory that \"decoration should not be constructed, rather construction should be decorated\" as holy law. Mackintosh\'s stripped-down designs ushered in the modern age with their deceptively stark style.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">An Architect\'s Career</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mackintosh trained in architecture at the Glasgow School of Art and was apprenticed to the Glasgow firm of John Hutchison at the age of 16. Early influences on his work included the Pre-Raphaelites, James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903), Aubrey Beardsley (1872-98), and Japanese art. But by the 1890s a distinct Glasgow style developed.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The building for the <i>Glasgow Herald</i> newspaper, which he designed in 1893 and which is now the Lighthouse Centre for Architecture, Design and the City, was soon followed by other major Glasgow buildings: Queen Margaret\'s Medical College; the Martyrs Public School; tearooms including the Willow Tearoom; the Hill House, in Helensburgh, now owned by the National Trust for Scotland; and Queen\'s Cross Church, completed in 1899 and now the headquarters of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society. In 1897 Mackintosh began work on a new home for the Glasgow School of Art, recognized as one of his major achievements.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mackintosh married Margaret Macdonald in 1900, and in later years her decorative work enhanced the interiors of his buildings. In 1904 he became a partner in Honeyman and Keppie and designed Scotland Street School, now the Scotland Street School Museum, in the same year. Until 1913, when he left Honeyman and Keppie and moved to England, Mackintosh\'s projects included buildings over much of Scotland. He preferred wherever possible to include interiors as part of his overall design.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Commissions in England after 1913 included design challenges not confined to buildings, such as fabrics, furniture, and even bookbindings. Mackintosh died in London in 1928.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After 1904 architectural taste had turned against Mackintosh\'s style; his work was seen as strange. Mackintosh could not conform to the times; he lost commissions, drank heavily, and ended up poor and sick. His reputation revived only in the 1950s with the publication of his monographs.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">How to See His Work</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Glasgow is the best place in the world to admire Mackintosh\'s work: in addition to the buildings mentioned above, most of which can be visited, the Hunterian Art Gallery contains magnificent reconstructions of the principal rooms at 78 Southpark Avenue, Mackintosh\'s Glasgow home, and original drawings, documents, and records, plus the re-creation of a room at 78 Derngate, Northampton. To take it all in, purchase a £12 <b>Mackintosh Trail Ticket</b> at major sites, visitor centers, or online from the Mackintosh Society (www.crmsociety.com).

Eccentric millionaire Sir William Burrell (1861-1958) donated the magpie collection to the city in 1944. The 1983 building\'s exterior and interior were designed with large glass walls so that the items on display could relate to their surroundings in Pollok Country Park: art and nature, supposedly in perfect harmony.

Consecrated in 1136 and completed about 300 years later, it was spared the ravages of the Reformation—which destroyed so many of Scotland\'s medieval churches—mainly because Glasgow\'s trade guilds defended it. A late-medieval open timber roof in the nave and lovely 20th-century stained glass are notable features. In the lower church is the splendid crypt of St. Mungo, who was originally known as St. Kentigern (<i>kentigern</i> means \"chief word,\") but who was nicknamed St. Mungo (meaning \"dear one\") by his early followers in Glasgow. The site of the tomb has been revered since the 6th century, when St. Mungo founded a church here. Mungo features prominently in local legends; one such legend is about a pet bird that he nursed back to life, and another tells of a bush or tree, the branches of which he used to miraculously relight a fire. Bird, tree, and the salmon with a ring in its mouth are all to be found on the city of Glasgow\'s coat of arms, together with a bell that Mungo brought from Rome. www.glasgow-cathedral.com.

The stunning red-sandstone edifice is an appropriate home for works by Botticelli, Rembrandt, Monet, and others; the museum has been hailed as \"one of the greatest civic collections in Europe.\" The Glasgow Room houses extraordinary works by local artists. There\'s also a Mackintosh and the Glasgow Style room, a multimedia object cinema, a picture promenade, and a natural history exhibit on creatures of the past. Whether the subject is Scottish culture, design, or storytelling, every wall and room begs you to look deeper; labels are thought provoking and sometimes witty.

The River Clyde powers its way through a beautiful wooded gorge here, and its waters were harnessed to drive textile-mill machinery before the end of the 18th century. The owner, David Dale (1739-1806), was noted for his caring attitude toward the workers, unusual for that era. Later, his son-in-law, Robert Owen (1771-1858), took this attitude even further, founding a benevolent doctrine known as Owenism and eventually crossing the Atlantic to become involved in a similar planned-community project in Indiana, called New Harmony, which, unlike New Lanark, failed. Robert Owen\'s son Robert Dale Owen (1801-77) helped found the Smithsonian Institution.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After many changes of fortune, the mills eventually closed and were converted into a hotel and private residential properties. As a result, residents have moved in, and New Lanark has maintained its unique environment, where those leading normal everyday lives mix easily with the tourists.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the mills has been converted into a visitor and interpretive center that tells the story of this brave social experiment. You can also explore Robert Owen\'s house, the school, and a mill worker\'s house. Other restored mills hold various shops and eateries; one has a rooftop garden with impressive views of the entire site.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Upstream, the Clyde flows through some of the finest river scenery anywhere in Lowland Scotland, with woods and spectacular waterfalls; the falls are nearby, and it\'s easy to explore these. www.newlanark.org.

Popular stops like <b>Aquarium, Pinnacles,</b> and <b>Grouper Hole</b> have large schools of fish, turtles, nurse sharks, and gray reef sharks. From the south side dive boats go to <b>French Cay, West Caicos, South West Reef,</b> and <b>Northwest Point.</b> Known for typically calm conditions and clear water, the West Caicos Marine National Park is a favorite stop. The area has dramatic walls and marine life, including sharks, eagle rays, and octopus, with large stands of pillar coral and huge barrel sponges.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Off Grand Turk, the 7,000-foot coral wall <b>drop-off</b> is actually within swimming distance of the beach. Buoyed sites along the wall have swim-through tunnels, cascading sand chutes, imposing coral pinnacles, dizzying vertical drops, and undercuts where the wall goes beyond the vertical and fades beneath the reef.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Best Spas in Provo and Beyond</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A Turks Island Salt Glow, where the island\'s seasalt is mixed with gentle oils to exfoliate, smooth, and moisturize the skin, is just one of the treatments you can enjoy in one of the island spas. Being pampered spa-style has become as much a part of a Turks and Caicos vacation as sunning on the beach. Marine-based ingredients fit well with the Grace Bay backdrop at the Thalasso Spa at <b>Point Grace,</b> where massages take place in two simple, bleached-white cottages standing on the dune line, which means you have a spectacular view of the sea-blue hues if you manage to keep your eyes open. The Regent Spa at the <b>Regent Palms</b> offers individual treatments with a water feature by day, a fire feature at night. Their signature body scrub uses hand-crushed local conch shells to smooth the skin. But the widest choice of Asian-inspired treatments (and the most-unforgettable scenery) can be found at the 6,000-square-foot Como Shambhala Spa at the <b>Parrot Cay Resort,</b> which has outdoor whirlpools and a central beech-wood lounge overlooking the shallow turquoise waters and mangroves. Provo also has a noteworthy day spa that\'s not in one of the Grace Bay resorts. Manager Terri Tapper of <b>Spa Tropique</b> (Ports of Call, Grace Bay Rd., Grace Bay. tel. 649/941-5720. www.spatropique.com) blends Swedish, therapeutic, and reflexology massage techniques using oils made from natural plants and products produced locally and within the Caribbean region. The Turks Island Salt Glow has become one of her most popular treatments.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It\'s a 30 minute drive to Guadalajara, but the trip can be delayed in either direction by slow-moving caravans of trucks and weekend traffic. The seven- to eight-hour bus ride between Guadalajara and Mexico City usually costs $40 and is generally efficient and comfortable. Estrella Blanca, ETN, Primera Plus, and Transportes al Pacifico have many daily departures. Toll highway 15D is the safest and quickest route between Mexico City and Guadalajara.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Guadalajara Background</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The conquistadors had a difficult time founding Guadalajara. A decade of Indian uprisings and Spanish crown interference caused the capital of sprawling Nueva Galicia to shift locations three times before it reached its present perch in 1542. According to popular legend, the founding occurred behind downtown\'s Teatro Degollado. (A plaza behind the theater commemorates the event.) Guadalajara\'s name comes from a similarly named Spanish city; the word is Arabic in origin meaning \"river of rocks.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Often cut off from the capital during the rainy season, Guadalajara developed independently, with the Catholic Church as its dominant social and political influence. Miguel Hidalgo\'s final battlefield defeat in the War of Independence from Spain—which eventually ended nearly 300 years of Spanish rule—took place here in 1811. It was briefly the capital of Mexico from 1856 to 1857, during the tumultuous reform period. Later, the city had a tardy start in the Mexican Revolution, taking up arms four years after it began in 1910.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When ultra-right-wing president Plutarco Elías Calles effectively criminalized Catholicism in 1926, Jalisco-area Catholics launched an armed rebellion against the government. During the bitter <i>La Cristiada</i> war, many priests were executed. In recent years dozens of <i>Cristero</i> martyrs have been canonized by the Vatican, a great source of pride for Guadalajara\'s Catholics.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Once notorious as a filthy wet market from which weak-stomached travelers were advised to steer clear, this sprawling maze of shops and stalls has been transformed into a traditional Chinese-medicine market. On the grounds where caged cats, chickens, and turtles once awaited doom, a new mall has risen, one with wide aisles and escalators, and 100 or so stalls of varying sizes filled with merchants dealing in everything from acupuncture needles to zebra testicles.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whether you chose to shop in the new mall or in the surrounding alleyways (still filled with shops of a less gentrified nature, offering both Chinese medicine and livestock), you\'re in for a serious <i>only in China</i> experience. How much are a pair of dried lizards on sticks really worth? How many ounces of dried sea horse are needed to make broth for a family of four?

And then there\'s the meal fit for a king, featuring eight separate courses served in crystal dishes. As the audience eats each dish, their ingredients, health benefits, and historical significance are explained by a Beijing-trained opera singer (who happens to speak a little English as well). Tickets can be booked at the front desk of better hotels, and performances are held nightly, with matinees on Saturday and Sunday.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

(We admit that the majority of international visitors stay in Antigua and make the capital their day trip instead.) The Mayan ruins of Mixco Viejo lie 60 km (36 mi) north of the capital and make an easy, do-it-yourself trip if you have a vehicle. Many operators lead ascents to the Volcán Pacaya south of the city. Although many people do this excursion on their own, we recommend going with an organized tour for safety reasons, both criminal and volcanic.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tourist attractions around the country can be your excursions, thanks to numerous tour operators who offer organized trips. Antigua and Mixco Viejo are among the offerings, as are day trips to Lake Atitlán. Chichicastenango appears on the tour lists on Thursday and Sunday market days. (Most Chichi trips include a stop at the lake.) Operators organize day excursions from the capital farther afield to the Mayan ruins at Copán, Honduras, or to Guatemala\'s very own Tikal in El Petén. Flying is the only way to do Tikal in one day (although it\'s preferable to overnight at the ruins). The flight takes less than one hour, as compared to 10 hours overland.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mixco Viejo</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">North of Guatemala City lie the 12th-century Mayan ruins of <b>Mixco Viejo</b>. The mountaintop site, thought to be largely ceremonial, was one of the last Mayan sites to fall to Pedro de Alvarado and the conquistadors in 1525. Excavation began on the site\'s 120 structures in 1954.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Temples and palaces make up Mixco Viejo, but most notably, it contains several ball courts used in the Mayan ballgame of <i>pitziil</i>, a game with many variations seen throughout pre-Columbian indigenous civilizations. (Historians today group the games under the general heading <i>ulama</i>, a Nahuatl word meaning simply \"ballgame.\") Objectively, it resembled a mix of soccer and volleyball, but for the Maya, pitziil transcended mere sport, providing a cosmic link between mortals and gods, between past and future.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mixco Viejo is no Tikal or Quiriguá, but it\'s a favored destination for weekend visitors from the capital who come for the splendid views of the surrounding countryside.

From 300 BC to AD 900, an early Mayan city of some 50,000 people flourished in what is now the heart of Zona 7 in one of Guatemala City\'s many gorges. What you can see today, about 100 mounds and platforms, is but a fraction of the original city, most of which is buried beneath today\'s urban sprawl. Excavation of this impressive site, which includes the bases of several pyramids, began in 1925, triggered by the simple act of a local soccer team digging into the ground to expand its practice field. Many of the figurines and artifacts originally unearthed were thought to be associated with burial, leading authorities to dub the site with its present name, a Quiché term meaning \"hills of the dead.\" No one knows for sure what the city was originally called. Many of the objects found here are now on display at the Museo Popol Vuh.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Bit of History</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Guatemala City exists only because of the 1773 earthquake that leveled nearby Antigua. Authorities decided once and for all to move their capital to supposedly safer ground after several such seismic events during colonial times. The new city broke ground three years later with the stately name <i>La Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción.</i> (\"The New Guatemala of the Assumption\"), presiding over Spain\'s colony of Central America for nearly a half-century more before becoming the capital of an independent Guatemala.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The land wasn\'t empty pre-1776, however. The Maya had lived here for 2,500 years before the relocation of the colonial capital, as evidenced by the ruins of Kaminaljuyú, today nearly swallowed up by modern development in Zona 7. True to historical patterns in developing countries, waves of migration from poor rural areas have caused the capital to balloon in size, including those who fled to the capital during Guatemala\'s long civil war, looking for safety when violence shook the highlands. Many shantytowns ring the city as a result.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">That much-vaunted safety from seismic activity that led colonial authorities to set up shop here proved an illusion: three major earthquakes rocked Guatemala City in the 20th century, the most devastating taking place in February 1976 killing 23,000 people. Small tremors remain a fact of life in the capital. With the government struggling to upgrade building codes, it is hoped that the next \"big one\" will cause less damage.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Head for Peggy\'s Cove, a fishing village perched on sea-washed granite and surrounded by coastal barrens. Explore the crafts shops of Mahone Bay and travel on to Lunenburg and the Fisheries Museum. Continue on Highway 3 or 103 to Shelburne on Day 2. Visit Yarmouth and travel on to Digby to try its famous scallops. Annapolis Royal is a lovely spot to spend an afternoon, or drive down Digby Neck to visit Long Island and Brier Island and catch a whale-watching cruise in season. Travel on to the elm-lined streets of Wolfville, home of Acadia University, and explore nearby Grand Pré National Historic Site. On Day 3, check tide times and drive to Minas Basin, where the tides are the highest in the world. A leisurely drive puts you back in Halifax by late afternoon.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If you have 5 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend a day or two in Halifax before exploring the Eastern Shore along Highway 7, which winds along a dramatic coastline. Musquodoboit Harbour is a haven for fishing enthusiasts. Nearby is Martinique Beach, one of Nova Scotia\'s best. Spend some time in Sherbrooke Village. Continue on Highway 7 toward Antigonish on the Sunrise Trail. Visit Hector Heritage Quay in Pictou, where the Scots landed in 1773. From Pictou, Highway 6 runs beside a string of beaches. Turn right to Malagash and Jost Vineyards. A half-hour drive takes you to Amherst. Continue on to Joggins and search for souvenirs in its sandstone cliffs. For more fossils, head to Parrsboro.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If you have 7 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cape Breton Island is the perfect place for a leisurely 7-day tour. The coastal route takes you on a west-to-east loop from the Canso Strait Causeway. Overnight in Mabou, the heart of the island\'s rich musical tradition. From a base in Margaree Harbour, take a day or more to explore the Cabot Trail and Cape Breton Highlands National Park. Peruse crafts stores along St. Ann\'s Bay, but allow time to visit the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site in Baddeck. Spend the night in Iona. A day or two in Sydney positions you for an afternoon excursion to the Cape Breton Miners\' Museum in Glace Bay and a daylong visit to Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Park and the town of Louisbourg. Take Highway 4 back to Canso Causeway through Big Pond, and spend a day wandering the colorful Acadian villages of Isle Madame, such as Arichat.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">An alternative 7-day tour, could be paring Cape Breton down to 2 or 3 days—a day in Louisbourg, one on the Cabot Trail, and one in Baddeck, for example—and combining this with a visit to the eastern shore/Sherbrooke and the Antigonish route.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nova Scotia Festivals</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nova Scotia is full of festivals. To celebrate the harvest there\'s the Apple Blossom Festival in Wolfville in May, celebrations run straight through delicacies and the season: June and July bring lobster festivals in Shelburne and Pictou, respectively, and a Seafest in Yarmouth in July celebrates all the fruits of the sea. August sees the blueberry festival in Oxford and scallop days in Digby.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are also events all over the province highlighting the province\'s diversity of cultures: in June there\'s a three-day Greek fest in Halifax and a weekend-long multicultural festival on the Dartmouth waterfront. July has a celebration of all things Scottish at the Antigonish Highland Games. There\'s a two-week Acadian festival in Clare in August.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The sea inspires festivals like the Wooden Boat Festival in Mahone Bay in August; sailing race weeks are held every summer in Chester and Baddeck.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For music and arts lovers, Halifax hosts the Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo (a military pageantry) in June, an Atlantic Jazz Fest in July, and a busker (street performers) festival in August. September brings a fringe theater festival and the Atlantic Film Fest while only Cape Breton can lay claim to the Celtic Colours International Festival every October.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Constructed between 1649 and 1661 (the tower followed in 1669), it was razed after lightning struck almost a century later. It was rebuilt between 1750 and 1786 in the decorative Nordic baroque style, but was gutted by a terrible fire in 1906. The replica, completed in 1912, was demolished during World War II. The present church is a reconstruction.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The distinctive 433-foot brick-and-iron tower bears the largest tower clock in Germany, 26 feet in diameter. Just above the clock is a viewing platform (accessible by elevator or stairs) that affords a magnificent panorama of the city, the Elbe River, and the Alster Lakes. Twice a day, at 10 AM and 9 PM (Sunday at noon), a watchman plays a trumpet solo from the tower platform, and during festivals an entire wind ensemble crowds onto the platform to perform.

One of these was freedom from paying duties on goods transported on the Elbe River. The original Free Port was where the Alster meets the Elbe, near Deichstrasse, but it was moved farther south as Hamburg\'s trade expanded. When Hamburg joined the German Empire\'s Customs Union in the late 1800s, the Free Port underwent major restructuring to make way for additional storage facilities. An entire residential area was torn down (including many Renaissance and baroque buildings), and the <b>Speicherstadt</b> warehouses, the world\'s largest block of continuous storage space, came into being between 1885 and 1927. U-bahn:St. Pauli Landungsbrücken (U-bahn). </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rathaus</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To most Hamburgers this large building is the symbolic heart of the city. As a city-state—an independent city and simultaneously one of the 16 federal states of Germany—Hamburg has a city council and a state government, both of which have their administrative headquarters in the Rathaus. A pompous neo-Renaissance affair, the building dictates political decorum in the city. To this day, the mayor of Hamburg never welcomes VIPs at the foot of its staircase, but always awaits them at the very top—whether it\'s a president or the queen of England.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Both the Rathaus and the <b>Rathausmarkt</b> (Town Hall Market) lie on marshy land, a fact vividly brought to mind in 1962, when the entire area was severely flooded. The large square, with its surrounding arcades, was laid out after Hamburg\'s Great Fire of 1842. The architects set out to create a square with the grandeur of Venice\'s Piazza San Marco. The Rathaus was begun in 1866, when 4,000 piles were sunk into the moist soil to support the structure. It was completed in 1892, the year a cholera epidemic claimed the lives of 8,605 people in 71 days. A fountain and monument to that unhappy chapter in Hamburg\'s history are in a rear courtyard of the Rathaus.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The immense building, with its 647 rooms (6 more than Buckingham Palace) and imposing central clock tower, is not the most graceful structure in the city, but the sheer opulence of its interior is astonishing. A 45-minute tour begins in the ground-floor Rathausdiele, a vast pillared hall. Although you can only view the state rooms, their tapestries, huge staircases, glittering chandeliers, coffered ceilings, and grand portraits give you a sense of the city\'s great wealth in the 19th century and its understandable civic pride. www.hamburg.de.

It was nicknamed \"The Devil\'s Islands\" by early sea travelers, frightened by the calls of cahow birds and the squeals of wild pigs that could be heard on shore. But perhaps the most damning tales were told by sailors terrified of being wrecked on Bermuda\'s dangerous reefs. The island\'s mystical reputation is believed to have inspired Shakespeare\'s <i>The Tempest,</i> a tale of shipwreck and sorcery in \"the still-vexed Bermoothes.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The early origin of the Triangle myth stretches as far back as Columbus, who noted in his logbook a haywire compass, strange lights, and a burst of flame falling into the sea. Columbus, as well as other seamen after him, also encountered a harrowing stretch of ocean now known as the Sargasso Sea. Ancient tales tell of sailboats stranded forever in a windless expanse of water, surrounded by seaweed and the remnants of other unfortunate vessels. It\'s true that relics have been found in the Sargasso Sea—an area of ocean between Bermuda and the Caribbean—but the deadly calm waters are more likely the result of circular ocean currents sweeping through the North Atlantic rather than paranormal activity.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the past 500 years at least 50 ships and 20 aircraft have vanished in the Triangle, most without a trace—no wreckage, no bodies, nothing. Many disappeared in reportedly calm waters, without having sent a distress signal. Among the legends is that of Flight 19. At 2:10 on the afternoon of December 5, 1945, five TBM Avenger Torpedo Bombers took off from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on a routine two-hour training mission. Their last radio contact was at 4 PM. The planes and 27 men were never seen or heard from again. The official navy report said the planes disappeared \"as if they had flown to Mars.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The bizarre disappearances attributed to the Triangle have been linked to everything from alien abduction to sorcery. Although the mystery has not been completely solved, there are scientific explanations for many of the maritime disasters that have occurred in the Triangle. The most obvious answers are linked to extreme weather conditions with which any Bermudian fisherman would be well acquainted. \"White squalls\"—intense, unexpected storms that arrive without warning on otherwise clear days—are probable culprits, along with waterspouts, the equivalent of sea tornadoes. The most recent scientific theory on the infamous Triangle suggests that the freakish disappearance of ships and aircraft could be the result of large deposits of methane gas spewing up from the ocean floor. Huge eruptions of methane bubbles may push water away from a ship, causing it to sink. If the highly flammable methane then rises into the air, it could ignite in an airplane\'s engine—causing it to explode and disappear.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fact or fiction, the Triangle is a part of local lore that won\'t disappear anytime soon. But don\'t let it scare you away—this myth isn\'t the only thing that makes Bermuda seem so magical.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">—Kim Dismont Robinson</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It was not, however, the first house of worship to stand on this site. It replaced a 1612 structure made of wooden posts and palmetto leaves that was destroyed in a storm. The present church was extended in 1713 (the oldest part is the area around the triple-tier pulpit), with the tower and wings being added in the 19th century. Befitting its age, St. Peter\'s has many treasures. The red cedar altar, carved in 1615 under the supervision of Richard Moore (a shipwright and the colony\'s first governor) is the oldest piece of woodwork in Bermuda. The late 18th-century bishop\'s throne is believed to have been salvaged from a shipwreck, and the baptismal font, brought to the island by early settlers, is an estimated 900 years old. There\'s also a fine collection of communion silver from the 1600s in the vestry. Nevertheless, it\'s the building itself that leaves the most lasting impression. With rough-hewn pillars, exposed cedar beams, and candlelit chandeliers, the church is stunning in its simplicity. After viewing the interior, walk into the churchyard to see where prominent Bermudians, including Governor Sir Richard Sharples who was assassinated in 1973, are buried. A separate graveyard for slaves and free blacks (to the west of the church, behind the wall) is a poignant reminder of Bermuda\'s segregated past. www.anglican.bm. COST: Donations accepted.

Insulated from the rest of the Dockyard by a moat and massive stone ramparts, it is entered by way of a drawbridge. At the Shifting House, right inside the entrance, you can wander through rooms filled with relics from some of the 350-odd ships wrecked on the island\'s reefs. Other buildings are devoted to seafaring pursuits such as whaling, shipbuilding, and yacht racing. More displays are in the 19th-century Commissioner\'s House, on the museum\'s upper grounds. Built as both home and headquarters for the Dockyard commissioner, the house later served as a barracks during World War I and was used for military intelligence during World War II. Today, after an award-winning restoration, it contains exhibits on Bermuda\'s social and military history. Before seeing them, you\'ll likely want to snap some photos of the goats that graze outside the building: their job is to keep the grass well mowed.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After immersing yourself in maritime history, you can immerse yourself—literally—in the wonderful world of dolphins. <b>Dolphin Quest</b> (tel. 441/234-4464. www.dolphinquest.org) offers a range of in-water programs that allow adults and children ages five or older to pet, play with, and swim alongside Atlantic bottlenose dolphins in the historic Keep Pond. There are even specially designed sessions, conducted from a submersible bench, for younger kids. Since entry to the Dolphin Quest area is free with museum admission, anyone can watch the action.

But following an ambitious decade-long expansion program, it rates as one of Bermuda\'s premier attractions. In the aquarium the big draw is the North Rock Exhibit, a 140,000-gallon tank that gives you a diver\'s-eye view of the area\'s living coral reefs and the colorful marine life it sustains. The museum section has multimedia and interactive displays focusing on native habitats and the impact humans have had on them. The island-theme zoo, meanwhile, displays more than 300 birds, reptiles, and mammals. Don\'t miss the \"Islands of Australasia\" exhibit with its lemurs, wallabies, and tree kangaroos or \"Islands of the Caribbean,\" a huge walk-through enclosure that gets you within arms-length of ibises and golden lion tamarins. Other popular areas include an outdoor seal pool, tidal touch tank, and cool kid-friendly Discovery Room. www.bamz.org. COST: $10.

With clear water, a.3-mi crescent of pink sand, a vibrant social scene, and the uncluttered backdrop of South Shore Park, Horseshoe Bay has everything you could ask of a Bermudian beach. A snack bar, changing rooms, beach-rental facilities, and lifeguards add to its appeal. Outdoor concerts, events, crab racing, and the Good Friday Annual Kite Competition take place in the high and shoulder seasons. The undertow can be strong, especially on the main beach. A better place for children is <b>Horseshoe Baby Beach.</b> Before 2003\'s Hurricane Fabian, this beach was reached by climbing a trail over the dunes at the western end of Horseshoe Bay. Fabian\'s storm surge ploughed right through those dunes, creating a wide walkway for eager little beachgoers. Sheltered from the ocean by a ring of rocks, this cove is shallow and almost perfectly calm. In summer, toddlers can find lots of playmates. <b>Pros:</b> adjoining beach is perfect for small children, snack bar with outdoor and indoor seating. <b>Cons:</b> the bus stop is a long walk up a huge hill, gets very crowded, busiest beach on the island. Metro: Bus 7 from Hamilton. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Crystal Caves</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bermuda\'s limestone caves have been attracting attention since the island was first settled. As far back as 1623, Captain John Smith (of Pocahontas fame) commented on these \"vary strange, darke, and cumbersome\" caverns. Nevertheless, it came as a surprise when two boys, attempting to retrieve a lost ball, discovered Crystal Cave in 1907. The hole through which the boys descended is still visible. But, thankfully, you can now view their find without having to make such a dramatic entrance. Inside, tour guides will lead you across a pontoon bridge that spans a 55-foot-deep subterranean lake. Look up to see stalactites dripping from the ceiling or down through the perfectly clear water to see stalagmites rising from the cave floor. Amateur spelunkers can also journey through geologic time at Crystal\'s smaller sister cave, Fantasy. After being closed to the public for decades, it reopened in 2001. Set aside 30 minutes to see one cave; 75 minutes if you plan to take in both. www.bermudacaves.com. COST: One cave $18; combination ticket $26.

Every year at this time, crowds gather at a safe distance to watch what begins as a distant line of white waves approaching. As it nears, it becomes a towering, thundering wall of water.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The phenomenon, known as a tidal bore occurs when strong tides surge against the current of the river. The Qiantang Tidal Bore is the largest in the world, with speeds recorded up to 25 mi an hour, and heights of 30 feet. The Qiantang has the best conditions in the world to produce these tidal waves. Incoming tides are funneled into the shallow riverbed from the Gulf of Hangzhou. The bell shape narrows and concentrates the wave.

There\'s a fabulous boardwalk with weeping willows, restaurants, and a lakeside teahouse.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Wending north, you can cross the street to ascend a small hill capped with the Baochu Pagoda.

And as one of China\'s first Special Economic Zones, Xiamen is currently awash with cash but still hasn\'t lost its old-world charm. Fall and spring are the ideal times to visit the region. Spring, especially April and May, have very comfortable temperatures and the trees and flowers are in full bloom. Hot and muggy summer is not the best time to visit—many of the cities are uncomfortable from mid-June though August. The region has a long and very pleasant fall season—moderate weather and clear skies lasting into early December. Chinese tourists flood in during the two \"Golden Week\" holidays at the start of May and October, so try to avoid those two weeks.

The pagoda collapsed in 1924, perhaps finally freeing the White Snake. A new tower, completed in 2002, sits beside the remains of its predecessor. There\'s a sculpture on each level, including a carving that depicts the tragic story of the White Snake.

Larger hotels offer a private sauna in the higher-class rooms and suites. Public saunas (with swimsuits required) are becoming increasingly popular, even in winter, when sauna-goers momentarily leave the sauna to jump into the sea through a large hole in the ice (called <i>avantouinti</i>).

Although Suomenlinna has never been taken by assault, its occupants surrendered once to the Russians in 1808 and came under fire from British ships in 1855 during the Crimean War. Today Suomenlinna makes a lovely excursion from Helsinki, particularly in early summer when the island is engulfed in a mauve-and-purple mist of lilacs, introduced from Versailles by the Finnish architect Ehrensvärd.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Suomenlinna is easily reached by public ferry (EUR 2.20 one-way, EUR 3.50 round-trip) or private boat (EUR 3.50 one-way, EUR 5.50 round-trip), both of which leave from Helsinki\'s Kauppatori.

At 597 square mi Oahu is the third largest island in the chain; the majority of residents live in or around Honolulu, so the rest of the island still fits neatly into the tropical, untouched vision of Hawaii. Situated southeast of Kauai and northwest of Maui, Oahu is a central location for island hopping. Surfing contests on the legendary North Shore, Pearl Harbor, and iconic Waikiki Beach are all here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Maui.</b> The second largest island in the chain, Maui\'s 729 square mi are home to only 119,000 people but host approximately 2.5 million tourists every year. Maui is northwest of the Big Island, and close enough to be visible from its beaches on a clear day. With its restaurants and lively nightlife, Maui is the only island that competes with Oahu in terms of entertainment; its charm lies in the fact that although entertainment is available, Maui\'s towns still feel like island villages compared to the heaving modern city of Honolulu.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Hawaii (The Big Island)</b>. The Big Island has the second largest population of the islands (167,000) but feels sparsely settled due to its size. It\'s 4,038 square mi and growing—all of the other islands could fit onto the Big Island and there would still be room left over. The southernmost island in the chain (slightly southeast of Maui), the Big Island is home to Kilauea, the most active volcano on the planet. It percolates within Volcanoes National Park, which draws 2.5 million visitors every year.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Kauai.</b> The northernmost island in the chain (northwest of Oahu), Kauai is, at approximately 540 square mi, the fourth largest of all the islands and the least populated of the larger islands, with just under 63,000 residents. Known as the Garden Isle, Kauai claims the title \"wettest spot on Earth\" with an annual average rainfall of 460 inches. Kauai is a favorite with honeymooners and others wanting to get away from it all—lush and peaceful, it\'s the perfect escape from the modern world.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Molokai.</b> North of Lanai and Maui, and east of Oahu, Molokai is Hawaii\'s fifth largest island, encompassing 260 square mi. On a clear night, the lights of Honolulu are visible from Molokai\'s western shore. Molokai is sparsely populated, with just under 7,400 residents, the majority of whom are native Hawaiians. Most of Molokai\'s 85,000 annual visitors travel from Maui or Oahu to spend the day exploring its beaches, cliffs, and former leper colony on Kalaupapa Peninsula.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Lanai.</b> Lying just off Maui\'s western coast, Lanai looks nothing like its sister islands, with pine trees and deserts in place of palm trees and beaches. Still, the tiny 140-square-mi island is home to nearly 3,000 residents and draws an average of 90,000 visitors each year to two resorts (one in the mountains and one at the shore), both operated by Four Seasons.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Geology</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Hawaiian Islands comprise more than just the islands inhabited and visited by humans. A total of 19 islands and atolls constitutes the State of Hawaii, with a total landmass of 6,423.4 square mi. The Islands are actually exposed peaks of a submersed mountain range called the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain. The range was formed as the Pacific plate moved very slowly (around 32 mi every million years) over a \"hot spot\" in the Earth\'s mantle. Because the plate moved northwestwardly, the Islands in the northwest portion of the archipelago (chain) are older, which is also why they\'re smaller—they have been eroding longer.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Big Island is the youngest, and thus the largest, island in the chain. It is built from seven different volcanoes, including Mauna Loa, which is the largest shield volcano on the planet. Mauna Loa and Kilauea are the only Hawaiian volcanoes still erupting with any sort of frequency. Mauna Loa last erupted in 1984. Kilauea has been continuously erupting since 1983. Mauna Kea (Big Island), Hualalai (Big Island), and Haleakala (Maui) are all in what\'s called the Post Shield stage of volcanic development—eruptions decrease steadily for up to 250,000 years before ceasing entirely. Kohala (Big Island), Lanai (Lanai), and Waianae (Oahu) are considered extinct volcanoes, in the erosional stage of development; Koolau (Oahu) and West Maui (Maui) volcanoes are extinct volcanoes in the rejuvenation stage—after lying dormant for hundreds of thousands of years, they began erupting again, but only once every several thousand years.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There is currently an active undersea volcano called Loihi that has been erupting regularly. If it continues its current pattern, it should breach the ocean\'s surface in tens of thousands of years.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Flora &amp; Fauna</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though much of the plant life associated with Hawaii today (pineapple, hibiscus, orchid, plumeria) was brought by Tahitian, Samoan, or European visitors, Hawaii is also home to several endemic species, like the koa tree and the yellow hibiscus. Long-dormant volcanic craters are perfect hiding places for rare plants (like the silversword, a rare cousin of the sunflower, which grows on Hawaii\'s three tallest peaks: Haleakala, Mauna Kea, and Mauna Loa, and nowhere else on Earth). Many of these endemic species are now threatened by the encroachment of introduced plants and animals. Hawaii is also home to a handful of plants that have evolved into uniquely Hawaiian versions of their original selves. Mint, for example, develops its unique taste to keep would-be predators from eating its leaves. As there were no such predators in Hawaii for hundreds of years, a mintless mint evolved; similar stories exist for the Islands\' nettle-less nettles, thorn-less briars.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hawaii\'s climate is well suited to growing several types of flowers, most of which are introduced species. Plumeria creeps over all of the Islands; orchids run rampant on the Big Island; bright orange ilima light up the mountains of Oahu. These flowers give the Hawaiian lei their color and fragrance.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As with the plant life, the majority of the animals in Hawaii today were brought here by visitors. Axis deer from India roam the mountains of Lanai. The Islands are home to dozens of rat species, all stowaways on long boat rides over from Tahiti, England, and Samoa; the mongoose was brought to keep the rats out of the sugar plantations—a failed effort as the mongoose hunts by day, the rat by night. Many of Hawaii\'s birds, like the nene (Hawaii\'s state bird) and the pueo (Hawaiian owl) are endemic; unfortunately, about 80% are also endangered.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The ocean surrounding the Islands teems with animal life. Once scarce manta rays have made their way back to the Big Island; spinner dolphins and sea turtles can be found off the coast of all the Islands; and every year from December to May, the humpback whales migrate past Hawaii in droves.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">History</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Long before both Christopher Columbus and the Vikings, Polynesian seafarers set out to explore the vast stretches of open ocean in double-hulled canoes. Now regarded as some of the world\'s greatest navigators, the ancestors of the Hawaiian people sailed across the Pacific Ocean using the stars, birds, and sea life as their guides. From Western Polynesia they traveled back and forth between Samoa, Fiji, Tahiti, the Marquesas, and the Society Isles, settling the outer reaches of the Pacific, Hawaii, and Easter Island, as early as AD 300. The golden era of Polynesian voyaging peaked around AD 1200, after which the distant Hawaiian Islands were left to develop their own unique cultural practices in relative isolation.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When the British explorer Captain James Cook arrived in 1778, he found a deeply religious, agrarian society governed by numerous alii, or chiefs. Revered as a god upon his arrival, Cook was later killed in a skirmish over a stolen boat. With guns and ammunition purchased from Cook, the Big Island chief, Kamehameha, gained a significant advantage over the other Hawaiian alii. He united Hawaii into one kingdom in 1810, bringing an end to the frequent interisland battles that had previously dominated Hawaiian life. Tragically, the new kingdom was beset with troubles. Their religion was abandoned. European explorers brought foreign diseases with them; within a few short years the Hawaiian population was cut in half. It was further weakened by the onset of the sandalwood trade in the mid-1800s. All able-bodied men were sent into the forest to harvest the fragrant tree, so that Kamehameha\'s successor, Liholiho could pay off debts incurred to American merchants. Onto this stage came rowdy foreign whalers, ambitious entrepreneurs, and well-intentioned but perhaps misguided missionaries. New laws regarding land ownership and religious practices eroded the cultural underpinnings of pre-contact Hawaii. Each successor to the Hawaiian throne sacrificed more control over the island kingdom. Finally in 1893, the last Hawaiian monarch, Queen Liliuokalani, was overthrown by a group of American and European businessmen and government officials, aided by an armed militia. This led to the creation of the Republic of Hawaii, which quickly became a territory of the United States through resolutions passed by Congress (rather than through treaties). Hawaii remained a territory for 60 years; Pearl Harbor was attacked as part of the United States in 1941 during World War II. It wasn\'t until 1959, however, that Hawaii was officially admitted as the 50th State.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Legends &amp; Mythology</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ancient deities play a huge role in Hawaiian life today—not just in daily rituals, but in the Hawaiians\' reverence for their land. Gods and goddesses tend to be associated with particular parts of the land, and most of them are connected with many places thanks to the body of stories built up around each.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The goddess Pele lives in Kilauea Volcano and rules over the Big Island. She is a feisty goddess known for turning enemies into trees or destroying the homes of adversaries with fire. She also has a penchant for gin, which is why you\'ll see gin bottles circling some of the craters at Volcanoes National Park. It\'s not the litter it appears to be, but rather an offering to placate the Volcano goddess. The Valley Isle\'s namesake, the demigod Maui, is a well-known Polynesian trickster. When his mother Hina complained that there were too few hours in the day, Maui promised to slow the sun. Upon hearing this, the god Moemoe teased Maui for boasting, but undeterred, the demigod wove a strong cord and lassoed the sun. Angry, the sun scorched the fields until an agreement was reached: during summer, the sun would travel more slowly. In winter, it would return to its quick pace. For ridiculing Maui, Moemoe was turned into a large rock that still juts from the water near Kahakualoa.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the most important ways the ancient Hawaiians showed respect for their gods and goddesses was through the hula. Various forms of the hula were performed as prayers to the gods and as praise to the chiefs. Performances were taken very seriously, as a mistake was thought to invalidate the prayer, or even to offend the god or chief in question. Hula is still performed both as entertainment and as prayer.; it is not uncommon for a hula performance to be included in an official government ceremony.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hawaii Today</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After a long period of suppression, Hawaiian culture and traditions have experienced a renaissance over the last few decades. There is a real effort to revive traditions and to respect history as the Islands go through major changes and welcome more and more newcomers every day. New developments often have a Hawaiian cultural expert on staff to ensure cultural sensitivity and to educate newcomers.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nonetheless, development remains a huge issue for all Islanders—land prices are skyrocketing, putting many areas out of reach for the native population. Traffic is becoming a problem on roads that were not designed to accommodate all the new drivers, and the Islands\' limited natural resources are being seriously tapped. The government, though sluggish to respond at first, is trying to make development in Hawaii as sustainable as possible. Rules for new developments protect natural as well as cultural resources, and local governments have set ambitious conservation goals (Honolulu\'s mayor is actively pursuing mass transit and light rail options for the city\'s commuters). Despite all efforts to ease its effect on the land and its people, large-scale, rapid development is not anyone\'s ideal, and Islanders are understandably less than thrilled with the prospect of a million more tourists visiting every year or buying up property that residents themselves can\'t afford.</div><div  class=\"WorldGuide\">That said, the aloha spirit is alive and well. Though you may encounter the occasional \"haole hater\" (haole—pronounced \"howlie\"—is a somewhat pejorative term for caucasians), the majority of Islanders are warm, a welcoming people who are eager to share their culture with those who respect it.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Dramatic cliffs surround crystal clear, turquoise water chock-full of stunning coral and tropical fish. Before the arrival of Captain Cook in the late 18th century, this now tranquil state marine park and sanctuary lay at the center of Hawaiian life. Historians consider Kealakekua Bay to be the birthplace of the post-contact era.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The term \"beach\" is used a bit liberally for <b>Napoopoo Beach,</b> on the south side of the bay. There\'s no real beach to speak of, but there are easy ways to enter the water. To the left of the parking lot is an old cement pier that serves as a great ladder for swimmers going into or coming out of the bay. This is a nice place to swim as it\'s well protected from weather or currents, so the water is almost always calm and clear. Excellent snorkel cruises can still be booked through Fair Wind Cruises, the only company allowed to dock in Kealakekua. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kaunaoa Beach</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hands-down one of the most beautiful beaches on the island, Kaunaoa is a long white crescent of sand. The beach, which fronts the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, slopes very gradually. It\'s a great place for snorkeling. When conditions permit, there is good body- and board surfing also. Currents can be strong, and powerful winter waves can be dangerous, so be careful. At this writing, the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel was closed for repairs to damages sustained in the 2006 earthquake, but the hotel\'s outdoor Hau Tree gazebo bar and restrooms are still open to beachgoers. While the hotel undergoes renovation, there are more public parking spots than usual, but when it reopens public spots will again be limited to only 30, in which case it\'s best to arrive before 10 AM. If the lot is full, head to nearby Hapuna Beach, where a huge parking lot is never full, and try this spot again a different morning. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hapuna Beach State Recreation Area</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">By any measurement, this is one fine beach. Guidebooks usually say it\'s a toss-up between Hapuna and Kaunaoa for \"best beach\" on the island, but most locals give the prize to Hapuna. There is ample parking so you don\'t have to get here at dawn, although the lot can fill up by midday. And while the north end of the beach fronts the Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel, rest assured that this is a public beach. The beach itself is a long (½-mi), white, perfect crescent, one of the Big Island\'s largest. The turquoise water is very calm in summer, with just enough rolling waves to make bodysurfing or boogie boarding fun. There\'s some excellent snorkeling around the jagged rocks that border the beach on either side, but a strong current means it\'s only for experienced swimmers. In winter, surf can be very rough. Hapuna tends to get a little windy in the late afternoon; even that can have a benefit, as everyone else leaves just in time to give you a private, perfect sunset. There are a couple of small protected coves at the north end of the beach with shallow, sandy-bottomed pools ideal for youngsters. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Not a single nail was used to build this nunnery, which dates from 1934. Instead, traditional Tang Dynasty architectural techniques involving wooden dowels and bracket-work hold its 228,000 pieces of timber together. Feng Shui principles governed construction, and polished wood and gleaming Buddha statues are the only adornments.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Hong Kong Disneyland</b>. It\'s as gleaming and polished as all the other Disneys, and it has one big advantage: short lines. You can go on every ride at least once and see all the attractions in a day. If your kids are theme park-savvy, the incredibly tame rides here won\'t win their respect. That said, there are loads for little kids. Space Mountain is the only attraction with a height restriction, so there\'s no ride-exclusion angst for them.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Hong Kong Heritage Museum</b>. There\'s lots of ground to cover at Hong Kong\'s largest: prioritize the New Territories Heritage with its history exhibits; the T. T. Tsui Gallery with its antique Chinese glass, ceramics, and bronzes; and the Cantonese Opera Halls with its costumes and demonstrations.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Lan Kwai Fong</b>. The infamous Lan Kwai Fong, a hillside section around Central\'s D\'Aguilar Street in Central, has many good bistros and a large selection of bars. Along with the drink-swinging hordes, busloads of Japanese and Mainland Chinese tourist offload here on their tour—not to enjoy a beverage, but only to have their picture taken underneath the Lan Kwai Fong\" street sign.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Ocean Park</b>. This marine-theme park embraces both and high- and low-octane buzzes and spectacular zoological attractions; they even breed endangered species here. And there\'s an educational twist to many of the attractions. The park stretches out over 170 hilly acres, and you can gaze down at much of it from spookily silent cabins of the mile-long cable car that connects the tamer Lowlands area to the action-packed Headland.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Sam Tung Uk Museum</b>. A walled Hakka village from 1786 was saved from demolition to create this museum. It\'s in the middle of industrial Tsuen Wan, in the western New Territories, so its quiet whitewashed courtyards and small interlocking chambers contrast greatly with the nearby residential towers.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Stanley Village Market</b>. Although Hong Kong\'s most famed bargain trove no long has the best prices around, combing through the stalls still leads to deals on sportswear, casual clothing, and linens. Dozens and dozens of shops line a main street so narrow that awnings from each side meet in the middle, and on busy days your elbows will come in handy. Weekdays are a little more relaxed.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Star Ferry.</b> Since 1898 the ferry pier has been the gateway to the island for people from Kowloon. If it\'s your first time in the city, you\'re all but required to cross the harbor and back on the beloved green-and-white Star Ferry at least once. It\'s a beautiful, relaxing trip on antiquated, characterful vessels. An evening ride is even better, when the city\'s neon and skyscrapers light up the sky.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas</b>. You climb some 400 steps to reach this temple: but look on the bright side, for each step you get about 32 Buddhas. The uphill path through dense vegetation is lined with life-size golden Buddhas in all kinds of positions. Prepare to be dazzled inside the main temple: its walls are stacked with gilded ceramic statuettes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Tian Tan Buddha</b>. The Tian Tan Buddha is the world\'s largest Buddha—that\'s seated, located outdoors, and made of bronze. It doesn\'t need the epithets: its vast silhouette against the sky is impressive. Steep stairs lead to the lower podium, essentially forcing you to stare up at all 242½ tons of Buddha as you ascend. At the top, cool breezes and fantastic views over Lantau Island await.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Victoria Peak</b>. Its Chinese name, Tai Ping Shan, means Mountain of Great Peace, and the viewing point atop Hong Kong\'s highest hill certainly inspires hushed awe. Spread below you is a glittering forest of skyscrapers; beyond them the harbor and—on a clear day—Kowloon\'s eight mountains. The Peak Tram is the world\'s steepest funicular railway. Before it opened in 1880 the only way to get up was to walk or take a bumpy ride in a sedan chair up steep steps. Grab a seat on the right-hand side for the best views.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Top Reasons to Go</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Harbor Views</b>. The skyline that launched a thousand postcards…see it from Victoria Peak on Hong Kong Island, from the Star Ferry in the harbor, or from the Tsim Sha Tsui promenade in Kowloon.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Cultural Immersion</b>. Start at the Hong Kong Heritage Museum, which chronicles the city\'s history, from village life to booming new towns. A Chinese art collection and an interactive Cantonese opera exhibit are two more reasons to come here before experiencing the many other cultural sights.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Shopping Immersion</b>. Shopping is a religion here. Antiques fill windows along Hollywood Road, from Central to Sheung Wan, where herbalists peddle exotic remedies. Designers monopolize Central\'s malls. At Kowloon\'s street markets, clothes, electronics, and ticky-tack compete for space with food carts.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Horsing Around</b>. Hong Kongers gamble over US$10 billion annually, and the Happy Valley Racetrack is one of their favorite places to do it. The thousands of screaming punters are as much of a spectacle as the races.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Dim Sum</b>. As you bite into a moist siu mai, it dawns on you why everyone says you haven\'t done dim sum until you\'ve done it in Hong Kong. Fresh, innovative ingredients and devout diners make dim sum places here very different from those in Chinatowns worldwide.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The Trails</b>. Well-maintained trails crisscross Hong Kong\'s greenery. You can visit the best wilderness areas simply by tackling part of the MacLehose Trail in Sai Kung Country Park. Crossing the Dragon\'s Back—a Hong Kong Island ridge—leads to unrivaled Southside sea views.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The collections here contain a heady mix of things that make Hong Kong what it is: Ming ceramics, 2,000-year-old calligraphic scrolls, 1,100 works chronicling colonization, kooky contemporary canvases. Thankfully it\'s organized into thematic galleries with clear, if uninspiring, explanations. Hong Kong\'s biggest visiting exhibitions are usually held here too. The museum is a few minutes\' walk from either the Star Ferry or Tsim Sha Tsui MTR stop.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Chinese Antiquities Gallery is the place to head if Ming\'s your thing. A series of low-lit rooms on the third floor houses ceramics from Neolithic times through the Qing dynasty. Unusually, they\'re displayed by motif rather than by period: dragons, phoenixes, lotus flowers, and bats are some of the auspicious designs. Bronzes, jade, lacquerware, textiles, enamel, and glassware complete this collection of decorative art.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the Chinese Fine Art Gallery you get a great introduction to Chinese brush painting, often difficult for the Western eye to appreciate. Landscape paintings from the 20th-century Guangdong and Lingnan schools form the bulk of the collection, and modern calligraphy also gets a nod.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Contemporary Hong Kong Art Gallery showcases a mix of traditional Chinese and Western techniques—often in the same work. Paintings account for most of the pieces from the first half of the 20th century, when local artists used the traditional mediums of brush and ink in innovative ways. Western techniques dominate later work, the result of Hong Kong artists spending more time abroad. hk.art.museum. COST: HK$10. OPEN: Fri. and Sun.-Wed. 10-6, Sat. 10-8. Metro: Tsim Sha Tsui MTR, Exit E. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hong Kong Heritage Museum</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This fabulous museum is Hong Kong\'s largest, yet it still seems a well-kept secret: chances are you\'ll have most of its 10 massive galleries to yourself. They ring an inner courtyard, which pours light into the lofty entrance hall.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The New Territories Heritage Hall is packed with local history—6,000 years of it. See life as it was in beautiful dioramas of traditional villages—one on land, the other on water (with houses-on-stilts). There\'s also lots of info and artifacts related to religion and festivals. The last gallery documents the rise of massive urban New Towns. There\'s even a computer game where you can design your own.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the T. T. Tsui Gallery of Chinese Art exquisite antique Chinese glass, ceramics, and bronzes fill nine hushed second-floor rooms. The curators have gone for quality over quantity. Look for the 4-foot-tall terra-cotta Horse and Rider, a beautiful example of the figures enclosed in tombs in the Han Dynasty (206BC-AD220). The Tibetan religious statues and <i>thankga</i> paintings are unique in Hong Kong.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Cantonese Opera Hall is all singing, all dancing, and utterly hands-on. The symbolic costumes, tradition-bound stories, and stylized acting of Cantonese opera can be impenetrable: the museum provides simple explanations and stacks of artifacts, including century-old sequined costumes that put anything Vegas dreams up to shame.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kids love the Children\'s Discovery Gallery, where hands-on activities for 4- to 10-year-olds include dressing up in traditional Hakka gear and putting a broken \"archaeological find\" back together. The Hong Kong Toy Story, charting more than a century of local toys, brings a whole new dimension to that Made in Hong Kong tag in the toy box. hk.heritage.museum. COST: HK$20; HK$10 Wed. OPEN: Mon., Wed.-Sat. 10-6, Sun., holidays 10-7. Metro: Che Kung or Sha Tin KCR. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Victoria Peak</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Its Chinese name, Tai Ping Shan, means Mountain of Great Peace, and it certainly seems to inspire momentary hushed awe in visitors at the viewing point, a few yards left along the road from the tram terminal. Spread below you is a glittering forest of skyscrapers; beyond them the harbor and—on a clear day—Kowloon\'s eight mountains. On a rainy day wisps of cloud catch on the buildings\' pointy tops; at night both sides of the harbor burst into color. Consider having dinner at one of the restaurants near the upper terminus. Forsake all else up here and start your visit with the lookout point: there are a hundred other shopping ops in the world, but few views like this.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As you step off the Peak Tram, the feeling that you left your stomach somewhere down in Central disappears. The cure? A sharp intake of breath and bout of sighing over the view. Whatever the time, whatever the weather, be it your first visit or your 50th, this is Hong Kong\'s one unmissable sight. Before buying a return ticket down on the tram, consider taking one of the beautiful low-impact trails back to Central. There are also buses down.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are spectacular views in all directions on the <b>Peak Circle Walk,</b> an easy-going 2.2 mi (3.5-km) paved trail that starts at the Upper Tram Terminus. Start by heading north along fern-encroached Lugard Road. There\'s another stunning view of Central from the lookout, 20 minutes along, after which the road snakes west to an intersection with Hatton and Harlech roads. From here Lantau, Lamma, and—on incredibly clear days—Macau come into view. The longer option from here is to wind your way down Hatton to the University of Hong Kong campus in the Western district. The <b>Peak Galleria</b> mall scores high on nothing else but the cheese scale. Bypass the overpriced tourist traps inside and head straight up the escalators to the third-floor viewing gallery, which looks down over the Pok Fu Lam country park and reservoir, and, on a clear day, Aberdeen. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Star Ferry</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Since 1898 the ferry pier has been the gateway to the island for people from Kowloon. If it\'s your first time in the city, you\'re all but required to cross the harbor and back on the Star Ferry at least once. It\'s a beautiful, relaxing trip on antiquated, characterful vessels. An evening ride is even better, when the city\'s neon and skyscrapers light up the sky. The distinctive green-and-white vessels are beloved harbor fixtures; many people prefer the gentle, smooth sailing trip to one on the busy MTR. The ferry\'s home is Pier 7 of the Outlying Islands Ferry Piers.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are two classes: a first-class ticket (HK$2.20) gives you a seat on the upper deck, with its air-conditioned compartments. Second-class seats (HK$1.70) are on the lower deck and tend to be noisy because they\'re near the engine room. For very different experiences, try the upper deck one way and the lower deck on the other. For trips from Central to Tsim Sha Tsui, seats on the eastern side have the best views—the ferries don\'t turn around, though, so remember to swing the seats so that you face forward.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Across the way, the pier makes a convenient starting point for any tour of Kowloon. (It also has a bus terminal, which sends buses to all parts of Kowloon and to the New Territories.) As you face the bus station, Ocean Terminal, where luxury cruise ships berth, is on your left; inside this terminal, and in adjacent Harbour City, are miles of air-conditioned shopping arcades. www.starferry.com.hk. OPEN: Central to/from Tsim Sha Tsui, daily 6:30AM-11:30PM. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Peak Tram</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hong Kong is very proud of the fact that its funicular railway is the world\'s steepest. Before it opened in 1880 the only way to get up Victoria Peak, the highest hill overlooking Hong Kong Harbour, was to walk or take a bumpy ride in a sedan chair on steep steps. You really can\'t afford to miss the thrilling tram journey. On the way up, grab a seat on the right-hand side for the best views of the harbor and mountains. The trams, which look like old-fashioned trolley cars, are hauled the whole way in seven minutes by cables attached to electric motors. En route to the upper terminal, 1,805 feet above sea level, the cars pass five intermediate stations. At times they seem to travel at an impossibly vertical angle, but don\'t fret; it\'s all perfectly safe.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the top you immediately enter the Peak Tower, a mall full of restaurants, shops, and amusements such as Madame Tussaud\'s wax museum. There\'s a viewing platform on the mall\'s roof. Outside the Peak Tower, another mall faces you. Well-signed nature walks around the Peak are wonderful respites from the commercialism. Bus 15C, an antique double-decker with an open top, shuttles you to the Peak Tram Terminal from Edinburgh Place, next to City Hall. www.thepeak.com.hk. COST: HK$22 one way, HK$33 round-trip. OPEN: Daily every 10-15 mins, 7:30AM-midnight. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Tian Tan Buddha</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hong Kongers love superlatives, even if making them true requires strings of qualifiers. So the Tian Tan Buddha is the world\'s largest Buddha—that\'s seated, located outdoors, and made of bronze. It doesn\'t need the epithets: its vast silhouette against the sky is impressive. Steep stairs lead to the lower podium, essentially forcing you to stare up at all 242½ tons of Buddha as you ascend. At the top, cool breezes and fantastic views over Lantau Island await.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Po Lin Monastery.</b> It\'s hard to believe today, but from its foundation in 1927 through the early \'90s, this monastery was virtually inaccessible by road. These days, it\'s at the heart of Lantau\'s biggest attraction. The monastery proper has a gaudy, commercial, orange temple complex. Still, it\'s the Buddha people come for.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Wisdom Path.</b> This peaceful path runs beside 38 halved tree trunks arranged in an infinity shape on a hillside. Each is carved with Chinese characters that make up the Heart Sutra, a 5th-century Buddhist prayer that expresses the doctrine of emptiness. The idea is to walk around the path—which takes 5 minutes—and reflect. To reach it, follow the signposted trail to the left of the Buddha.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Ngong Ping Village.</b> People were fussing about this attraction before its first stone was laid. Ngong Ping Village is a money-making add-on to the Tian Tan Buddha. Indeed, if a journey here is one of enlightenment, then Nirvana is much easier to reach than previously thought. Walking With Buddha is intended to be an educational stroll through the life of Siddartha Gautama, the first Buddha, but it\'s more of a multimedia extravaganza that shuns good taste with such kitsch as a self-illuminating Bodhi tree and piped-in incense. No cost has been spared in the dioramas that fill the seven galleries—ironic, given that each represents a stage of the Buddha\'s path to enlightenment and the eschewing of material wealth. www.plm.org.hk/blcs/en/index.asp. COST: Monastery and path free. Walking with Buddha: HK$35. OPEN: Buddha daily 9:30-6:30. Monastery and path daily 9-6. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The waves are gentle enough for children. Kayakers are drawn to the Mokulua Islands offshore. Small convenience stores and restaurants are within walking distance. And there\'s just enough wind to keep you from baking. Paradise, but civilized.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Finding Shangri La</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Wealth allowed heiress Doris Duke to acquire the lavish seaside estate she called Shangri La. For most, that would have been enough. But Duke had a passion—Islamic art and architecture—and determination as well as money. She had a vision of courtyards and pleasure gardens and rooms that are themselves works of art. And she presided over every detail of the never-quite-finished project. The property, now a center for Islamic studies, is utterly unique and quite simply not to be missed.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Oahu After Hours</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Yes, you can have an umbrella drink at sunset. But in the multicultural metropolis of Honolulu, there\'s so much more to it than that. Sip a glass of wine and listen to jazz at Formaggio, join the beach-and-beer gang at Duke\'s Canoe Club, or head to Zanzabar, where DJs spin hip-hop and techno. Sample the sake at an <i>izakaya</i> (Japanese tavern) or listen to a performance by a Hawaiian musician. Snack on pupu, and begin your journey toward that unforgettable tropical sunrise.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hiking to Kaena Point</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If we had but one day to spend in rural Oahu, we\'d spend it walking the back road along the rocky shore at the island\'s northern tip. Kaena, a state park as well as a protected natural area, comprises 850 acres of undeveloped coastline that centers on the point where it is said the souls of the ancient dead leapt into the eternal darkness. The views are incomparable; shells can be scavenged in keyhole coves in calm weather; whales spout offshore during winter; and threatened native plants flourish. It\'s a trek that will change your mind about Oahu being \"too crowded.\"</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Catching a Wave</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Taking a surfing lesson from a well-muscled beach boy has been a Honolulu must-do since the first gay divorcée stepped off the first cruise ship. Waikiki, with its well-shaped but diminutive waves, remains the perfect spot for grommets (surfing newbies), though surf schools operate at beaches (and many hotels) around the island. Most companies guarantee at least one standing ride in the course of a lesson. And catching that first wave? We guarantee you\'ll never forget it.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Exploring Chinatown</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chinatown is like one of those centerpiece lazy susans: turn it this way, and you find one thing; turn it another, and there\'s something else. The various guided tours of this compact and busy neighborhood each offer up a different dish: one focuses on food and restaurants, another shines a light on cultural attractions, and the occasional architect-led AIA tour delves into the area\'s design character. Take your pick or wander on your own. Just don\'t miss this unique mixed plate.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hula with Heart</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Professional hula dancers—the ones in poolside hotel shows and dinner extravaganzas—are perfection: hands like undulating waves, smiles that never waiver. But if you want to experience hula with heart, scan the newspapers for a hula school fund-raiser, or ask the activities desk about local festivals. You may see some missteps and bumbles, but you\'ll also experience different hula styles and hear songs and chants deeply rooted in the culture, all the while surrounded by the scents of a hundred homemade lei.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Sail on the Wild Side</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Who wouldn\'t want these memory snapshots to take home: the unblinking and seemingly amused eye of a spinner dolphin as it arcs through the wake of the catamaran in which you\'re riding; the undulating form of an endangered green sea turtle swimming below you; the slap and splash and whoosh of a humpback whale breaching in full view on indigo seas. Wild Side Specialty Tours can\'t promise these specific encounters, but their ecologically conscious daily excursions in a quiet, uncrowded catamaran do guarantee good memories.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Day on the North Shore</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">\"Hano Hano, Haleiwa,\" the song says—Beautiful Haleiwa. Also fun, funky, fast-moving, family-friendly Haleiwa—an easy place in which to while away half a day. Visit the quirky surf museum, wander through the surf shops, choose from half a dozen good but cheap restaurants, suck up some refreshing shave ice, find one-of-a-kind clothes and gifts, and charter a catamaran or fishing boat. Then head back the long way to town (along the east side of the island) along a route that takes you past world-renowned surf spots.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Trip to Japan</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Little known outside Oahu\'s growing community of Japanese nationals is a class of small restaurant/bars called <i>izakaya</i> or Japanese taverns. Even newer on the scene are <i>okonomi,</i> hip spots that specialize in Osaka-style grilled omelets and potent Japanese spirits. Both are like a visit to Japan, minus the long plane ride, and, though pricey, the à la carte menus are unfailingly excellent—if distinctly odd. A must-notch in any foodie\'s belt.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Plate-Lunch Picnic</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Take a break the way the locals do: get a plate lunch (typically meat with two scoops of macaroni salad and two scoops of rice), then find a park or beach. Don\'t pack a ton of stuff, don\'t stick to a schedule. Eat, talk-story (local slang for chatting), take a nap, or people-watch—then explore, walk, swim, or snorkel. Some options: Mitsu-Ken Catering, then a picnic on the grounds of the nearby Bishop Museum; Fukuya Delicatessen, then Kahala Beach Park; Diamond Head Market and Grill, then Waikiki Beach or Kapiolani Park; L&amp;L Drive-Inn, then Kailua Beach.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Walking in the Rain Forest or to a Waterfall</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Wend your way through the hillside neighborhood of Aiea, northwest of Honolulu, and suddenly you\'re in a cool, green park, scented with astringent eucalyptus. This is the 3½-mi Aiea Loop Trail and if you\'re committed to squeezing a hike into a short Oahu stay, you couldn\'t do better for glimpses of hidden valleys and the experience of an island forest.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If waterfalls are more your speed, then head straight to the back of Manoa Valley, 3 mi mauka (or toward the mountains from Waikiki) and you\'ll find a 1½-mi trail along a well-worn path following Manoa stream through native trees and flowers to the Manoa Falls.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pearl Harbor</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pearl Harbor is an almost all-day investment. Be on the grounds by 7:30 AM to line up for Arizona Memorial tickets. Clamber all over the USS <i>Bowfin</i> submarine. Finally, take the free trolley to see the \"Mighty Mo\" battleship. If it\'s Wednesday or Saturday, make the 5-minute drive mauka (toward the mountains) for bargain-basement shopping at the sprawling Aloha Stadium Swap Meet.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Southeast & Windward Exploring</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For sand, sun, and surf, follow H1 east to keyhole-shaped Hanauma Bay for picture-perfect snorkeling, then round the southeast tip of the island with its windswept cliffs and the famous Halona Blowhole. Fly a kite or watch body surfers at Sandy Beach. Take in Sea Life Park. In Waimanalo, stop for local-style plate lunch, or punch on through to Kailua, where there\'s intriguing shopping and good eating.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It is a long, sloping beach with numerous surf breaks, but it is also mild enough at shore for older children to play freely. It has views of Pearl Harbor and, over that, Diamond Head. Although the sand lives up to its name, the real joy of this beach comes from its history as part of a military property for the better part of a century, leaving it unchanged. Expansive parking, great restroom facilities, and numerous tree-covered barbecue areas make it a great day-trip spot. As a bonus, a Hawaiian monk seal takes up residence here several months out of the year (seals are rarely seen anywhere in the Islands). </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The exterior wall of a volcanic crater collapsed thousands of years ago, opening it to the sea and thereby giving birth to Oahu\'s most famous snorkeling destination. Even from the overlook, the horseshoe-shape bay is a beauty, and you can easily see the reefs through the clear aqua waters. The wide beach is a great place for sunbathing and picnics. This is a marine conservation district, and regulations prohibit feeding the fish. Visitors are required to go through the Education Center before trekking down to the bay. The center provides a cultural history of the area and exhibits about the importance of protecting its marine life. Check out the \"Today at the Bay\" exhibit for up-to-date information on daily tides, ocean safety warnings, and activities. Food concessions and equipment rentals are also on-site. Come early to get parking, as the number of visitors allowed per day is limited. Also note that the bay is best in the early hours before the waters are churned up. Call for current conditions. Thursday evening lectures, Saturday morning field trips, and Saturday night Hanauma Bay by Starlight events (extending opening hours to 10 PM) are held weekly. www.honolulu.gov/parks/facility/hanaumabay/index.htm. COST: $5; parking $1; mask, snorkel, and fin rental $6; tram from parking lot $1.50 round-trip. OPEN: Wed.-Mon. 6-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Iolani Palace</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">America\'s only royal residence was built in 1882 on the site of an earlier palace, and it contains the thrones of King Kalakaua and his successor (and sister) Queen Liliuokalani. Bucking the stereotype of the primitive islander, the palace had electricity and telephone lines installed even before the White House. Downstairs galleries showcase the royal jewelry, and kitchen and offices of the monarchy. The palace is open for guided or self-guided audio tours, and reservations are essential. If you\'re set on taking a guided tour, call for reservations a few days in advance. The gift shop was formerly the Iolani Barracks, built to house the Royal Guard. www.iolanipalace.org. COST: $20 guided tour, $12 audio tour, $6 downstairs galleries only. OPEN: Tues.-Sat. 9-2, guided tours every 15 mins 9-11:15, self-guided audio tours 11:45-3:30. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kailua Beach Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A cobalt-blue sea, and a wide continuous arc of powdery sand make Kailua Beach Park one of the island\'s best beaches, illustrated by the crowds of local families that spend their weekend days here. This is like a big Lanikai Beach, but a little windier and a little wider, and a better spot for spending a full day. Kailua Beach has calm water, a line of palms and ironwoods that provide shade on the sand, and a huge park with picnic pavilions where you can escape the heat. This is the \"it\" spot if you\'re looking to try your hand at wind- or kiteboarding. You can rent kayaks nearby at <b>Kailua Sailboards and Kayaks</b> (130 Kailua Rd.tel. 808/262-2555) and take them to the Mokulua Islands for the day. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Waimea Bay</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Made popular in that old Beach Boys song \"Surfin\' U.S.A.,\" Waimea Bay is a slice of big-wave heaven, home to king-size 25- to 30-foot winter waves. Summer is the time to swim and snorkel in the calm waters. The shore break is great for novice bodysurfers. Due to its popularity, the postage-stamp parking lot is quickly filled, but everyone parks along the side of the road and walks in. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Makapuu Beach</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A magnificent beach protected by Makapuu Point welcomes you to the Windward side. Hang gliders circle above the beach, and the water is filled with body boarders. Just off the coast you can see Bird Island, a sanctuary for aquatic fowl, jutting out of the blue. The currents can be heavy, so check with a lifeguard if you\'re unsure of safety. Before you leave, take the prettiest (and coldest) outdoor shower available on the island. Being surrounded by tropical flowers and foliage while you rinse off that sand is a memory you will cherish from this side of the rock. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It begins with the trail rides... suddenly, the highways and byways leading into the nation\'s fourth-largest city are filled with cowboys and cowgirls of all ages, races, and sizes, all galloping toward the annual Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. The huge event at Reliant Park (the complex that houses the Astrodome) brings the entire city together with big-time entertainment (all the biggest country stars, plus crowd-pleasers like Hannah Montana, Fergie, John Legend, and Beyoncé, to name a few recent performers), plus livestock auctions, a chili cook-off, carnival rides, and rodeo competitions. The calf scramble and chuck-wagon races are always fun to watch, and all events benefit a scholarship fund that doles out millions of dollars in support each year.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Unlike the trail riders, you don\'t have to ride your horse to get there: off-site parking and shuttles operate from all over the city, or you can take the convenient METROrail. Be warned, though: this is one time of the year when you\'ll have to book a hotel room way in advance.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Tour Houston By METRORail</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Board METRORail at <b>UH-Downtown</b> (One Main Street), housed in the \"M&amp;M\" Building, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The University moved here in 1974 and quickly built up the neighborhood campus. As you travel over the bayou, look to your left and you\'ll see <b>Allen\'s Landing</b> (1001 Commerce St.) It was here in 1836 that brothers August C. Allen and John K. Allen stepped ashore and founded the Bayou City.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Exit at the <b>Main Street Square</b> stop (Main St. between Walker &amp; Dennis) for downtown\'s pedestrian-only central plaza, with dramatic water fountains and landscaping, plus easy access to shopping. The flagship <b>Macy\'s</b> (formerly Foley\'s, at 1110 Main St.) spans an entire city block and is 10 stories tall. A block south at 1212 Main is <b>The Tipping Point,</b> home of limited-edition sneakers. They have great books, too.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Back on the train! The next action-packed stop is <b>Ensemble Theater/Houston Community College.</b> Exit here, and in addition to the theater and the school you\'ll find a midtown block of Main Street filled with stores and entertainment options. Hungry? Stop in at the hippie-dippy <b>Tacos-A-Go-Go</b> (3704 Main St.) for cheap, homemade, and delicious Tex-Mex (breakfast is served all day). Next door is the comic, toy, and vinyl emporium (and art gallery) <b>Sig\'s Lagoon,</b> open late for interesting shopping. Also on this block are nightlife spots like the <b>Continental Club, The Big Top,</b> and <b>The Mink,</b> as well as Latin-inspired <b>Julia\'s Bistro.</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the <b>Wheeler</b> rail stop, it\'s just a short walk to <b>Lawndale Art Center,</b> in the former Barker Brothers Studio at 4912 Main St. (originally designed in 1931 by noted Houston architect Joseph Finger, who also designed City Hall). Lawndale exhibits contemporary works in all mediums; see what\'s new at www.lawndaleartcenter.org.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Minutes later, you\'re at the <b>Museum District</b> stop on San Jacinto between Ewing and Binz. No matter which way you turn, you\'ll be at a major museum within minutes. You\'re also steps away from the <b>Hotel ZaZa</b> (formerly The Warwick), Houston\'s newest, splashiest, and showiest hotel, where everything is over the top—including many of the guests.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Hermann Park/Rice University</b> stop brings you to Houston\'s leading university and its leafy 300-acre campus, as well as the city\'s \"Central Park.\" Sail through the skyscraper canyons of the <b>Texas Medical Center</b>—the largest in the world—and before long you\'ll find yourself at the <b>Reliant Park</b> stop, where the massive retractable-roof <b>Reliant Stadium</b> is home to the rodeo and the NFL\'s Houston Texans. It replaced the nearby, now-empty <b>Astrodome.</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">—Tim Moloney</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Getting There & Around</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">All major airlines fly into either Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport on the city\'s north side or the smaller Hobby Airport on the southeast side. Continental Airlines dominates Intercontinental, and Southwest rules Hobby. Hobby is much more convenient to downtown.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Houstonians love their cars—which may explain why public transportation here is sorely lacking compared to other large U.S. cities. Things are slowly improving, though. In 2004 METRO, Houston\'s transit authority, opened the city\'s first light-rail line, which runs along Main St. from UH-Downtown to Reliant Park, home of the NFL Texans. Initially viewed as a novelty, ridership for the train has really taken off, and several new routes are already on the drawing board and/or approved. Many of Houston\'s top attractions are on the current light-rail line, and METRO\'s bus system provides access to other parts of the city. Amtrak also has a station in Houston, right behind the Main Post Office on Franklin St.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For the foreseeable future, the best way to see Houston is by car with a good map (or a GPS unit). Parking spots are generally plentiful and free; the only places you\'ll pay to park are in the Medical Center and downtown.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes, tollways, and crosstown connectors have reduced traffic congestion, but all of Houston\'s highways can be extremely crowded during rush hours. Driving isn\'t too treacherous during non-rush hours, but give yourself plenty of time—the trip from downtown to George Bush Intercontinental Airport can take 25 minutes—or more than an hour, depending on traffic.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Along its narrow lanes, bangle sellers vie for space with prayer mat vendors, <i>attar</i> (perfume) merchants, <i>waraq</i> (silver leaf) makers, <i>naan</i> (tandoori bread) bakers, <i>Unani</i> doctors (who practice traditional Islamic medicine), hawkers of charms and spells, and outfitters of turbans and <i>sherwani</i> (a knee-length straight-cut coat, with a small round neck, worn by Muslim men).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The dull ring of the waraq maker\'s hammer against his layers of leather and silver mingles with the cries of the merchants and the bells of cycle taxis and cart drivers as you pass. If you ask for directions to any shop or landmark you may be told that it no longer exists, or that the people have gone away, or that you possibly mean some other shop or landmark. Don\'t be deterred: locals don\'t often deliberately mislead visitors; it\'s usually because they don\'t want to admit they don\'t know something, such as directions to a place, or because they may not recognize your pronunciation of a street or landmark\'s name. Ask a glass bangle seller for the whereabouts of a bidri or pearl shop, and he will tell you that there are no bidri or pearl shops in Hyderabad. Make sure you have a map and you\'ve got your bearings, or you might find it difficult to find your way out again.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Rural Theatre of Yakshagana</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When in Mangalore or Bangalore, don\'t miss an opportunity to watch a lively Yakshagana performance. Karnataka\'s own traveling rural theater form represents a unique blend of dance, music, narrative, stage techniques, and traditional costumes. Said to have originated more than five centuries ago, Yakshagana belongs to the coastal districts—Malnad, Uttar Kannada, and Dakshin Kannada—where troupes of actors travel from village to village, entertaining villagers who gather from miles around to watch them. Although often described as folk theater, it nonetheless has strong classical roots. The focus is typically Hindu mythology—performance begins with a <i>puja</i> (a ritual and offering) and is followed by enactment of scenes from the Hindu epics. The folk elements include the music, the language, the cross-dressing (there are no female actors), and the frequent appearance of mischief-makers and demons. Although the local language will be unfamiliar to you, it\'s still worthwhile to attend a performance for the sheer color and dynamism, the elaborate costumes, the make-up, the skilled and energetic performers, and the unmistakable humor. From the early 17th century, when a poet refashioned the entire <i>Ramayana</i> to suit the Yakshagana form, to the present day, when troupes perform nonclassical acts as well (anything from an original Kannada drama to a play based on Chekov), this living rural tradition has prospered and grown over the centuries. The best time to catch a yakshagana is between November and May; performances are few during the rainy season.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Thirty-five thousand items, which constitute one of the world\'s largest private collections, are crammed into 35 rooms. The fantastic Chola bronzes, European glass, Chinese jade, jeweled weapons, miniatures, and finely woven shawls take some time to look through, but they\'re well worth it. A small cafeteria overlooking a garden is a nice place to take a break. No cameras are allowed. COST: Rs. 150. OPEN: Sat.-Thurs. 10-5; ticket sales until 4:15. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hoysaleswara Temple</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Dedicated to Shiva, the Hoysaleswara Temple was begun by King Vishnuvardhana in 1121, after the one at Belur was complete. It was left unfinished after 190 years of labor because the Delhi sultanates\' attacks on it leveled its pyramid-peak roof. Like the temple at Belur, this one has a star-shaped plan, but as a double-shrine temple, it has two of everything—one for the king and one for the queen. Moreover, the sculptors\' virtuosity reached its peak here, leaving some 20,000 statues. The figures are carved in such detail that they appear to have been etched. You can see the taut fibers of the cord from which a drum hangs, feel the weight of the jewel beads dangling from a dancer\'s neck, almost hear the swinging of the bells around the arms of the elephant god Ganesh. At one time the temple also had 84 small statues hanging from the ceiling near pillars; all but 14 were seized by conquerors of one stripe or another.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The breathtaking friezes wrap all the way around the temple: first comes a row of elephants for stability, then a row of lordly lions for courage, then convoluting scrolls of swift horses, then a row of people in sexual poses. Indian philosophy has always merged the spiritual with the social and cultural. Consequently, religious monuments were also cultural centers. Temple sculptures from around the 8th century often depict images of musicians and dancers along with dieties; in about the 10th century, erotic themes were introduced as well. The inspiration for this was based on the tantric thought of congeniality between spirituality and sexuality. Sensual well-being was deemed an essential ingredient of social life. Following the invasion of Islamic rulers, this tendency was curbed.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Above the erotic scenes is more scrollwork as well as scenes from the religious epics that present philosophical ideas and mirror the living conditions of the time. The largest frieze is also the most exuberant: here the <i>apsaras</i> (celestial maidens) are clothed in jewels, with bracelets on each of their several arms. Behind the queen and the king\'s shrines (the one closest to the entrance) are giant sculptures of Nandi the bull, Shiva\'s vehicle, with beautifully smooth features and a polished belly that almost seems to breathe. A small museum next to the temple displays various statues and brass and copper figures excavated from the surrounding area. COST: Free; museum Rs. 2. OPEN: Temple daily sunrise-sunset; museum Sat.-Thurs. 10-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hampi</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most awesome spectable in Karnataka, Hampi was once the capital of the massive Vijayanagar Empire. What\'s now little more than a large town holds the ruins of a vast city of stone temples, elephant stables, barracks, and palaces—from the late 14th century until the 17th, this was the center of the largest Hindu empire in South India. Today the ruins are interesting from an archaeological standpoint as well as for their sheer beauty—stone structures rise out a boulder-dotted landscape made all the more beautiful by the winding Tungabhadra River. To see this World Heritage site in its entirety, count on spending at least two full days here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Legend has it that the city, which sprawls over 180 square km (70 square mi) in a rocky valley surrounded by rugged mountains, was founded by two brothers, Harihara and Bukka, in 1336. However, some of the buildings can be dated back 1,400 years. Hampi was a large, wealthy city of perhaps a half million people at its height. In 1565, however, a league of five neighboring Muslim powers conquered it, and it was during this time that the faces of the thousands of statues and sculptures on the numerous temples were broken off. Hampi was looted and burned for months, until it lay deserted and ruined.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many people choose to explore the ruins by themselves, but you\'ll probably get more out of them if you hire one of the official guides who wait on the road leading into the still-thriving Hampi Bazaar. They charge about Rs. 500-Rs. 600 for a full day. The best time to visit Hampi is from November to March; the rest of the year it\'s too hot or too rainy. Be prepared to do quite a lot of walking; vehicles cannot access many of the best spots in Hampi.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hampi is roughly divided into two section: the northern part has Hampi Bazaar and the Virupaksha Temple, and the southern zone contains remnants of the Royal Enclosure, where kings once lived. The distance from the Virupaksha temple to the Royal Enclosure is about 3 km (2 mi).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the center of Hampi\'s northern section is the enormous (and still-used) <b>Virupaksha Temple</b> (COST: Rs. 2. OPEN: daily sunrise-sunset), the home of hundreds of monkeys and a hangout for dozens of children intrigued by the sight of foreigners. The ancient temple—devoted to the patron deity of the Vijayanagar kings—has some old musical instruments and an interesting inverted pinhole image of its own tower cast on an inner wall. Outside the temple, the street called Hampi Bazaar was originally built for temple chariot processions; today it\'s also the center of life in the ruins—guides, money matters, and a cheap room for the night can all be arranged here. Half a kilometer south of the Virupaksha temple, two massive stone images of the elephant god Ganesha are ironically named sasivekalu and kadalekalu. The names, which mean \"mustard seed\" and \"chickpea,\" are perhaps the Vijayanagar equivalent of nicknaming a fat man \"Slim\" or a bald man \"Red.\" Make sure you see the monolithic sculpted image of the glaring man-lion Narasimha (a quarter-kilometer south of the Ganesha), and the small Shiva temple that houses a huge lingam half-submerged in water.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">About 2 km (1 mi) east of the Virupaksha Temple is the stunning <b>Vittala Temple</b> (COST: Temple US$5, camera fee Rs. 25. OPEN: daily sunrise-sunset), possibly the most rewarding of all the Hampi sights. This temple dedicated to Vishnu has an intact stone chariot and halls with intricately carved \"musical\" pillars that sound tones when the stone is tapped. Near the Vittala is the King\'s Balance, where the king\'s weight was measured every year against gold. Climb <b>Matanga Hill,</b> 1 km (½ mi) southeast from the Virupaksha Temple at dawn or just before sunset for one of the best possible views of the ruins—from this hill close to the Virupaksha temple, you can see the spectacular ruins of the Achyutaraya temple complex, the Tungabhadra flowing through rocks and boulders, and the cream-color tower of the Virupaksha itself. There\'s a lovely little temple on top of this hill, but do not go up alone near sunrise or sunset—robberies and worse have been known to happen in this isolated spot.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In what\'s known as the Royal Enclosure area, a great stone platform, called the <b>Mahanavami Dibba</b> (House of Victory), is where the king used to watch proceedings at festival time. About 100 meters to the south is an excavated <b>bath,</b> said to have been used by the king. It\'s fed by a raised aqueduct, and has reducing steps of sharply carved green schist. About ¼ km northwest of the Mahanavami Dibba, is the intricately sculpted <b>Hazara Rama temple,</b> where the royals may have worshipped in private.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Approximately ½ km north of the Hazara Rama temple is a walled complex called the Zenana Enclosure, said to have been the dwelling of the royal ladies and their entourage. The Lotus Mahal inside is one of the few intact buildings in Hampi. Just outside the enclosure are the towering <b>Elephant Stables,</b> once home to the 11 elephants of the royal guard. On the road to Kamalapur, just outside the royal enclosure is the <b>Queen\'s Bath.,</b> still elegant for all its current lack of water.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Archaeological Museum</b> (COST: Rs. 5. OPEN: Sat.-Thurs. 10-5) in the southern part of the ruins takes you through the (ongoing) excavation process and displays many of the weapons and cooking utensils found at Hampi, as well as some original temple statues. Snakes hide in the museum\'s gardens, so be careful where you walk. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Legend has it that the house was built in the 1400s for Duke Friedrich (otherwise known as Friedl the Penniless), and that the indignant duke had the original roof covered with gold to counter the rumor that he was poor. In truth, the 15th-century house was owned by Maximilian I, who added a balcony in 1501 as a sort of \"royal box\" for watching street performances in the square below. The structure was altered and expanded at the beginning of the 18th century, and now only the loggia and the alcove are identifiable as original. Maximilian is pictured in the two central sculpted panels on the balcony. In the one on the left, he is with his first and second wives, Maria of Burgundy and Bianca Maria Sforza of Milan; on the right, he is pictured with an adviser and a court jester.

You can hear some of the country\'s best singing by the valley residents and listen to expert harp and zither playing, for which the valley is famous. Tradition runs strong here: witness the Perchtenlaufen, processions of colorfully masked well-wishers going the neighborhood rounds on January 5, or the annual Almabtrieb during the last September and first October days, when the cows are decorated with wreaths and bells, and, amid celebrations, herded back from the high Alpine pastures into the lower fields and barns. This is a typical Tyrolean country town, with Alpine lodges and a round-dome pink village church (note the Baroque painting of the Holy Trinity); in winter it\'s a center for skiing and sports. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

On May 11, 330, the city was officially renamed \"New Rome,\" though it soon became known as Constantinople, the city of Constantine. Constantine\'s successors expanded the city and gave it new walls, aqueducts, and churches.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Under the emperor Justinian (ruled 527-65) Constantine\'s capital reached its apogee, with the construction of the magnificent Hagia Sophia, or Church of the Holy Wisdom (known as Aya Sofya in Turkish) on the site of a church originally built for Constantine. This awe-inspiring architectural wonder still dominates Istanbul\'s skyline. Constantinople became the largest, wealthiest metropolis the Western world had ever seen.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Byzantine Empire began to decline toward the end of the 11th century and a devastating blow came in 1204, when the western Europeans of the Fourth Crusade, who were supposed to be on their way to recapture Jerusalem, decided that instead of going another thousand miles to fight a load of Muslims, they\'d sack and occupy Constantinople, forcing members of the Byzantine dynasty to flee to Trabzon on the Black Sea coast. The Byzantines eventually regained control, but neither the city nor the Byzantine Empire recovered.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Constantinople was more of a collection of villages set amongst ruins than a city. Byzantine artists set to work, however, to restore and redecorate the damaged churches, and in their work in the mosaics and frescos of the church of the Holy Savior in Chora, we can see the first breath of the renaissance that would be carried west to Italy by artists and intellectuals fleeing the arrival of the Turks.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Ottoman sultan Mehmet II, known as Fatih (the Conqueror), conquered the much-diminished Constantinople in 1453, rebuilt it, and made the city once again the capital of a great empire. The Turks officially named the new city as Konstantiniyye, but in time ConSTANtinoPLe was shortened to \"Stanbul\" by the Greeks and westerners, and to \"Istanbul,\" by the Turks.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1468 Mehmet II began building a palace on the hill at the tip of the city where the Golden Horn meets the Bosphorus. Later sultans embellished and extended the building until it grew into the fabulous Topkapi Sarayi. Most of the finest Ottoman buildings in Istanbul, however, date from the time of Süleyman the Magnificent (ruled 1520-1566), who led the Ottoman Empire to its highest achievements in art and architecture, literature, and law. Süleyman and his court commissioned the brilliant architect Sinan (1489-1587) to design buildings that are now recognized as some of the greatest examples of Islamic architecture in the world, including such mosques as the magnificent Süleymaniye, the intimate Sokollu Mehmet Pasa, and the exquisitely tiled Rüstem Pasa. The monuments built by these titans, or in their honor, dominate and define the city of Istanbul and lead you into the arms of the past at every turn.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Magnificent Mosques</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are a lot of mosques in Istanbul. You won\'t have time to see them all, but you shouldn\'t leave the city without taking in the beauty and spirituality of at least several that rank as some of the most stunning architectural achievements in the world:</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Blue Mosque, for the sheer spectacle of domes, semidomes, minarets, and the 20,000 shimmering blue-green Iznik tiles that lend the mosque its name.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rüstem Pasa Cami, for Iznik tiles in a magnificent array of colors and patterns.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Süleymaniye Cami, for its size, austere beauty, the enormous dome that seems to be held up principally by divine cooperation, and the tombs of the architect Sinan, his patron Süleyman the Magnificent, and the sultan\'s wife, Roxelana.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sokollu Mehmet Pasa Rüstem, for elegance, harmony, and sumptuous tile work.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sky-High Dining</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In recent years, Istanbul\'s newest restaurants have been aiming high, literally, as an increasing number of savvy restauranteurs take advantage of the city\'s greatest natural asset—its spectacular views—and opened rooftop dining spots. The trend has been especially pronounced in the Beyoglu neighborhood, which sits on a ridge overlooking the Bosphorus, the Golden Horn, and the sights of Sultanahmet; here you\'ll have the chance to eat dinner while looking at both Europe and, across the water, Asia. This is real intercontinental dining.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Two restaurants—<b>360 Istanbul,</b> atop a historic apartment building, and <b>Mikla,</b> at the top of the 18-story Marmara Pera hotel, have spectacular 360-degree views. (If you\'re choosing between the two, Mikla is, generally speaking, for an older crowd, while 360 Istanbul is a good place to get a glimpse of the city\'s younger elite.) The open-air (therefore summer only) <b>NuTeras</b> is a chic bar that serves excellent mezes and looks out on the Golden Horn. <b>Leb-i Derya</b> serves adequate fare on a lovely and breezy terrace bar where you can watch the sunset over the Bosphorus.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The museum was created in the 1890s, when forward-thinking archaeologist and painter Osman Hamdi Bey campaigned to keep native antiquities and some items from the former countries of the Ottoman Empire in Turkish hands. The most stunning pieces are tombs that include the so-called Alexander Sarcophagus, from Lebanon, carved with scenes from Alexander the Great\'s battles and once believed, wrongly, to be his final resting place. An excellent exhibit on Istanbul through the ages shows off artifacts from prehistory through the Byzantines and Ottomans, and helps put the city\'s complex past in context. There is also an extensive collection of classical sculpture and even a model Trojan horse for the kids.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Another building in the courtyard of Topkapi Sarayi houses the <b>Eski Sark Eserleri Müzesi</b> (Museum of the Ancient Orient), where you will be transported to even earlier times: The vast majority of the panels, mosaics, obelisks, and other artifacts here, from Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and elsewhere in the Arab world, date from the pre-Christian centuries. A particularly intricate tablet is the Treaty of Kadesh from the 13th century BC, perhaps the world\'s earliest known peace treaty, an accord between the Hittite king Hattusilis III and the Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II. The <b>Çinili Köskü</b> (Tiled Pavilion) is one of the most visually pleasing sights in all of Istanbul—a bright profusion of colored tiles covers this one-time hunting lodge of Mehmet the Conqueror, and inside are ceramics from the early Seljuk and Ottoman empires, as well as tiles from Iznik, the city that produced perhaps the finest ceramics in the world during the 17th and 18th centuries. In summer, you can mull over these glimpses into the distant past as you sip coffee or tea at the café in the garden. COST: $8 (total) for the 3 museums. OPEN: Archaeology Museum: Tues.-Sun. 9:30-5, ticket sales until 4:30. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Selimiye Cami</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Edirne\'s Selimiye Cami (Selimiye Mosque), not to be confused with Istanbul\'s Süleymaniye, is the mosque Sinan described as his masterpiece, and it\'s certainly one of the most beautiful buildings in Turkey. It stands out from afar on the Thracian plain, virtually a symbol of the city. Sinan was 85 years old when the mosque was completed in 1574, and today a statue of the architect stands in front, though the mosque remains his greatest monument. Outside, four identical and slender minarets rise high, each with three balconies. Inside, the harmony and peacefulness of the space are immediately striking: The central dome, more than 100 feet in diameter and 148 feet high, rests on eight pillars that have been set into the walls so as not to disturb the spacious interior, and external buttresses help support the weight of 999 windows—legend has it that Sultan Selim thought 1,000 might be a bit greedy. The minarets are said to be the tallest in the Muslim world. The <i>medrese</i> (mosque compound) houses Edirne\'s <b>Türk-Islâm Eserleri Müzesi</b> (Museum of Turkish and Islamic Art), which displays Islamic calligraphy and other remnants of the city\'s Islamic past. COST: Free. OPEN: Daily sunrise-sunset. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kariye Müzesi</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The dazzling mosaics and frescoes in the former Church of the Holy Savior in Chora are considered to be among the finest Byzantine works in the world. Most of the mosaics, in 50 panels, depict scenes from the New Testament and date from the 14th century. They are in splendid condition, having been plastered over when the church became a mosque in the 16th century and were not uncovered until the 1940s. A cluster of Ottoman buildings surrounding the former church have also been restored, making this out-of-the-way corner of the city especially atmospheric. \"Chora\" comes from the Greek word for countryside; the church was originally outside the city walls that were built by Constantine the Great, but at the beginning of the 5th century AD Theodosius built new fortifications to expand the growing city, which brought the church inside the walls. The modern entrance is off to the side of the church, but it\'s best to head straight to the original front door, in the outer narthex. Here, a large figure of Christ bears the phrase \"I am the land (Chora) of the Living.\" This door leads to the inner narthex, where you can see the mosaic of Theodore Metochites, a kind of Byzantine prime minister, presenting the church to Christ. Metochites was responsible for the restoration and redecoration of the church after the damage of the fourth crusade. To the left is a series of mosaics depicting the early life of the Virgin Mary: moving clockwise, the series starts at the far end with her parents, Joachim and Anne, her first steps, her service in the temple, her marriage to Joseph, and, finally, the Annunciation. Above in the dome are the ancestors of the Virgin. The story continues back in the outer narthex, at the same far end, with the journey of Mary and Joseph to Egypt. It continues in one long circle of the outer narthex, with the nativity, the wise men before Herod and, at the far end, the massacre of the innocents, continuing gruesomely over several scenes, and finally ending with the return from Egypt and the presentation of the young Jesus in the temple. On the ceiling are various scenes from the ministry of Christ, including his temptation by the devil, the multiplication of loaves, and the transformation of water into wine. These continue into the other side of the inner narthex with scenes of Christ healing the sick and a vast wall mosaic, known as a Deesis, with Christ and the Virgin, and some tiny imperial figures. The church proper is light and airy but has lost most of its decoration, though a mosaic of the Dormition of the Virgin survives over the door. The large chapel was used for burials and contains several large tombs including that of Theodore Metochites, which is surrounded by saints and stories from the Old Testament. In the apse is a forceful image, called the Anastasis or \"Resurrection\"; it\'s one of the masterpieces of Byzantine art, with Christ hauling Adam and Eve from their tombs at the end of time. Above, Christ sits enthroned with the saved, whilst the damned are hauled down to hell and an angel rolls up the heavens like a scroll. COST: $12. OPEN: Thurs.-Tues. 9:30-4:30. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dolmabahçe Sarayi</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The name means \"filled-in garden,\" from the fact that Sultan Ahmet I (ruled 1603-17) had an imperial garden planted here on land reclaimed from the sea. In 1853, Abdül Mecit, whose free-spending lifestyle (his main distinction) bankrupted the empire, had this palace built as a symbol of Turkey\'s march away from its past and toward the European mainstream. He gave his Armenian architect, Nikogos Baliyan, complete freedom and an unlimited budget, the only demand being that the palace \"surpass any other palace of any other potentate anywhere in the world.\" The result, an extraordinary mixture of Turkish and European architecture and interior design, is a riot of rococo—marble, vast mirrors, stately towers, and formal gardens along a facade stretching nearly ½ km (¼ mi). Abdül Mecit\'s bed is solid silver; the tub and basins in his marble-paved bathroom are carved of translucent alabaster, and Europe\'s royalty helped contribute to the splendor: Queen Victoria sent a chandelier weighing 4½ tons, Czar Nicholas I of Russia provided polar-bear rugs. The result is as gaudy and showy as a palace should be, all gilt and crystal and silk, and every bit as garish as Versailles. Abdül Mecit\'s mother founded the nearby Dolmabahçe Cami (Dolmabahçe Mosque) in 1853. After the establishment of the modern republic in 1923, the palace became the home of Atatürk, who died here in 1938. The palace is divided into the public \"Selamlik\" and the private \"Harem,\" each of which can only be seen on separate oversized guided tours, which together take about 90 minutes. COST: Selamlik $12, Harem $8, Joint Ticket $16. OPEN: Tues.-Wed. and Fri.-Sun. 9-4 Last joint tickets sold at 3. Closes one hour earlier in winter. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Aya Sofya</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This soaring edifice is perhaps the greatest work of Byzantine architecture and for almost a thousand years, starting from its completion in 537, was the world\'s largest and most important religious monument. Only Saint Peter\'s in Rome, not completed until the 17th century, surpassed Aya Sofya in size and grandeur. It was the cathedral of Constantinople, the heart of its spiritual life, and the scene of imperial coronations. It was also the third church on this site: the second, which you can see the foundations of at the entrance, was burned down in the antigovernment Nika riots in 532. The Emperor Justinian commissioned the church and, in response to his dictum that Aya Sofya be the grandest place of worship ever built—far greater than the temples whose columns were incorporated in the church—craftsmen devised a magnificent dome. New architectural rules were made up as the builders went along and not all were foolproof, since the dome collapsed during an earthquake just two years after the church was completed. The church stood a shell until a new architect built a steeper dome, and the aged Justinian finally reopened the church on Christmas Eve 563. Subsequent repairs and such structural innovations as flying buttresses remained firmly in place, making it the prominent fixture it is on the Istanbul skyline to this day. Over the centuries Aya Sofya has survived additional earthquakes, looting crusaders, and the city\'s conquest by Mehmet the Conqueror in 1453.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mehmet II famously sprinkled dirt on his head before entering the church after the conquest as a sign of humility. His first order was for the blood to be cleaned off the walls and the images plastered over to convert the church into a mosque, and succeeding sultans added its four minarets. Atatürk made the Aya Sofya into a museum in 1936 and a project of restoration, including the uncovering of the mosaics began. In recent years there has been growing pressure for Aya Sofya to be reopened for Muslim worship, and some people gather to pray at the museum at midday on Friday.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As Justinian may well have intended, the impression that will stay with you longest, years after a visit, is the dome; as you enter the half domes trick you before the great space opens up with the immense dome, almost 18 stories tall and more than 30 meters (100 feet) across towering above—look up into it and you\'ll see the spectacle of thousands of gold tiles glittering in the light of 40 windows. The dome is believed to have originally been decorated with a giant cross, and the apse still displays a mosaic of the Virgin and child from the 9th century, which looks tiny but is actually 16 feet high. To the right of the Virgin is the archangel Gabriel, while Michael, on the left is mostly lost. Ongoing restoration has filled a quarter of the dome with an ugly scaffold for over a decade, and the project seems unlikely to be finished soon. Look for the special round disk on the floor, where the throne of the Byzantine emperors is believed to have stood. Upstairs is a central gallery once used by female worshipers. The north gallery is famous for its graffiti, ranging from Nordic runes to a complete Byzantine galley under sail. At the far end of the south gallery are several imperial portraits, including, on the left, the Empress Zoe, whose husband\'s face and name were clearly changed as she went through three of them. On the right is the Emperor with his Hungarian wife Irene and their son, Alexius, stuck around the corner. Heading back you will see the great 13th-century Deesis mosaic of Christ flanked by the Virgin and John the Baptist, breathing the life of the early Renaissance that Byzantine artists would carry west to Italy after the fall of the city—note how the shadows match the true light source to the left. On the way out, through the \"vestibule of the warriors\" a mirror reminds you to look back at the mosaics of Justinian and Constantine presenting the church and the city respectively to the Virgin Mary. COST: $16. OPEN: Tues.-Sun. 9-7, ticket sales until 6:30. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Blue Mosque</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Only after you enter the Blue Mosque do you understand why it is so named. Inside, 20,000 shimmering blue-green Iznik tiles are interspersed with 260 stained-glass windows; calligraphy and intricate patterns are painted on the ceiling. After the dark corners and stern, sour faces of the Byzantine mosaics in Aya Sofya, this light-filled mosque is positively uplifting. Such a favorable comparison was the intention of architect Mehmet Aga, known as Sedefkar (\"Worker of Mother-of-Pearl\"), whose goal was to surpass Justinian\'s crowning achievement (Aya Sofya). At the bequest of Sultan Ahmet I (ruled 1603-17), he spent just eight years creating this masterpiece of Ottoman craftsmanship, beginning in 1609, with the Sultan himself even lending a hand in the construction, and many believe he did indeed succeed in outdoing the splendor of Aya Sofya.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">But Mehmet Aga went a little too far when he surrounded the massive structure, studded with domes and semidomes, with six minarets: this number briefly linked the Blue Mosque with the Elharam Mosque in Mecca—and this could not be allowed. So Sultan Ahmet I was forced to send Mehmet Aga down to the Holy City to build a seventh minaret for Elharam and reestablish the eminence of that mosque. Ahmet, his wife, and his three sons are interred in the stunningly tiled <i>türbe</i> (mausoleum) at a corner of the complex, which at one time also included such traditional Muslim institutions as an almshouse, an infirmary, and a school. From here—or from the Hippodrome or any other good viewpoint—you can see the genius of Mehmet Aga, who didn\'t attempt to surpass the massive dome of Aya Sofya but instead created a secession of domes of varying sizes to cover the massive interior space, creating an effect that is both whimsical and uplifting. COST: Mosque free.

Every year, around 100 male camels tour the Marmara, Mediterranean, and the Aegean to compete in more than 30 wrestling festivals. Their primary motivation: get the girl. Camels will wrestle only during their mating season, which lasts from November to March, and a female camel is paraded around to provoke them into these contests. The camels\' mouths are tied during the match so that they can do no real harm to each other, and between the judges, separaters (<i>urganci</i>), and commentators (<i>cazgirs</i>), there are 21 officials (not including the camel owners) moderating the events.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A wrestling camel can expect to compete in 10 to 14 matches per year. The camels begin their wrestling \"career\" at age four, when they are purchased from Iran. They train for the next four years and spend years eight through 10 coming of age and developing their own strategies. Their right of passage, much like that of Turkish boys\' occurs at this age, when the camels receive <i>havuts,</i> decorative cloths with their name and the word <i>masallah</i> (may God protect him) sewn on the inside. According to camel owners and those familiar with the sport, wrestling is not a foreign, inhumane practice being imposed on the camels. On the contrary, these <i>dayluk</i> (as they\'re called until age seven, when they become <i>tülü</i> or hairy) begin wrestling naturally in the wild during their first years out of the womb, and if trained, can continue until age 25.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">People have different theories about camel-wrestling\'s origins, although many argue it was a nomadic practice and part of the competition between caravan owners. Nomadic or not, these festivals have become a deep-rooted cultural pastime in Turkey. Celebratory events actually begin the day before, during <i>hali gecesi,</i> or carpet night, when camels are flaunted around to percussive music, their bells jingling as they amble along. The camel owners, who often get to know one another during the pre-festivities, are also dolled up in cornered caps, traditional neck scarves, and accordion-like boots.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To prevent wearing out the camels, the matches last no more than 10 minutes, and camels compete only once a day. The victor, the camel who gets the most points for outsmarting his rival by swiftly maneuvering and having the most control over the match (which might simply mean not running away), can win anywhere from $2,500-$25,000, depending on the competition. There\'s usually a wrestling World Cup of sorts at the culmination of the festivals, in which the top camels compete.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The exact dates, times, and locations of the festivals change from year to year, but competitions are always held every Sunday from December to March. The central and southern Aegean cities of Selçuk, Izmir, Bodrum, and Kusadasi host camel-wrestling festivals. Local tourism offices will have specific information about that year\'s festivals. Tickets cost around $7 per match and can be purchased on-site.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">—Evin Dogu</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Beyond its shrines and antiquities, the limestone buildings, shaded courtyards, and colorful peoplescapes of the center city make for an absorbing experience. The first part of the walk—up to the YMCA—is good anytime; avoid the rest of it late Friday and on Saturday, when the downtown area shuts down for the Jewish Sabbath. The route will take 1½ hours to walk, not counting stops.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Begin at the landmark <b>Montefiore\'s Windmill,</b> across the valley from Mount Zion. Immediately below the adjacent patio is the long crenelated roof of Mishkenot Sha\'ananim, the first neighborhood outside the walls of Jerusalem, built by Sir Moses (Moshe) Montefiore in 1860.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Separating you from Mt. Zion and the Old City is the deep <b>Hinnom Valley,</b> the biblical border between the Israelite tribes of Judah (to the south) and Benjamin (to the north), and the site of human sacrificial rites in the 7th century BC. A few hundred yards off to your right is the fortress-like St. Andrew\'s Scots Church, right above the bend in the valley known as Ketef Hinnom (the Hinnom Shoulder). An excavation in the late 1970s on the rock scarp below the church uncovered rock-hewn tombs and a treasure trove of archaeological finds.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Stroll through the attractive cobblestone streets of the <b>Yemin Moshe</b> neighborhood, abutting the windmill, and up through the small park that separates it from King David Street. The landmark King David Hotel is a handsome, rectangular limestone building with a back terrace overlooking the Old City walls. Drinks and desserts are not cheap, but the location and Hollywood echoes (Paul Newman and Eva Marie Saint in <i>Exodus</i>) count for something. Across the street is the <b>YMCA</b>: its tower has stunning panoramas.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Turn onto Abraham Lincoln Street, alongside the YMCA and opposite the gas station. From the intersection 70 yards beyond it, a pedestrian lane (George Eliot Street) continues in the same direction, emerging at Agron Street, next to the U.S. Consulate-General. Cross Agron and walk over the lawns of <b>Independence Park.</b> The park\'s crossroad, 50 yards to your right, emerges at Hillel Street, where there are excellent coffee shops.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Across Hillel is Yoel Moshe Salomon Street, and to the right and parallel to it is Yosef Rivlin Street, named after two of the seven founders of <b>Nahalat Shiva,</b> the second neighborhood built outside the city walls, in 1869. Hidden courtyards, funky stores, and eateries make this a fun time-out option. At the other end of Salomon Street is Zion Square, where Jaffa Road, Jerusalem\'s main thoroughfare, is met by <b>Ben-Yehuda Street,</b> a pedestrian-only commercial street.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the top of Ben-Yehuda Street, cross King George Street, turn right, and take your first left onto Agrippas Street. (The corner falafel stand is your landmark.) A five-minute walk up the street, on your right, is the entrance to the colorful <b>Machaneh Yehuda</b> produce market. It extends for one city block, to Jaffa Road.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Walk in the City of David</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A walk-through-time adventure, this walk is a heady combination of mysterious tunnels and ancient remains. The climax is wading through the 2,700-year-old Hezekiah\'s Tunnel (water is knee- to thigh-deep; bring appropriate clothing, water shoes or sandals, and a flashlight; not recommended for very small children), though there is a dry exit from the site for nonwaders. Plan 1½ hours for the walk, and an additional 45 minutes to wade the tunnel. Note taht you can tour the sites on your own or, for a larger admission fee, on a guided tour.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A platform at the City of David Visitors Center gives a fine view of the Kidron Valley, which drops sharply to the east, and gave ancient Jerusalem its best protection. Steps descend to the excavation site <b>Area G,</b> and from there halfway down the hill to <b>Warren\'s Shaft</b> (small sign on the right). At the entrance to the shaft are enlargements of remarkable clay seals. A tunnel slopes down to the top of a shaft that drops 40 feet to the Gihon Spring. Conventional wisdom identifies this as the point where King David\'s commandos penetrated the city in 1000 BC, but recent excavations near the spring have suggested an alternative route.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A short flight of steps and a tunnel take you down through a cavernous structure with the massive foundations of 18th-century BC towers that once guarded the Gihon Spring, the original water supply of ancient Jerusalem. <b>Hezekiah\'s Tunnel,</b> also known as the Shiloah or Siloam Tunnel, was cut through the hill to secure the city\'s water supply in the face of the Assyrian invasion of 701 BC. It emerges at a small pool long identified as the New Testament \"Pool of Siloam\" where a blind man had his sight restored (John 9).</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

At the time of this writing, its entire main complex was closed for an $80 million \"renewal,\" with a reopening date of June 2010. New exhibits, fresh ideas, and state-of-the-art presentations will enhance the three main specialties of art, archaeology, and Judaica. Meanwhile, take time to explore what <i>is</i> open: the Dead Sea Scrolls in the white-domed Shrine of the Book, the 1:50 scale model of 1st-century-AD Jerusalem, the sculpture garden, and fascinating changing exhibits in the Youth Wing.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Dead Sea Scrolls</b> are certainly the Israel Museum\'s most famous—and most important—collection. The first of the 2,000-year-old scrolls were discovered by a Bedouin boy in 1947 in a Judean Desert cave, overlooking the Dead Sea. The adventures of these priceless artifacts before they found a permanent home here are the stuff of which Indiana Jones movies are made. The shape of the pavilion was inspired by the lids of the clay jars in which the first scrolls were found.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The scrolls were written in the Second-Temple period by a fundamentalist Jewish sect, conventionally identified as the Essenes, as they are referred to by contemporary historians. All archaeological, laboratory, and textual evidence dates the earliest of the scrolls to the 2nd century BC; none could have been written later than AD 68, the year in which their home community, known today as Qumran, was destroyed by the Romans. Written on parchment, and still in an extraordinary state of preservation because of the exceptional dryness of the Dead Sea region, the scrolls contain the oldest Hebrew manuscripts of the Old Testament ever found, authenticating the almost identical Hebrew texts still in use today. Sectarian literature includes \"The Rule of the Community,\" a sort of constitution of this ascetic group, and \"The War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness,\" a blow-by-blow account of a final cataclysmic conflict that would, they believed, presage the messianic age.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The quarter-acre <b>scale model</b>, adjacent to the Shrine of the Book, represents Jerusalem as it was on the eve of the Great Revolt against Rome (AD 66). For 40 years, the huge, intricate reconstruction was a popular attraction in its original home, on the grounds of West Jerusalem\'s Holyland Hotel. It moved to the Israel Museum in 2006, when the hotel was overtaken by high-end property development.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When the model was originally built in the mid-1960s, its designer, the late Professor Michael Avi-Yonah, relied on considerable data gleaned from Roman-period historians, important Jewish texts, and even the New Testament. Later archaeological excavations have sometimes confirmed and sometimes contradicted his inspired guesswork, and the model has been updated occasionally to incorporate new knowledge. The available audioguide is a worthwhile asset in deciphering the site.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The open-air <b>Art Garden</b> was designed against a Judean Hills cityscape by the landscape architect Isamu Noguchi. Crunch over the gravel amid works by Daumier, Rodin, Moore, and Picasso.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once a year, when the <b>youth wing</b> is not substituting for closed exhibition wings, it mounts a new exhibition, delightfully interactive and often adult-friendly, designed to encourage children to appreciate the arts and the world around them, or be creative in a crafts workshop. Parents with restless kids will also be grateful for the outdoor play areas. A cafeteria (only one at this writing, and closed Saturday) and a museum store complete the site. www.imj.org.il. COST: NIS 42 (includes audioguide); half price for return visit within one month (keep your ticket).

The Assyrians invaded Judah in 701 BC, 20 years after they had destroyed its sister-kingdom of Israel to the north. According to the Bible, King Hezekiah attempted to protect Jerusalem\'s precious water supply in order to meet the imminent assault on the capital. He instructed his men to \"stop the water of the springs that were outside the city\" (II Chronicles 32). Racing against time, they dug a water tunnel a third of a mile long through solid rock, one team starting from the Gihon Spring and the other from a new inner-city reservoir. Miraculously, considering the serpentine course of the tunnel, the two teams met in the middle. The chisel marks, the ancient plaster, and the zigzags near the halfway point as each team sought the other by sound bear witness to the remarkable project. With the water now diverted into the city, the original opening of the spring was blocked to deny the enemy access. Hezekiah, says the same biblical chapter, \"closed the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon and directed them down to the west side of the city of David.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the 19th century, an inscription in ancient Hebrew (since removed) was found chiseled into the tunnel wall near the exit. \"This is the story of the boring through...\" it began, echoing the biblical account; \"the tunnelers hewed the rock, each man toward his fellow...And the water flowed from the spring toward the reservoir for 1,200 cubits [577 yards].\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you don\'t want to get your feet wet, you can still view the spring and marvel at the ingenuity of the ancient engineers, and then exit the site through a narrow but dry Canaanite tunnel. If you do decide to enter the spring and wade the long narrow tunnel, you can easily imagine the dull digging of the ancient teams, and relive the electrifying moment when the last chunk of rock was removed, the water flowed, and the city saved. The tunnel emerges in the Pool of Siloam, mentioned in the New Testament as the place where a blind man had his sight restored (John 9). What you see today is a modest Byzantine construction; but the current exit takes you over the large flagstones of a Second Temple street to the original, impressive 1st-century reservoir, only recently discovered and partially exposed. www.cityofdavid.org.il. COST: NIS 23, add NIS 5 for 3D film, guided tour NIS 50 (includes admission and film). OPEN: Apr.-Sept., Sun.-Thurs. 8-7, Fri. and Jewish holiday eves 8-3; Oct.-Mar., Sun.-Thurs. 8-5, Fri. and Jewish holiday eves 8-1, last entrance 2 hrs before closing. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Machaneh Yehuda</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This block-long alley and a parallel wider street are filled with the brilliant colors of the city\'s best-quality and lowest-price fruit, vegetables, cheeses, confection stalls, falafel stands, fresh fish, and poultry. It\'s fun to elbow your way through anytime, but it\'s riotously busy on Thursday and Friday in particular, when Jewish Jerusalem shops for the Sabbath, and the hawkers\' cries get more passionate as closing time approaches. Look for the excellent coffee shop called \"Mizrachi / Hakol le\'ofeh Ve\'gam Kafeh\" (sign in Hebrew only), on Shazif Street, third lane on the left as you enter from the Agrippas Street end. The market links Jaffa Street and Agrippas Street, parallel to and just a five-minute walk up from King George Street (as you go west). Most of the downtown bus lines stop on Jaffa Street, or at least on King George, and there is paid parking close to the market.

It\'s an emotional, multilayered journey. As you walk chronologically through the apartheid years and eventually reach the country\'s first steps to freedom, with democratic elections in 1994, you experience a taste of the pain and suffering with which so many South Africans had to live.

The find reinforced the discovery of a skull of an <i>Australopithecus</i> child, the \"Taung Skull,\" by Prof. Raymond Dart in 1924, which was the first hominid ever found. At the time, Dart was ostracized for claiming the skull belonged to an early human ancestor. Scientists in Europe and the United States simply didn\'t believe that humanity could have originated in Africa. Today, few disagree with this theory. Another important find was the discovery in the 1990s of \"Little Foot,\" a near-complete skeleton of an Australopithecus, embedded in rock deep inside the caves.

Visiting Glacier Bay is like stepping back into the Little Ice Age—it\'s one of the few places in the world where you can approach such a variety of massive tidewater glaciers. Sounding like cannon fire, bergs the size of 10-story office buildings come crashing from the \"snout\" of a glacier, each cannon blast signifying another step in the glacier\'s steady retreat. The calving iceberg sends tons of water and spray skyward, propelling mini-tidal waves outward from the point of impact. <b>Johns Hopkins Glacier</b> calves so often and with such volume that large cruise ships can seldom come within 2 mi of its face.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Glacier Bay is a still-forming body of water fed by the runoff of the ice fields, glaciers, and mountains that surround it. In the mid-18th century, ice floes so covered the bay that Captain James Cook and then Captain George Vancouver sailed by and didn\'t even know it. At the time of Vancouver\'s sailing in 1794, the bay was still hidden behind and beneath a vast glacial wall of ice, which was more than 20 mi across and in places more than 4,000 feet in depth. It extended more than 100 mi north to its origins in the St. Elias Mountain Range, the world\'s tallest coastal mountains. Since then, the face of the glacial ice has melted and retreated with amazing speed, exposing 65 mi of fjords, islands, and inlets.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1879, about a century after Vancouver\'s sail-by, one of the earliest white visitors to what is now Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve came calling. The ever-curious naturalist John Muir, who would become one of the region\'s earliest proponents, was drawn by the flora and fauna that had followed in the wake of glacial withdrawals; he was also fascinated by the vast ice rivers that descended from the mountains to tidewater. Today the naturalist\'s namesake glacier, like others in the park, continues to retreat dramatically: The Muir Glacier\'s terminus is now scores of miles farther up the bay from the small cabin he built at its face during his time there.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Glacier Bay is a marvelous laboratory for naturalists of all persuasions. Glaciologists, of course, can have a field day. Animal lovers can hope to see the rare glacial \"blue\" bears of the area, a variation of the black bear, which is here along with the brown bear; whales feasting on krill; mountain goats in late spring and early summer; and seals on floating icebergs. Birders can look for the more than 200 species that have already been spotted in the park, and if you\'re lucky, you may witness two bald eagles engaging in aerobatics.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A remarkable panorama of plants unfolds from the head of the bay, which is just emerging from the ice, to the mouth, which has been ice-free for more than 200 years. In between, the primitive plants—algae, lichens, and mosses—that are the first to take hold of the bare, wet ground give way to more complex species: flowering plants such as the magenta dwarf fireweed and the creamy dryas, which in turn merge with willows, alders, and cottonwood. As the living plants mature and die, they enrich the soil and prepare it for new species to follow. The climax of the plant community is the lush spruce-and-hemlock rain forest, rich in life and blanketing the land around <b>Bartlett Cove.</b>www.nps.gov/glba. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sitka National Historical Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The main building at this park houses a small museum with fascinating historical exhibits and photos of Tlingit native culture. Highlights include a brass peace hat given to the Sitka Kiksádi by Russian traders in the early 1800s and a Chilkat robe. Head to the theater to watch a video about Russian-Tlingit conflict in the 19th century. Also here is the <b>Southeast Alaska Indian Cultural Center,</b> where native artisans demonstrate silversmithing, weaving, wood carving, and basketry. Don\'t be afraid to strike up a conversation; the artisans are happy to talk about their work and Tlingit cultural traditions. At the far end of the building are seven totems (some more than a century old) that have been brought indoors to protect them from decay. Behind the center, a wide 1-mi path takes you through the forest and along the shore of Sitka Sound. Scattered along the way are some of the most skillfully carved native totem poles in Alaska. Keep going on the trail to see spawning salmon from the footbridge over Indian River. Park Service rangers lead themed walks in the summer, which focus on the Russian-Tlingit conflict, the area\'s natural history, and the park\'s totem poles. www.nps.gov/sitk. COST: $3.

There are a handful of facilities that allow you to commune with trained dolphins. In-water programs, where you actually swim with these intelligent creatures, are extremely popular and require advance reservations. All programs begin with a course on dolphin physiology and behavior. Afterward you learn a few important dos and don\'ts. Finally, you take the plunge, quite literally.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For the in-water programs, the dolphins swim all around you. If you lie on your back with your feet out, they use their snouts to push you around. You can also grab a dorsal fin for an exciting ride. The in-water encounter lasts 10-25 minutes, depending on the program. The entire experience takes about two hours. The best time to go is when it\'s warm, from March through December. You spend a lot of time in and out of the water, and you can feel your teeth chattering on a chilly day. There\'s no need to get completely wet, however. Waterside programs let you feed, shake hands, and do tricks with dolphins from a submerged platform. These are great for people who aren\'t strong swimmers or for youngsters who don\'t meet a facility\'s minimum age requirements for in-water programs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Dolphin Connection</b>.

Bars and restaurants around the island claim that he ate or drank there (except Bagatelle, where the sign reads Hemingway never liked this place).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hemingway came to Key West in 1928 at the urging of writer John dos Passos and rented a house with wife number two, Pauline Pfeiffer. They spent winters in the Keys and summers in Europe and Wyoming, occasionally taking African safaris. Along the way they had two sons, Patrick and Gregory. In 1931, Pauline\'s wealthy uncle Gus gave the couple the house at 907 Whitehead Street. Now known as the Ernest Hemingway Home &amp; Museum, it\'s Key West\'s number-one tourist attraction. Renovations included the addition of a pool and a tropical garden with peacocks.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1935, when the visitor bureau included the house in a tourist brochure, Hemingway promptly built the high brick wall that surrounds it today. He wrote of the visitor bureau\'s offense in a 1935 essay for <i>Esquire,</i> saying,\"The house at present occupied by your correspondent is listed as number eighteen in a compilation of the forty-eight things for a tourist to see in Key West. So there will be no difficulty in a tourist finding it or any other of the sights of the city, a map has been prepared by the local F.E.R.A. authorities to be presented to each arriving visitor... This is all very flattering to the easily bloated ego of your correspondent but very hard on production.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">During his time in Key West, Hemingway penned some of his most important works, including <i>A Farewell to Arms, To Have and Have Not, Green Hills of Africa,</i> and <i>Death in the Afternoon.</i> His rigorous schedule consisted of writing almost every morning in his 2nd-story studio above the pool, then promptly descending the stairs at midday. By afternoon and evening he was ready for drinking, fishing, swimming, boxing, and hanging around with the boys.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One close friend was Joe Russell, a craggy fisherman and owner of the rugged bar Sloppy Joe\'s, originally at 428 Greene St. but now at 201 Duval St. Russell was the only one in town who would cash Hemingway\'s $1,000 royalty check. Russell and Charles Thompson introduced Hemingway to deep-sea fishing, which became fodder for his writing. Another of Hemingway\'s loves was boxing. He set up a ring in his yard and paid local fighters to box with him, and he refereed matches at Blue Heaven, then a saloon at 729 Thomas St.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hemingway honed his macho image dressed in cutoffs and old shirts and took on the name Papa. In turn, he gave his friends new names and used them as characters in his stories. Joe Russell became Freddy, captain of the <i>Queen Conch</i> charter boat in <i>To Have and Have Not.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hemingway stayed in Key West for 11 years before leaving Pauline for wife number three. Pauline and the boys stayed on in the house, which sold in 1951 for $80,000, 10 times its original cost.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">—Jim and Cynthia Tunstall</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The underwater treasure encompasses 78 square mi of coral reefs, sea-grass beds, and mangrove swamps. Its reefs contain 40 of the 52 species of coral in the Atlantic Reef System and nearly 600 varieties of fish, from the colorful stoplight parrot fish to the demure cocoa damselfish. The park\'s visitor center has a large floor-to-ceiling fish tank surrounded by smaller ones, so you can get a closer look at many of the underwater creatures. When you want to head out to sea, a concessionaire rents canoes and powerboats, as well as snorkeling and diving equipment. You can also sign up for snorkeling and diving trips ($29 and $60, respectively) and glass-bottom-boat rides to the reef ($24). One of the most popular excursions is the snorkeling trip to see Christ of the Deep, the 2-ton underwater statue of Jesus at Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary.

The 524-acre park here sprawls across both sides of the highway, giving it 2½ mi of fabulous sandy coastline—three beaches in all—on both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. It\'s regularly declared the best beach in Florida, and you\'ll be hard pressed to argue. The sand is baby-powder soft, and the aqua water is warm, clear, and shallow. With their mild currents, the beaches are great for swimming, even with small fry. The snorkeling isn\'t bad, either; there\'s underwater life (soft coral, queen conchs, random little fish) just a few hundred feet offshore. Although swimming, kayaking, fishing, and boating are the main reasons to visit, you shouldn\'t miss biking along the 3½ mi of flat roads or hiking the Silver Palm Trail, with rare West Indian plants and several species found nowhere else in the nation. Along the way you\'ll be treated to a variety of butterflies. Seasonal ranger-led nature programs take place or depart from the Sand and Sea Nature Center. There are rental cabins, a campground, snack bar, gift shop, 19-slip marina, nature center, and facilities for renting kayaks and arranging snorkeling tours.

Bars and restaurants around the island claim that he ate or drank there, and though he may not have been at all of them, his larger-than-life image continues to grow.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hemingway came to Key West in 1928 at the urging of writer John dos Passos and rented a house with wife number two, Pauline Pfeiffer. They spent winters in the Keys and summers in Europe and Wyoming, occasionally taking African safaris. Along the way they had two sons, Patrick and Gregory. In 1931 Pauline\'s wealthy uncle Gus gave the couple the house at 907 Whitehead Street. Now known as the Ernest Hemingway Home &amp; Museum, it\'s Key West\'s number one tourist attraction. Renovations included the addition of a pool and a tropical garden with peacocks.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1935, when the visitor bureau included the house in a tourist brochure, Hemingway promptly built the high brick wall that surrounds it today. He wrote of the visitor bureau\'s offense in a 1935 essay for <i>Esquire,</i> saying, \"The house at present occupied by your correspondent is listed as number eighteen in a compilation of the forty-eight things for a tourist to see in Key West. So there will be no difficulty in a tourist finding it or any other of the sights of the city, a map has been prepared by the local F.E.R.A. authorities to be presented to each arriving visitor.. This is all very flattering to the easily bloated ego of your correspondent but very hard on production.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">During his time in Key West, Hemingway penned some of his most important works, including <i>A Farewell to Arms, To Have and Have Not, Green Hills of Africa,</i> and <i>Death in the Afternoon.</i> His rigorous schedule consisted of writing almost every morning in his second-story studio above the pool, then promptly descending the stairs at midday. By afternoon and evening he was ready for drinking, fishing, swimming, boxing, and hanging around with the boys.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One close friend was Joe Russell, a craggy fisherman and owner of the rugged bar Sloppy Joe\'s, originally at 428 Greene Street but now at 201 Duval Street. Russell was the only one in town who would cash Hemingway\'s $1,000 royalty check. Russell and Charles Thompson introduced Hemmingway to deep-sea fishing, which became fodder for his writing. Another of Hemingway\'s loves was boxing. He set up a ring in his yard and paid local fighters to box with him, and he refereed matches at Blue Heaven, then a saloon but now a restaurant, at 729 Thomas Street.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hemingway honed his macho image dressed in cutoffs and old shirts and took on the name Papa. In turn, he gave his friends new names and used them as characters in his stories. Joe Russell became Freddy, captain of the <i>Queen Conch</i> charter boat in <i>To Have and Have Not.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hemingway stayed in Key West for 11 years before leaving Pauline for wife number three. Pauline and the boys stayed on in the house, which sold in 1951 for $80,000, 10 times its original cost.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Modern jerk originated in the 1930s along Boston Beach, east of Port Antonio. Here, the first wayside stands sprang up on the side of the road, offering fiery jerk served in a casual atmosphere. Today, jerk stands are everywhere on the island, but many aficionados still return to Boston Beach for the \"real thing.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The historic origins of jerk are unknown (some say the Maroons brought the practice from Africa; others say the cooking style came to the island with the Caribs and the Arawaks). The practice of jerking meat was first recorded in 1698 by a French priest, who wrote of a jerk pit made with four forked sticks with crosspieces covered with a grill made of sticks. On the grill was placed a whole pig, stuffed with lime juice, salt, pimento, and spices that helped preserve the meat in the hot climate.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Today, jerk is still cooked in a pit that contains a fire made from pimento wood. The meat, which is primarily pork but can also be chicken, goat, or fish, is marinated with jerk sauce. Every cook has his own favorite recipe, but most include allspice (pimento) berries, cloves, garlic, onion, ginger, cinnamon, thyme, and peppers. Commercial jerk sauces are also available. Once the jerk is cooked to perfection, it\'s served up with side dishes such as breadfruit, rice and peas, and a bread called festival.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">History and Culture</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Some of the island\'s earliest residents were the Arawak Indians, who arrived from South America around 650 AD, named the island Xaymaca or \"land of wood and water.\" Centuries later, the Arawaks welcomed Christopher Columbus on his second voyage to the New World. Later when the Spanish arrived, the peaceful inhabitants were executed or taken as slaves.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Spanish maintained control of the island until 1655 when the English arrived. Soon, slavery increased as sugar became a booming industry. In 1834, slavery was abolished, but the sugar as well as banana industries continued. Jamaica\'s plantation owners looked for another source of labor. From 1838 to 1917, over 30,000 Indians immigrated here, followed by about 5,000 Asians as well as immigrants from the Middle East, primarily what is now Lebanon.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the early 1900s, the boats that took the banana crop off the island began returning with travelers. By 1960, the tourism industry had become Jamaica\'s most important form of income. In 1962, Jamaica became an independent nation.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although 95% of the population traces its bloodlines to Africa, Jamaica is a stockpot of cultures, including those of other Caribbean islands, Great Britain, the Middle East, India, China, Germany, Portugal, and South America. The third-largest island in the Caribbean (after Cuba and Hispaniola), Jamaica enjoys a considerable self-sufficiency based on tourism, agriculture, and mining.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The best way to enjoy the falls is to climb the slippery steps: don a swimsuit, take the hand of the person ahead of you, and trust that the chain of hands and bodies leads to an experienced guide. The leaders of the climbs are personable fellows who reel off bits of local lore while telling you where to step; you can hire a guide\'s service for a tip of a few dollars. After the climb, you exit through a crowded market, another reminder that this is one of Jamaica\'s top tourist attractions. If you can, try to schedule a visit on a day when no cruise ships are in port. COST: $15. OPEN: Daily 8:30-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Negril Beach</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Stretching for 7 mi (11 km), the long, white-sand beach in Negril is arguably Jamaica\'s finest. It starts with the white sands of Bloody Bay north of town and continues along Long Bay all the way to the cliffs on the southern edge of town. Some stretches remain undeveloped, but these are increasingly few. Along the main stretch of beach, the sand is public to the high-water mark, so a nonstop line of visitors and vendors parade from end to end. The walk is sprinkled with many good beach bars and open-air restaurants, some of which charge a small fee to use their beach facilities. Bloody Bay is lined with large all-inclusive resorts, and these sections are mostly private. Jamaica\'s best-known nude beach, at Hedonism II, is always among the busiest; only resort guests or day-pass holders may sun here. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It\'s easy to find a good steak house, and you would be sorely missing out by skipping a taste.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Night View</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The nighttime neon lights reflecting off the quiet ocean oppostie the black of the mountains make Kobe famous as a city for romantic moments. Seen from Harborland, the Ferris wheel and distant Akashi bridge alternate colors, adding to Kobe\'s nighttime magic.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Luminarie</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For two weeks before Christmas, millions of lights arch across Kobe\'s streets, forming glittering tunnels. The Japanese tourists are as much of an attraction as the lights; hordes block the streets raising their <i>keitai</i> (cell phones) to snap pictures. This event began as a commemoration of the 1995 Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake, and now attracts approximately 5 million visitors each year.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">East Meets West</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When the port opened to international trade in 1868, Western fashion, cuisine, technology, and entertainment began to filter into the country. Jazz, international dining, and a larger than normal proportion of <i>gaijin</i> (foreigners) are lasting legacies of Kobe\'s history.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nada no Sake</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The sake breweries of Nada, a district in western Kobe, use the high-quality ingredients of <i>miyamizu</i> (mineral-rich water) and a higher-quality rice called Yamada Nishiki, grown near Mt. Rokko, especially for sake brewing. A large number of sake museums and breweries are in Nada, many offering free tastings and gift shops.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Best in a Day or Two</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A stroll around the Kitano area punctuated by a café stop and a great dinner is time well spent. You can see Kobe\'s main sights in a one-day excursion from Osaka or Kyoto, including a stop on your way down the San-yo Coast. With a second day in Kobe you can make a side trip to Rokko-san and Arima Onsen.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 1 Day</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A good place to start your visit to Kobe is the <b>Kobe City Museum</b>, where you can take in the history of the town, including memorabilia from the heyday of the old foreign settlement. To get to the museum, walk south down Flower Road from San-no-miya Station, past the Flower Clock and City Hall, to Higashi-Yuenchi Koen. Walk through the park to the Kobe Minato post office, across the street on the west side. Walk east on the road in front of the post office toward the Oriental Hotel. Turn left at the corner in front of the hotel; the museum is in the old Bank of Tokyo building, at the end of the block.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From here, continue on toward the water and stop into Meriken Park and the <b>Kobe Maritime Museum</b>, with its exhibits of ships and all things nautical. Return to San-no-miya Station, browsing through <b>Nankin-machi</b> (Chinatown) and the Moto-machi and San-no-miya shopping arcades if time permits. Once back at San-no-miya Station, begin your tour of the northern district by crossing the street that runs along the tracks and turning left at the first main intersection to see the classic outline of the orange torii at <b>Ikuta Jinja</b>. The road that runs up the right side of the shrine leads up the slope to Nakayamate-dori. Cross the avenue and continue up the slope. Turn right at the corner of Yamamoto-dori, a road lined with high-fashion boutiques and restaurants. Turn left at Kitano-zaka, which leads to <b>Kitano-cho,</b> an area where Western traders and businessmen have lived since the late 19th century. Many of the older ijinkan have been turned into museums. Continue up the slope from Nakayamate-dori. At the first intersection after Yamamoto-dori (nicknamed Ijinkan-dori), just past Rin\'s Gallery, which is filled with boutiques of Japan\'s top designers, turn right and walk east to visit the 1907 <b>Eikoku-kan</b>.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Three ijinkan in the Kitano-ku area are publicly owned. <b>Rhein-no-Yakata</b>, opposite Eikoku-kan, has a German-style coffee shop inside. Near Kitano Tenman Jinja at the top of the hill is the <b>Kazami-dori-no-Yakata</b>, made famous on a national TV series some years ago. Continue back down the slope via Kitano-zaka toward San-no-miya Station and turn right on Yamamoto-dori. One ijinkan house not to miss is the 1869 <b>Choueke Yashiki</b>, full of interesting turn-of-the-20th-century items. Return to San-no-miya Station and walk to the <b>Portliner</b> platform, and take the automated train to the consumer diversions on <b>Port Island</b> (Poto Airando).</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 2 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you have a second day in Kobe, take a trip to the city\'s eastern districts. From JR San-no-miya, take a local train one stop to JR Nada Station. From here walk south for 10 minutes until you come to the HAT (Happy Active Town) district. The two main sights in HAT are the <b>Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake Memorial</b> and the nearby <b>Hyogo Prefectural Museum of Art</b>. With an early start, you\'d be able to see them both in the morning, and then enjoy a light lunch at the art museum\'s very good café. After lunch, head back to JR San-no-miya Station and change to the adjoining Hankyu San-no-miya Station. Here, catch a local train heading east to Hankyu Rokko Station. The journey over <b>Rokko-san</b> and descent into the resort town of <b>Arima Onsen</b> offers wonderful views. After a refreshing soak in the town\'s famous hot baths, the return trip to San-no-miya should see you back in the center of town just in time for a hearty dinner of Kobe beef.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Since then, it has earned a reputation as the finest bear-viewing locale in North America, and likely the world, the standard by which all others are measured. The main focus is <b>McNeil Falls,</b> where bears come to feed on chum salmon returning to spawn. During the peak of the chum run (July to mid-August) dozens of brown bears congregate at the falls. As many as 70 bears, including cubs, have been observed along the river in a single day and more than 100 bears have been identified within a single season. It\'s not only the number of bears that makes McNeil special; over the years, several bears have become highly accustomed to a human presence. They will play, eat, nap, and nurse cubs within 15 to 20 feet of the falls viewing pad—sometimes closer. Do not think the bears are tame; they are still wild animals and the sanctuary staff makes sure that visitors behave in a nonthreatening, nonintrusive way.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">No more than 10 people a day, always accompanied by one or two state biologists, are allowed to visit bear-viewing sites from June 7 through August 25. Because demand is so high, an annual drawing is held in mid-March to determine permit winners. Applications must be received by March 1 to be eligible. Nearly all visitors fly into McNeil Sanctuary on floatplanes. Most arrange for air-taxi flights out of Homer, on the Kenai Peninsula. Once you are in the sanctuary, all travel is on foot. www.adfg.state.ak.us. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

King Sigismund the Old brought artists and craftsmen from Italy to create his castle, and despite baroque reconstruction after another fire in the late 16th century, several parts of the Renaissance castle remain, including the beautiful arcaded courtyard. After the transfer of the capital to Warsaw at the beginning of the 17th century, the castle was stripped of its fine furnishings, and later in the century it was devastated by the Swedish wars. In 1905, a voluntary Polish society purchased the castle from the Austrian authorities and began restoration. It narrowly escaped destruction in 1945, when the Nazis almost demolished it as a parting shot. Today you can visit the royal chambers, furnished in the style of the 16th and 17th centuries and hung with the 16th-century Arras-style tapestries from the Low Countries. Counted among the most valuable treasures of the Polish people, the tapestries were evacuated to Canada by Jan Polkowski (who had been appointed their guardian) during World War II in order to protect them against the invaders, and returned to Poland in 1961. The Royal Treasury on the ground floor contains a somewhat depleted collection of Polish crown jewels; the most fascinating item displayed here is the <i>Szczerbiec,</i> the jagged sword used from the early 14th century onward at the coronation of Polish kings. The Royal Armory houses a collection of Polish and Eastern arms and armor. The west wing holds an imposing collection of Turkish embroidered tents.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For many Poles, the castle\'s importance extends beyond its history. Hindu esoteric thinkers claim it is one of the world\'s mystic energy centers, a <i>chakhra.</i> Some believers—and there have been many over the last few decades—think that by rubbing up against the castle wall in the courtyard they will absorb vital energy.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Every Polish child knows the legend of the fire-breathing dragon that once terrorized local residents from his <b>Smocza Jama</b> (Dragon\'s Den), a cave at the foot of Wawel Hill. Follow the signs to the ticket office opposite the castle, in the direction of the river. The dragon threatened to destroy the town unless he was fed a damsel a week. The king promised half his kingdom and his daughter\'s hand in marriage to any man who could slay the dragon. The usual quota of knights tried and failed. But finally a crafty cobbler named Skuba tricked the dragon into eating a lambskin filled with salt and sulfur. The dragon went wild with thirst, rushed into the Vistula River, and drank until it exploded. The Dragon\'s Den is still there, however, and in warmer months smoke and flame belch out of it every 15 minutes to thrill young visitors. A bronze statue of the dragon itself stands guard at the entrance. The den is open May-September, Monday-Thursday and weekends 10-3; admission is zl 5. To reach the castle, go to the end of Grodzka or Kanonicza streets, and then walk up Wawel Hill.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The number of visitors to the royal chambers is limited, and entry tickets are timed; therefore, you should always try to book your tickets in advance to avoid disappointment. Phone to make the reservation, and then collect your tickets from the Tourist Service Office (BOT) located opposite the Sigismund Chapel (the one with the golden dome).

It even has the same plague of pigeons, although legend tells us the ones here are no ordinary birds: they are allegedly the spirits of the knights of Duke Henry IV Probus, who in the 13th century were cursed and turned into birds. This great square was not always so spacious. In an earlier period it contained—in addition to the present buildings—a Gothic town hall, a Renaissance granary, a large weighing house, a foundry, a pillory, and hundreds of traders\' stalls. A few flower sellers under colorful umbrellas and some portable souvenir stalls are all that remain of this bustling commercial activity. Above all, Rynek is Kraków\'s largest outdoor café, from spring through autumn, with more than 20 cafés scattered around the perimeter of the square.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A pageant of history has passed through this square. From 1320 on, Polish kings came here on the day after their coronation to meet the city\'s burghers and receive homage and tribute in the name of all the towns of Poland. Albert Hohenzollern, the grand master of the Teutonic Knights, came here in 1525 to pay homage to Sigismund the Old, King of Poland. And in 1794 Tadeusz Kosciuszko took a solemn vow to overthrow czarist Russia here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The square is surrounded by many historic buildings. The <b>Dom pod Jeleniami</b> (House at the Sign of the Stag), at No. 36, was once an inn where both Goethe and Czar Nicholas I found shelter. At No. 45 is the <b>Dom pod Orlem</b> (House at the Sign of the Eagle), where Tadeusz Kosciuszko lived as a young officer in 1777; a little farther down the square, at No. 6, is the <b>Szara Kamienica</b> (Gray House), which he made his staff headquarters in 1794. In the house at No. 9, the young Polish noblewoman Maryna Mniszchówna married the False Dymitri, the pretender to the Russian throne, in 1605. (These events are portrayed in Pushkin\'s play <i>Boris Godunov</i> and in Mussorgsky\'s operatic adaptation of it.) At No. 16 is the <b>14th-century house</b> of the Wierzynek merchant family. In 1364, during a \"summit\" meeting attended by the Holy Roman Emperor, one of the Wierzyneks gave an elaborate feast for the visiting royal dignitaries; today the house is a restaurant.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the southwest corner of Rynek Square, the <b>Wieza Ratuszowa</b> is all that remains of the 16th-century town hall, which was demolished in the early 19th century. The tower houses a branch of the Muzeum Historyczne Miasta Krakowa (Kraków History Museum) and affords a panoramic view of the old city. Although the museum and tower are closed during the winter, it\'s possible to organize a group visit. Rynek Glówny, Stare Miasto. tel. 012/422-15-04. COST: zl 4.

Walk a little way down the <b>Path of Philosophy</b> before taking a taxi to <b>Kiyomizu-dera,</b> a vast wooden temple built on a hillside.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Next, walk through <b>Maruyama Koen</b> to <b>Chion-in,</b> taking special notice of the awesome San-mon at its entrance. From here take a taxi to the <b>Kyoto Craft Center</b> to browse through the traditional and regional crafts. You may also want to take a break for lunch here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Another taxi ride takes you to central Kyoto and <b>Nijo-jo,</b> a grandiose statement of Tokugawa military might. Now make tracks for western Kyoto, where you should have time for abbreviated visits to <b>Kinkaku-ji,</b> built in 1393, and <b>Ryoan-ji,</b> for its soul-searching garden. You can travel between the two on Bus 12. Because you\'re here so briefly, don\'t miss an all-out kaiseki dinner for a magical end to the day.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Give your first day to visiting the attractions in eastern Kyoto described above, but after <b>Ginkaku-ji</b> and the <b>Path of Philosophy,</b> slip in <b>Nanzen-ji,</b> the <b>Heian Jingu,</b> and <b>Sanjusangen-do</b> before going on to <b>Kiyomizu-dera.</b> On your second day spend the morning in central Kyoto at the <b>Imperial Palace</b> and <b>Nijo-jo.</b> In the afternoon cover western Kyoto and include <b>Kinkaku-ji,</b><b>Ryoan-ji,</b><b>Ninna-ji,</b> and <b>Myoshin-ji.</b> The morning of the third day take the Hankyu Railway Line from Kyoto\'s Hankyu Kawara-machi Station to Katsura Station and walk 15 minutes to get to <b>Katsura Rikyu</b> (having obtained your permit to do so the morning before).

You can, however, pack up a few <i>omiyage</i> (mementos)—the take-home gifts for which this city is famous. The ancient craftsmen of Kyoto served the imperial court for more than 1,000 years, and the prefix <i>kyo-</i> before a craft is synonymous with fine craftsmanship. The wares you can find in Kyoto are, for their superb artistry and refinement, among the world\'s finest.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><i>Kyo-ningyo,</i> exquisite display dolls, have been made in Kyoto since the 9th century. Constructed of wood coated with white shell paste and clothed in elaborate, miniature patterned-silk brocades, Kyoto dolls are considered the finest in Japan. Kyoto is also known for fine ceramic dolls and <i>Kyo-gangu,</i> its local varieties of folk toys.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><i>Kyo-sensu</i> are embellished folding fans used as accoutrements in No theater, tea ceremonies, and Japanese dance. They also have a practical use—to keep you cool. Unlike other Japanese crafts, which have their origin in Tang dynasty China, the folding fan originated in Kyoto.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><i>Kyo-shikki</i> refers to Kyoto lacquerware, which also has its roots in the 9th century. The making of lacquerware, adopted from the Chinese, is a delicate process requiring patience and skill. Finished lacquerware products range from furniture to spoons and bowls, which are carved from cypress, cedar, or horse-chestnut wood. These pieces have a brilliant luster; some designs are decorated with gold leaf and inlaid mother-of-pearl.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><i>Kyo-yaki</i> is the general term applied to ceramics made in local kilns; the most popular ware is from Kyoto\'s Kiyomizu district. Often colorfully hand-painted in blue, red, and green on white, these elegantly shaped teacups, bowls, and vases are thrown on potters\' wheels located in the Kiyomizu district and in Kiyomizu-danchi in Yamashina. Streets leading up to Kiyomizu-dera—Chawan-zaka, Sannen-zaka, and Ninen-zaka—are sprinkled with kyo-yaki shops.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><i>Kyo-yuzen</i> is a paste-resist silk-dyeing technique developed by 17th-century dyer Yuzen Miyazaki. Fantastic designs are created on plain white silk pieces through the process of either <i>tegaki yuzen</i> (hand-painting) or <i>kata yuzen</i> (stenciling).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><i>Nishijin-ori</i> is the weaving of silk. <i>Nishijin</i> refers to a Kyoto district producing the best silk textiles in all of Japan, which are used to make kimonos. Walk along the narrow backstreets of Nishijin and listen to the persistently rhythmic looms.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ryokan Etiquette</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Upon entering, take off your shoes, as you would do in a Japanese household, and put on the slippers that are provided in the entryway. A maid, after bowing to welcome you, will escort you to your room, which will have <i>tatami</i> (straw mats) on the floor and will probably be partitioned off with <i>shoji</i> (sliding paper-paneled walls). Remove your slippers before entering your room; you should not step on the tatami with either shoes or slippers. The room will have little furniture or decoration—perhaps one small low table and cushions on the tatami, with a long, simple scroll on the wall. Often the rooms overlook a garden.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Plan to arrive in the late afternoon, as is the custom. After relaxing with a cup of green tea, have a long, hot bath. In ryokan with thermal pools, you can take to the waters anytime, although the doors to the pool are usually locked from 11 PM to 6 AM. In ryokan without thermal baths or private baths in guest rooms, guests must stagger visits to the one or two public baths. Typically the maid will ask what time you would like your bath and fit you into a schedule. In Japanese baths, washing and soaking are separate functions: wash and rinse off entirely, and then get in the tub. Be sure to keep all soap out of the tub. Because other guests will be using the same bathwater after you, it is important to observe this custom. After your bath, change into a <i>yukata,</i> a simple cotton kimono, provided in your room. Don\'t worry about walking around in what is essentially a robe—all other guests will be doing the same.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Dinner, included in the price, is served in your room at smaller and more personal ryokan; at larger ryokan, especially the newer ones, meals will be in the dining room. After you are finished, a maid will discreetly come in, clear away the dishes, and lay out your futon. In Japan <i>futon</i> means bedding, and this consists of a thin cotton mattress and a heavy, thick comforter. In summer the comforter is replaced with a thinner quilt. The small, hard pillow is filled with grain. The less expensive ryokan (under ¥7,000 for one) have become slightly lackadaisical in changing the sheet cover over the quilt with each new guest; feel free to complain (in as inoffensive a way as possible, of course, so as not to shame the proprietor). In the morning a maid will gently wake you, clear away the futon, and bring in your Japanese-style breakfast. If you are not fond of Japanese breakfasts, which often consist of fish, pickled vegetables, and rice, the staff will usually be able to rustle up some coffee and toast.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Because most ryokan staffs are small and dedicated, it is important to be considerate and understanding of their somewhat rigid schedules. Guests are expected to arrive in the late afternoon and eat around 6. Usually the doors to the inn are locked at 10, so plan for early evenings. Breakfast is served around 8, and checkout is at 10.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bear in mind that not all inns are willing to accept foreign guests because of language and cultural barriers. Also, top-level ryokan expect even new Japanese guests to have introductions and references from a respected client of the inn, which means that you, too, might need an introduction from a Japanese for very top-level ryokan. On the other side of this issue, inns that do accept foreigners without introduction sometimes treat them as cash cows, which means giving you cursory service and a lesser room. When you reserve a room, try to have a Japanese make the call for you, or you can do it yourself if you know Japanese; this will convey the idea that you understand the customs of staying in a traditional inn.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Supported in part by 139 pillars, the temple juts out over the valley. Finding the courage to set out on a daring, new adventure is likened to \"taking a leap from the veranda of Kiyomizu.\" The cypress-shingle roof harmonizes with the cryptomeria-covered hills, and below is the slender Sound of Feathers waterfall, believed to be the original source of <i>kiyomizu,</i> or pure water, which is drunk to prevent illness, using long-handled cups. The valley stroll garden is meant to suggest the southern paradise of the bodhisattva Kannon, the 11-faced goddess of mercy.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Built in 788, the original temple, which today belongs to the Hosso sect, predates Kyoto by six years. Although Kiyomizu-dera honors the popular Kannon, to whom women pray for an easy childbirth, it has become over time a sort of everyman\'s temple. You\'ll see evidence of this throughout the grounds, from the stacked rows of little Jizo Bosatsu statues (representing the god of travel and children) to the many <i>koma-inu</i> (mythical guard dogs), donated by grateful patrons, marking the pathways.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The current structure dates from 1633; the militant monks of Hiei-zan destroyed the original temple during one of their periodic bloody purges. On the south side is a brilliant vermilion, three-tier pagoda decorated with Chinese influences in the forms of colorful flowers, esoteric Buddhist symbols, and ornate metalwork above the grand wooden gate. On the north side of the main hall is a small shrine called <b>Jishu-jinja,</b> dedicated to Okuni Nushi-no-mikoto, a land-ruling deity also considered to be a powerful matchmaker. Many young people visit the shrine to seek help in finding their life partners. They try to walk between two stones placed 18 meters (59 feet) apart, with their eyes closed. It\'s said that love will materialize for anyone who can walk in a straight line between the two.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shops selling souvenirs, religious articles, and ceramics line Kiyomizu-zaka, the street leading to the temple. There are also tea shops where you can sample <i>yatsuhashi</i>—doughy, triangular sweets filled with cinnamon-flavor bean paste—a Kyoto specialty. From Kyoto Station take Bus 206 to the Kiyomizu-michi stop. From the Kawai Kanjiro Memorial House cross the major avenue, Gojo-dori, and walk up Higashi-oji-dori. The street to the right, Gojo-zaka, leads into Kiyomizu-zaka, which you\'ll take to the temple. November 1-10, the garden of the superior of the temple is open to the public. COST: ¥300. OPEN: Daily 6-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kinkaku-ji</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For a retirement home, the gold-sheathed Kinkaku-ji is pretty magnificent. Shogun Yoshimitsu Ashikaga (1358-1409) had it constructed in 1393 for the time when he would quit politics—the following year, in fact—to manage the affairs of state through the new shogun, his 10-year-old son. On Yoshimitsu\'s death, his son followed his father\'s wishes and converted the villa into a temple named Rokuon-ji. The structure sits, following the Shinden style of the Heian period, at the edge of the lake. Pillars support the three-story pavilion, which extends over the pond and is reflected in the calm waters. To underscore this statement of his prestige and power, the shogun had the ceiling of the third floor of the pavilion covered in gold leaf.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1950 a student monk with metaphysical aspirations torched Kinkaku-ji, burning it to the ground. (Yukio Mishima\'s book <i>Temple of the Golden Pavilion</i> is a fictional exploration of the mind of the student.) Kinkaku-ji was rebuilt in 1955 based on the original design, except that all three stories were covered with gold leaf, in accordance with the shogun\'s original intention, instead of only the third-floor ceiling.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Marveling at this pavilion, you might find it difficult to imagine the era in which Shogun Yoshimitsu Ashikaga lived out his golden years. The country was in turmoil, and Kyoto residents suffered severe famines and plagues—local death tolls sometimes reached 1,000 a day. The temple is a short walk from the Kinkaku-ji-mae bus stop. From Daisen-in the ride on Bus 12 takes about 10 minutes. COST: ¥400. OPEN: Daily 9-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hiei-zan and Enryaku-ji</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the observatory at the top of Hiei-zan a serpentine mountain path leads to Enryaku-ji (a half-hour walk), which remains a vital center of the Tendai sect of Buddhism. Today Enryaku-ji has three main precincts: the Eastern Precinct, where the main building in the complex, the Kompon Chu-do, stands; the Western Precinct; and the Yokawa district, a few miles north. At one time the complex consisted of 3,000 buildings and had its own standing army. These days, however, the monks are known as marathon monks—due to the extremely rigorous physical training that some still undergo—rather than their ancient appellation of military monks.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Enryaku-ji really began in 788. Emperor Kammu, the founding father of Kyoto, requested Priest Saicho (767-822) to establish a temple on Hiei-zan to protect the area. Hiei-zan was a natural barrier between the fledgling city and the northeastern Kin-mon (Devil\'s Gate), where devils were said to pass.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Unlike the older Nara sects that accepted a hierarchical society, Tendai espoused the belief that attaining Buddhahood was possible for anyone. The temple grew, and because police were not allowed on its mountaintop sanctuary, criminals flocked here, ostensibly to seek salvation. By the 11th century the temple had formed its own army to secure order on its estate. In time this army grew and became stronger than those of most other feudal lords, and the power of Enryaku-ji came to threaten Kyoto. No imperial army could manage a war without the support of Enryaku-ji, and when there was no war Enryaku-ji\'s armies would burn and slaughter monks of rival Buddhist sects, even destroying the Imperial Palace in 1177. Not until the 16th century was there a force strong enough to sustain an assault on the temple. With accusations that the monks had concubines and never read the sutras, Nobunaga Oda (1534-82), the general who helped unify Japan by ending more than a century of civil strife, attacked the monastery in 1571. In the battle many monks were killed, and most buildings were destroyed. Structures standing today were built in the 17th century.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Kompon Chu-do</b> in the Eastern Precinct dates from 1642 and has a stunning copper roof in the <i>irimoya-zukuri</i> layered style. Its dark, cavernous interior conveys the mysticism for which the Tendai sect is known. Giant pillars and a coffered ceiling shelter the central altar, which is surrounded by religious images and sacred objects. Worshipers kneel on a side higher than the shadowy area containing the altars, which allows them to come face-to-face with the deity. The ornate oil lanterns that hang before the altar represent the four stages of enlightenment.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Western Precinct is where Saicho founded his temple and where he is buried. An incense burner wafts smoke before his tomb, which lies in a small hollow. Cedar trees surround the main structures of Jodo-in, Ninai-do, and Shaka-do, the oldest building in the complex. Sometimes you can hear chanting or catch sight of a monk sweeping the paths or clattering up the stone steps in wooden geta.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Take Kyoto Line Bus 16, 17, or 18 up the main highway, Route 367, to the Yase Yuenchi bus stop, next to Yase Yuen Station. You can see the entrance to the cable car on your left. It departs every 30 minutes, and you can transfer to the ropeway at Hiei for the remaining ride to the summit, where an observatory affords panoramic views of the mountains and of Biwa-ko. www.hieizan.or.jp. COST: Enryaku-ji ¥800, Hiei-zan cable car ¥530, ropeway ¥310. OPEN: Enryaku-ji Mar.-Nov., daily 8:30-4:30; Dec.-Feb., daily 9-4.

Dominating central Kyoto with its towering walls and moat, the castle is an intrusion, both politically and artistically. The man who built the castle in 1603, Ieyasu Tokugawa, the founder of the shogunate, did so to emphasize that political power had been completely removed from the emperor and that he alone determined the destiny of Japan. Accordingly, Tokugawa built and decorated his castle with such ostentation as to make the populace cower in the face of his wealth and power.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ieyasu Tokugawa had risen to power through skillful political maneuvers and treachery. His military might was unassailable, and that\'s probably why his Kyoto castle had relatively modest exterior defenses. However, as he well knew, defense against treachery is never certain. The interior of the castle was built with that in mind. Each building had concealed rooms where bodyguards could maintain a watchful eye for potential assassins, and the corridors had built-in \"nightingale\" floors, so no one could walk in the building without making noise. Rooms were locked only from the inside; thus, no one from the outer rooms could gain access to the inner rooms without being admitted by someone within. The outer rooms were kept for visitors of low rank and were adorned with garish paintings that were meant to dazzle them. The inner rooms were for the important lords, whom the shogun would impress with the refined, tasteful paintings of the Kano school.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The opulence and grandeur of the castle were a snub to the emperor. They relegated the emperor and his palace to insignificance, and the Tokugawa family even appointed a governor to manage the emperor and the imperial family. The Tokugawa shoguns were rarely in Kyoto. Ieyasu stayed in the castle three times; the second shogun stayed twice, including the time in 1626 when Emperor Gomizuno-o was granted an audience. After that, for the next 224 years, no Tokugawa shogun visited Kyoto, and the castle started to fall into disrepair. Only when the Tokugawa shogunate was under pressure from a failing economy, and international pressure to open Japan to trade, did the 14th shogun, Iemochi Tokugawa (1846-66), come to Kyoto to confer with the emperor. The emperor told the shogun to rid Japan of foreigners, but Iemochi did not have the strength. As the shogunates power continued to wane, the 15th and last shogun, Yoshinobu Tokugawa (1837-1913), spent most of his time in Nijo-jo. Here he resigned, and the imperial decree was issued that abolished the shogunate after 264 years of rule. After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Nijo-jo became the Kyoto prefectural office until 1884; during that time it suffered from acts of vandalism. Since 1939 the castle has belonged to the city of Kyoto, and considerable restoration has taken place.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You enter the castle through the impressive <b>Kara-mon</b> (Chinese Gate). Notice that you must turn right and left at sharp angles to make this entrance designed to slow the advance of any attacker. From the Kara-mon, the carriageway leads to the <b>Ni-no-maru Goten</b> (Second Inner Palace), whose five buildings are divided into many chambers. The outer buildings were for visits by men of lowly rank, the inner ones (on higher levels) for those of higher rank. The most notable room, the <b>Ohiroma</b> (Great Hall), is easy to recognize. In the room costumed figures reconstruct the occasion when the last Tokugawa shogun returned the power of government to the emperor in the late 1860s. This spacious hall was where, in the early 17th century, the shogun would sit on a raised throne to greet important visitors seated below him. The sliding screens of this room have magnificent paintings of forest scenes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Also impressive is the garden, created by landscape designer Kobori Enshu shortly before Emperor Gomizuno-o\'s visit in 1626. Notice the crane-and-tortoise islands flanking the center island (called the Land of Paradise). The symbolic meaning is clear: strength and longevity. The garden was originally designed with no deciduous trees, for the shogun did not wish to be reminded of the transitory nature of life by autumn\'s falling leaves. To reach the castle, take the bus or subway to Nijo-jo-mae. COST: ¥600. OPEN: Daily 8:45-5; last entry at 4. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ginkaku-ji</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ginkaku-ji means \"Temple of the Silver Pavilion,\" but the temple is not silver; it was only intended to be. Shogun Yoshimasa Ashikaga (1435-90) commissioned this villa for his retirement and decreed it would become a Zen temple after his death. Construction began in the 1460s, in the years leading up to the Onin Civil War, which was partially precipitated by a power struggle involving the Ashikaga line: Yoshimasa handed power over to his younger brother and then belatedly tried to install his young son as shogun. In 1474, a few years before the Imperial House went bankrupt and his shogunate became powerless, Yoshimasa, seeing the end in sight, abdicated to give his full attention to the building of his villa and his taste for aristocratic pleasures. These included romance, moon gazing, and the tea ceremony, which he helped develop into a high art form. Though he never had time to complete the coating of the pavilion with silver foil, he constructed a dozen or so buildings. Many were designed for cultural pursuits, such as incense and tea ceremonies. On his death, the villa was converted into a Buddhist temple. However, with the decline of the Ashikaga family, Ginkaku-ji deteriorated, and many buildings were destroyed.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The remaining original buildings are <b>Togu-do</b> (East Seeking Hall) and Ginkaku-ji itself. The four other structures on the grounds were built in the 17th and 19th centuries. Yoshimasa is thought to have lived in the front room of Togu-do, and the statue of the priest is probably of Yoshimasa himself. The back room, called Dojin-sai (Comradely Abstinence), became the prototype for traditional tea-ceremony rooms. Ginkaku-ji is a simple and unadorned two-story building. Its appeal lies in the serene exterior shape, which combines Chinese elements such as bell windows with the developing Japanese Muromachi (1333-1568) architecture. The upper floor contains a gilt image of Kannon (goddess of mercy) said to have been carved by Unkei, a famous Kamakura-period sculptor; it\'s not, however ordinarily open to public view.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ginkaku-ji overlooks the complex <b>gardens,</b> attributed to artist and architect Soami (1465-1523). Yoshimasa based his villa on Kinkaku-ji, which belonged to his grandfather, Shogun Yoshimitsu Ashikaga, who in turn had based his design on the moss gardens at Koinzan Saiho-ji. The central concept of all three designs is the juxtaposition of a dry Zen garden of raked sand, which is reshaped daily, with a verdant pond garden. The <i>karensui,</i> or dry garden, is composed of a 2-foot-high platform of raked sand that is supposed to evoke the sea and two sculpted mounds, the higher one symbolizing, perhaps, Fuji-san. The garden sparkles in the moonlight and has been aptly named the Sea of Silver Sand. You enter the garden on a shrub-lined path leading to the <i>kara-mon,</i> or Chinese gabled gate.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To reach Ginkaku-ji, take Bus 5 from Kyoto Station to the Ginkaku-ji-michi bus stop. Walk east on the street along the canal. Cross a north-south canal and Hakusa Son-so Garden on your right; then go straight and Ginkaku-ji will be in front of you. COST: ¥500.

Nonetheless, once you are acclimatized, there are some interesting beverages to sample.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beer</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Each major city still has its own brewery, generally founded by Germans who emigrated here at the same time as they came to the United States, and microbreweries have started to pop up. There\'s also the CBN, the national beer company. As well as their standard brew, Paceña in La Paz often have special labels, which are always worth trying. Sureña in Sucre is a good bet. Avoid the Carnival beer, Bock—it has more alcohol than Carnival spirit.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Liquor</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For something a little different, try <i>singani,</i> the local liquor. It\'s best in the potent pisco sour made with lime juice or the slightly smoother <i>chuflay,</i> made with lemonade. <i>Chicha</i> is a grain alcohol locals concoct by chewing maize, spitting out the resulting mash, adding water, and allowing the mixture to ferment. The sweet, rather cloudy result is drunk mainly in the lowland valleys in and around Cochabamba, and tastes a lot better than it sounds, once you forget how it\'s made.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wine</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tarija, in the Andean foothills near the Argentine border, is Bolivia\'s wine-growing area. Wines have been produced here since the early 17th century. The major producers are La Concepcion and Kohlberg, although you can also buy good unlabeled wines in the <i>bodegas.</i> Tarija\'s Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon have won international medals.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bolivian History</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Almost everywhere in Bolivia you\'ll stumble across reminders of the country\'s long, eventful, and tragic history. A civilization said to be more advanced than the Inca thrived in Bolivia sometime between 600 BC and AD 1200 in an area 90 km (50 mi) west of La Paz called Tiwanaku. It\'s considered by many to be the \"cradle of the American civilizations.\" When the Inca arrived, the city was already in ruins, possibly destroyed by an earthquake. Spanish conquistadors conquered the Inca civilization in the 1500s—their stay has left its mark, particularly in Sucre and Potosí.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From its earliest days, Bolivia\'s fortunes have risen and fallen with its mineral wealth. Centuries ago it was the Inca and Aymara who dug deep for precious silver. In the 17th century, Spain\'s colonization of South America was fueled largely by the vast amounts of silver hidden deep in Cerro Rico, the \"Rich Hill\" that towers over Potosí in southern Bolivia. Cerro Rico\'s seemingly inexhaustible lode, first discovered in 1545, quickly brought thousands of prospectors to what was at the time the greatest mining operation in the New World. During the 17th and 18th centuries Potosí was the most populous and wealthiest city in the Americas. For the Spanish, the phrase <i>\"vale un Potosí\"</i> (\"worth a Potosí\") became a favorite description for untold wealth. But there\'s a darker side to the story. Some 8 million indigenous Quechua people died in the mines after being forced to stay inside the airless tunnels for as long as six months. Even today, men who work in the mines have far shorter than average life spans and suffer from the same fates as their ancestors.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bolivia was named in honor of its liberator, Simón Bolívar, who proclaimed the country\'s independence from Spain in 1825; until then, it had been simply called Alto Peru. The country was once much, much larger than it is today, but losing wars has been a costly habit. It originally extended to the Pacific, but after rich deposits of nitrates were discovered in the Atacama Desert, Chile began to eye the region. During the War of the Pacific that broke out in 1879, Chile captured Bolivia\'s short stretch of coastline. Bolivia stubbornly believes that someday it will once again have a seaport. In addition, Bolivia lost 38,000 square mi when Brazil annexed a large part of the Amazon basin in 1903, then twice as much again after a dispute with Paraguay in 1938.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

And just as the road crews changed the landscape to accommodate the roadbed, Route 66 changed the social landscape as communities adapted to the new road.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The needs of the traveler were met by the new ideas of the gas station, the diner, and the motel—and nostalgic glimpses of those icons and that culture can still be found. In Seligman, for example, you can stop at Delgadillo\'s Snow Cap Drive-in for a \"small soda\" and a chance to admire vintage automobiles. In Hackberry you can pose for pictures with vintage cars, kitschy signs, and highway memorabilia while sipping sarsaparilla from a bottle of Route 66 Beer. If you take Exit 139 from Interstate 40, 5 mi west of Ash Fork, you\'ll find yourself at the beginning of the longest remaining continuous stretch of Route 66. It will take you almost 160 mi through Seligman, Peach Springs, Truxton, Valentine, Hackberry, Kingman, and Oatman, and on to the Colorado River near Topock.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Well, it was. In 1968, after about 150 years of constant use, the 294-foot-long landmark was sinking into the Thames. When Lake Havasu City founder, Robert McCullough, heard about this predicament, he actually set about buying London Bridge, having it disassembled, shipped 10,000 mi to northwestern Arizona, and rebuilt, stone by stone. The bridge was reconstructed on mounds of sand and took three years to complete. When it was finished, a mile-long channel was dredged under the bridge and water was diverted from Lake Havasu through the Bridgewater Channel. Today, the entire city is centered on this unusual attraction. At the base of the bridge, a colorful re-creation of an <b>English Village</b> houses a few curio shops and restaurants and offers good views of the channel of cool blue water flowing under London Bridge. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hualapai Mountain Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You haven\'t truly hiked in northwestern Arizona until you\'ve hiked in Hualapai Mountain Park. A 15-mi drive from town up Hualapai Mountain Road leads to the park\'s more than 2,300 wooded acres, with 16 mi of developed and undeveloped hiking trails, picnic areas, ATV trails, rustic cabins, and RV (full hookups) and tent areas. Along the park\'s trail system you\'ll find a striking variety of plant life such as prickly pear cactus and Arizona walnut. Abundant species of birds and mammals such as the piñon jay and the Abert squirrel live here, and pristine stands of unmarred aspen mark the higher elevations. Any of the trails can be hiked in about three hours. The <b>Hayden Peak Trail</b> is a branch of a 16-mi trail system, which links with many other trails at a high elevation. The popular <b>Aspen Peak Trail</b> is shorter, 2 mi one way. If you can only visit one place and do one thing in northwestern Arizona, hiking in Hualapai Mountain Park should be it. Trail maps are available at the park office. www.mcparks.com. COST: $5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hoover Dam</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1928 Congress authorized $175 million for construction of a dam on the Colorado River to control destructive floods, provide a steady water supply to seven Colorado River Basin states, and generate electricity. Considered one of the seven wonders of the industrial world, the art deco Hoover Dam is 726 feet high (the equivalent of a 70-story building) and 660 feet thick (more than the length of two football fields) at the base. Construction required 4.4 million cubic yards of concrete—enough to build a two-lane highway from San Francisco to New York. Originally referred to as Boulder Dam, the structure was later officially named Hoover Dam in recognition of President Herbert Hoover\'s role in the project. Look for artist Oskar Hansen\'s plaza sculptures, which include the 30-foot-tall <i>Winged Figures of the Republic.</i> Don\'t miss Hansen\'s most intriguing work: the plaza\'s terrazzo floor, inlaid with a celestial map.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The self-paced <b>Powerplant Tour</b> allows you to see the power plant generators and other features. Guide staffers give talks every 15 minutes at each stopping point from 9 to 4:15 (early tours are less crowded).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The guided <b>Hoover Dam Tour</b> gives visitors an up-close look at lesser-known parts of the dam. Tours begin at 9:30 and run every half hour until 3:30; it\'s not wheelchair accessible or for those under eight. Reservations are accepted for the Powerplant Tour, but Hoover Dam Tours are only offered on a first-come, first-served basis and are limited to 20 participants.

There are still plenty of cheapies-but-goodies around, especially if you\'re willing to cast farther afield and explore some of the local casinos. But now that the city\'s become renowned as a gourmet food place, those ubiquitous buffets have followed suit.

You can tour the <b>Shark Reef</b> in about 45 minutes and then spend the rest of your time shopping at <b>Mandalay Place,</b> lunching at trendy <b>Burger Bar,</b> or hitting the blackjack tables. You could also avoid the Strip entirely and head to the <b>Hard Rock Hotel and Casino</b> for some last-minute gambling. If you\'re hungry, head to <b>Pink Taco</b> or <b>Mr. Lucky\'s 24/7.</b> If you need to stay near the airport, drive five minutes east of McCarran to the wonderfully campy <b>Liberace Museum,</b> an amusing slice of quintessential Vegas kitsch where you can easily while away an hour or more.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Vegas Virgin</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Head straight for the heart of the Strip to take in all that glitz and glamour you\'ve been itching to see. Walk across the miniaturized version of the Brooklyn Bridge at <b>New York-New York,</b> get all Francophiled at <b>Paris,</b> check out the dancing fountains in front of <b>Bellagio,</b> and do as the Romans would and take a stroll through <b>Caesars</b> (the Forum Shops have great lunch options, both simple and swanky). Ride a gondola at the <b>Venetian</b> and join the throngs of wide-eyed admirers at <b>Wynn Las Vegas.</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You\'ll want to go back to your hotel to freshen up before your night on the town. Then splurge on dinner at a true destination restaurant like <b>Joël Robuchon</b> at the MGM Grand or <b>Alex</b> at Wynn Las Vegas. Don\'t even think about turning in until you hit the nightlife scene. Our picks? A burlesque show at <b>Ivan Kane\'s Forty Deuce,</b> or <b>Mix</b> atop THEhotel at Mandalay Bay for the sweeping view of the Strip. Then finish off with some gambling or a show—we love Cirque du Soleil\'s <i>O.</i></div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Sophisticate</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Enjoy breakfast poolside at the <b>Verandah</b> restaurant in the tranquil, nongaming Four Seasons resort, on the property of Mandalay Bay. Continue on to the <b>Bathhouse Spa</b> inside the chic THEhotel,</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">the boutique hotel at Mandalay Bay, where you can soak in an Asian green-tea bath. Take a cab to Bellagio and cruise the <b>Via Bellagio</b> for Prada, Armani, Chanel, and Tiffany &amp; Co. At lunch nab a window seat at <b>Olives</b> for views of the dancing fountains and Lake Bellagio.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the afternoon, take a breather and relax by the pool of your hotel, margarita in hand. Or, if you have nonstop energy, head to the Venetian\'s <b>Guggenheim Hermitage Museum,</b> which has exhibits from the Guggenheim Museum in New York and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. Just be sure to give yourself enough time to get ready for dinner (try Hubert Keller\'s <b>Fleur de Lys,</b> or Michael Mina\'s <b>Nobhill</b>).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">End the evening by attending <b>Love,</b> the Cirque du Soleil show. Or, as an alternative to a show, hit the nightclub scene, checking out either trendy <b>Tao</b> at the Venetian or <b>Pure</b> at Caesars Palace.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bring the Kids</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though the casinos aren\'t the place for your kids, you can still find plenty of great family-oriented activities on the Strip. If your kids dig animals, check out the <b>Shark Reef</b> at Mandalay Bay, home to hammerhead, zebra, and bonnet-head sharks. Next, head to <b>Gameworks,</b> in the Showcase Mall (it\'s next to MGM Grand). It\'s a huge arcade and entertainment complex with tons of diversions for all ages. Break for lunch across the street in the lively Greenwich Village-theme food court at <b>New York-New York,</b> after which you might take a ride on <b>the Roller Coaster.</b> If you\'re up for an afternoon of thrills, continue north along the Strip to the <b>Stratosphere Tower.</b> Here, the Big Shot, X Scream, and Insanity-The Ride fly high above the Strip at 1,149 feet.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When you\'re ready for dinner, <b>Roxy\'s Diner</b> at the Stratosphere is a good choice. For a mellower but still enjoyable afternoon, head off to <b>Madame Tussaud\'s Wax Museum</b> at the Venetian. After posing next to Britney Spears and J-Lo look-alikes, go for a <b>gondola ride</b> on the Grand Canal through St. Mark\'s Square. Finish your evening by taking in one of the Strip sidewalk shows, either the <b>Bellagio</b> fountains or the exploding volcano at the <b>Mirage.</b></div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Out for the Afternoon</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Stunning desert scenery and outdoorsy diversions are much closer to the Strip than you might think. Make the 25-mi drive southeast of Vegas to <b>Boulder City,</b> stopping for a quick look at the handsome and historic <b>Boulder Dam Hotel.</b> Continue 8 mi to spectacular <b>Hoover Dam</b> for a tour and some great photo-ops of the Colorado River and Black Canyon.

Don\'t even think about heading up here if you have serious vertigo. People have been known to get sick just watching these rides.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Big Shot</b> would be a monster ride on the ground, but starting from the 112th floor makes it twice as wild. Four riders are strapped into chairs on four sides of the needle, which rises from the Stratosphere\'s observation pod. With little warning, you\'re flung 160 feet up the needle, then dropped like a rock. The whole thing is over in less than a minute, but your knees will wobble for the rest of the day.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>X Scream</b> tips passengers over the edge of the tower like a giant seesaw again and again. Sit in the very front so you\'ll get an unobstructed view of the Strip, straight down!</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Another unobstructed view can be seen by dangling over the edge of the tower off the arm of <b>Insanity</b> (www.insanityride.com). The arm pivots and hangs you out 64 feet from the edge of the tower; then it spins you faster and faster, so you\'re lifted to a 70-degree angle by a centrifugal force that\'s the equivalent of 3 g-forces. www.stratospherehotel.com.

Get ready to go 67 mph over a dizzying succession of high-banked turns and camelback hills, twirl through a \"heartline twist\" (like a jet doing a barrel roll), and finally rocket along a 540-degree spiral before pulling back into the station. www.nynyhotelcasino.com.

A vertical wind tunnel produces a powerful stream of air that lets you float, hover, and fly, simulating a real freefall experience. Airspeeds reach 120 mph. You can only make reservations with 10 or more people, but they close for private parties from time to time, so it\'s wise to call ahead under any circumstances. www.flyspace.com. COST: $75.

(No, the tiger that mauled Roy in 2003 is not on view.) At the Dolphin Habitat you can watch the Atlantic bottle-nosed dolphins swim around in a 2.5-million-gallon saltwater tank. Pass through the underwater observation station to the video room, where you can watch tapes of two dolphin births at the habitat. There\'s also a deluxe trainer-for-a-day program that gets you up-close and personal with the animals if you\'ve got the time and $500 or so. www.miragehabitat.com. COST: $15.

It\'s worth aiming for concert and dance season in Lausanne: from September through May. Prime ski time in the Alpes Vaudoises is from late December through Easter, and prices go up accordingly.

Chillon was built on Roman foundations under the direction of Duke Peter of Savoy with the help of military architects from Plantagenet England. For a long period it served as a state prison, and one of its shackled guests was François Bonivard, who supported the Reformation and enraged the Savoyards. He spent six years in this prison, chained most of the time to a pillar in the dungeon, before being released by the Bernese in 1536.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While living near Montreux, Lord Byron visited Chillon and was so transported by its atmosphere and by Bonivard\'s grim sojourn that he was inspired to write his famous poem \"The Prisoner of Chillon.\" He charts the prisoner\'s despair and brief moments of hope, culminating in the realization on release that \"these heavy walls to me had grown/A hermitage—and all my own!/…So much a long communion tends/To make us what we are:—even I/Regain\'d my freedom with a sigh.\" Like a true tourist, Byron carved his name on a pillar in Bonivard\'s still-damp and chilly dungeon; his graffito is now protected under a plaque.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In high season visitors to Chillon must now file placidly from restored chamber to restored turret, often waiting at doorways for entire busloads of fellow tourists to pass. Yet the restoration is so evocative and so convincing, with its tapestries, carved fireplaces, period ceramics and pewter, and elaborate wooden ceilings, that even the jaded castle hound may become as carried away as Byron was. While you\'re waiting your turn, you can gaze out the narrow windows over the sparkling, lapping water and remember Mark Twain, who thought Bonivard didn\'t have it half bad.

Augustus the Strong hired a small army of artists and artisans to create a \"pleasure ground\" worthy of the Saxon court on the site of the former bailey, part of the city fortifications. The artisans worked under the direction of the architect Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann, who came reluctantly out of retirement to design what would be his greatest work, begun in 1707 and completed in 1728. Completely enclosing a central courtyard filled with lawns, pools, and fountains, the complex is made up of six linked pavilions, one of which boasts a carillon of Meissen bells, hence its name: Glockenspielpavillon.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Zwinger is quite a scene—a riot of garlands, nymphs, and other baroque ornamentation and sculpture. Wide staircases beckon to galleried walks and to the romantic Nymphenbad, a coyly hidden courtyard where statues of nude women perch in alcoves to protect them from a fountain that spits unexpectedly. The Zwinger once had an open view of the riverbank, but the Semper Opera House now closes in that side.

Originally the center of a 13th-century monastery, the tall church (rebuilt in the 15th century) now stands by itself. Bach wrote most of his cantatas for the church\'s famous boys\' choir, the Thomanerchor, which was founded in the 13th century; the church continues as the choir\'s home as well as a center of Bach tradition.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The great music Bach wrote during his Leipzig years commanded little attention in his lifetime, and when he died, he was given a simple grave, without a headstone, in the city\'s Johannisfriedhof (St. John Cemetery). It wasn\'t until 1894 that an effort was made to find where the great composer lay buried, and after a thorough, macabre search, his coffin was removed to the Johanniskirche. That church was destroyed by Allied bombs in December 1943, and Bach subsequently found his final resting place in the church he would have selected: the Thomaskirche. You can listen to the famous boys\' choir during the <i>Motette,</i> a service with a special emphasis on choral music.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bach\'s 12 children and the infant Richard Wagner were baptized in the early-17th-century font; Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels also stood before this same font, godfathers to Karl Liebknecht, who grew up to be a revolutionary as well. www.thomaskirche.org.

It never saw battle, though, and instead became a political prison for Peter\'s rebellious son, Alexei and later held Dostoyevsky, Gorky, and Trotsky to name a few. The dynasty of Russian tsars is buried within the fortress.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Getting Caught with Your Bridges Up</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">St. Petersburg\'s mighty Neva River creates some of its most picturesque views, making it easy to forget that it is a working river and transport route for the import and export of many goods and raw materials. A working river, yes, but not during winter when it freezes over. This means that during the navigation season (April-November), the Neva is crowded with ships making up for the winter months. However, since its bridges are too low to allow ships to pass and it would cripple the city to lift them frequently during the day, the city\'s bridges are raised at night from 1 AM to about 5 AM. There are published schedules for each bridge, some of which are lowered once during the night, but these are notoriously unreliable. If you don\'t want to get caught on the wrong side of the river from where you are staying and be stuck until morning, think about heading home before 1 AM. What at first sounds like a terrific inconvenience for a large, busy city has been turned into something positive by St. Petersburgers: during White Nights the raising of attractively illuminated bridges has become a crowd-pleasing ritual and \"I missed the bridges\" has become the perfect excuse to party until dawn.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">White Nights</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">St. Petersburg is located at 59 degrees north latitude, roughly the same latitude as Oslo, Norway; Stockholm, Sweden; and Anchorage, Alaska. Due to this northerly position, the summer months receive many more hours of sunlight, especially in June and July. Known as White Nights, the sun\'s short trip around this part of the earth creates an ethereal glow of twilight into the wee hours. \"On such nights, it\'s hard to fall asleep because it\'s too light and because any dream will be inferior to this reality. Where a man doesn\'t cast a shadow, like water,\" wrote poet Joseph Brodsky. If you are visiting St. Petersburg during this time, you should partake in the many festivals, such as the Mariinsky Theatre\'s Stars of the White Nights, and spend at least one late night outdoors. Take a walk around the historic center, by Peter and Paul Fortress, St. Isaac\'s Cathedral, and the State Hermitage Museum which all face the Neva. Stroll along the banks of the river until you come across a bridge such as Dvortsovy most (Palace Bridge) next to the Hermitage and stop to watch the ships pass through the open bridge. Each bridge has its own time schedule but they begin to open at approximately 1 AM and close at about 5 AM. If you don\'t want to stay out all night, be sure to stay on the side of the river that your hotel is on. However, getting trapped on the other side of the city is rather romantic and you\'ll see couples kissing on the embankment while \"waiting\" for the bridges to close.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

As the former private art collection of the tsars, this is one of the world\'s most famous museums, virtually wallpapered with celebrated paintings. In addition, the walls are works of art themselves, for this collection is housed in the lavish Winter Palace, one of the most outstanding examples of Russian baroque magnificence. The museum takes its name from Catherine the Great (1729-96), who used it for her private apartments, intending them to be a place of retreat and seclusion. \"Only the mice and I can admire all this,\" the empress once declared.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Between 1764 and 1775, the empress undertook, in competition with rulers whose storehouses of art greatly surpassed Russia\'s, to acquire some of the world\'s finest works of art. In doing so, sometimes acquiring entire private collections outright, she quickly filled her gallery with masterpieces from all over the world. This original gallery section of the Hermitage, completed in 1770 by Vallin de la Mothe, is now known as the Maly (Little) Hermitage. It\'s attached to the Stary (Old) Hermitage, which was built in 1783 by Yuri Felten to house the overflow of art, and also contained conference chambers for the tsarina\'s ministers. Attached to the Hermitage by an arch straddling the Winter Canal is the <b>Hermitage Theater</b> built between 1783 and 1787, created for Catherine the Great by the Italian architect Giacomo Quarenghi. Yet another addition, the New Hermitage, was built between 1839 and 1852 under Catherine\'s grandson, Nicholas I; it became Russia\'s first public museum, although admission was by royal invitation only until 1866. Its facade is particularly striking, with 10 male figures cut from monolithic gray granite supporting the portico. Today\'s Hermitage is one of the world\'s richest repositories of art; it was continually enlarged with tsarist treasures and acquisitions, all later confiscated and nationalized, along with numerous private collections, by the Soviet government after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The entrance to the museum is through the main gates on Palace Square. When you first enter the Hermitage you\'ll see a <i>kassa</i> (ticket window) on both the right and left. Once you purchase your tickets, you can check your belongings and then return to enter the hall that was to your left as you entered the museum. Be forewarned that the ticket-takers are strict about oversize bags and about foreigners trying to enter on Russian-rate tickets.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With more than 400 exhibit halls and gilded salons, it\'s impossible to see everything here in a single day. It has been estimated that in order to spend one minute on each object on display, you would have to devote several years to the museum. Since you probably only have a few hours, be sure to take in the major attractions such as: Egyptian mummies and Scythian gold; the splendid halls of Russian tsars; the Peacock Clock; the great paintings of Leonardo, Rembrandt, Van Dyck, and Velaskes; and the outstanding collection of impressionists and postimpressionists.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Official guided tours (in English) tend to be rushed and you may want to return on your own. Consider hiring a private guide from outside the museum instead—their licensing requires a year of study and training and they\'ll take their time explaining the artwork to you. During peak tourist season, or when there\'s a special exhibition, you may encounter long lines at the museum entrance. Note that the Hermitage is closed on Monday.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although the museum is divided into eight sections, they are not clearly marked, and the floor plans available are not very useful, though they are in English as well as Russian. To orient yourself before your trip, you can go on a virtual tour of the museum on the Web site (<i>www.hermitagemuseum.org</i>). Just after you have your ticket checked at the front entrance, head straight to the computer consoles in front of you—the plans shown here are similarly short on information, but you can print them out, complete with instructions on how to get to various rooms. Enjoy your wander, and don\'t be shy about asking the guards to point you in the right direction. There\'s also a helpful information desk in the main hall, before you go into the museum, where you can ask specific questions.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are three floors to wander through. The <b>ground floor</b> covers prehistoric times, displaying discoveries made on former Soviet territory, including Scythian relics and artifacts; art from the Asian republics, the Caucasus, and their peoples; and Greek, Roman, and Egyptian art and antiquities. On the ground floor, head for the Hall of Ancient Egypt, the Pazyryk exhibition, and the Hall of the Big Vase. The first contains the remains of a mummified priest; the second, a mummified Scythian tsar and his horses as well as the most ancient carpet in the world; the third, a magnificent example of Russian stone-carving—the huge Kolyvan vase in the center of the hall. It\'s 2.57 meters (2.81 yards) high and weighs 19 tons.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Possibly the most prized section of the Hermitage—and definitely the most difficult to get into—is the ground floor\'s <b>Treasure Gallery,</b> also referred to as the Zolotaya Kladovaya (Golden Room). This spectacular collection of gold, silver, and royal jewels is well worth the hassle and expense of admission. The collection is divided into two sections. The first section, covering prehistoric times, includes Scythian gold and silver treasures of striking simplicity and refinement recovered from the Crimea, Ukraine, and Caucasus. The second section contains a dizzying display of precious stones, jewelry, and such extravagances as jewel-encrusted pillboxes and miniature clocks, all from the 16th through the 20th centuries.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You\'ll find the Pavilion Hall on the <b>first floor</b> which is known for the wonderous Peacock Clock. The hall itself, with 28 crystal chandeliers, is impressive in its own right. The Knights\' Room is also on this floor, with knights\' armor on display, including a child-size and a horse suit of armor.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You\'ll also find many rooms that have been left as they were when the Imperial family lived in the Winter Palace on the first floor. Through the entrance hall you can reach the first-floor galleries by way of the Jordan Staircase, a dazzling 18th-century creation of marble, granite, and gold. One of the first rooms you pass through on the first floor is the Malachite Room, with its displays of personal items from the Imperial family. In the White Dining Room the Bolsheviks seized power from the Provisional Government in 1917. Balls were staged in the small Concert Hall (which now also holds the silver coffin, and just the coffin, of the hero Alexander Nevsky) and, on grand occasions, in the Great Hall.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A wealth of Russian and European art is also on this floor: Florentine, Venetian, and other Italian art through the 18th century, including Leonardo\'s <i>Benois Madonna</i> and <i>Madonna Litta</i> (Room 214), Michelangelo\'s <i>Crouching Boy</i> (Room 229), two Raphaels, eight Titians, and works by Tintoretto, Lippi, Caravaggio, and Canaletto. The Hermitage also houses a superb collection of Spanish art, of which works by El Greco, Velázquez, Murillo, and Goya. Its spectacular presentation of Flemish and Dutch art contains roomfuls of Van Dycks, including portraits done in England when he was court painter to Charles I. Also here are more than 40 canvasses by Rubens (Room 247) and an equally impressive number of Rembrandts, including <i>Flora, Abraham\'s Sacrifice,</i> and <i>The Prodigal Son</i> (Room 254). The famous <i>Danaë,</i> which was mutilated by a knife- and acid-wielding lunatic in 1985, is back on exhibition once again. A smattering of excellent British paintings, extending also to the next floor, includes works by Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough, and George Morland.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Reflecting the Francophilia of the Empresses Elizabeth and Catherine, the museum is second only to the Louvre in its collection of French art. The scope is so extraordinary that the collection must be housed on both the first and second floors. Along with masterpieces by Lorrain, Watteau, and Poussin—including Poussin\'s <i>Tancrède et Herminie</i> (Room 279)—there are also early French art and handicrafts, including some celebrated tapestries.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the <b>second floor,</b> you can start with the French art of the 19th century, where you\'ll find Delacroix, Ingres, Corot, and Courbet. You then come to a stunning collection of impressionists and postimpressionists, originally gathered mainly by two prerevolutionary industrialists and art collectors, Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov. They include Monet\'s deeply affecting <i>A Lady in the Garden,</i> Degas\'s <i>Woman at Her Toilette</i> and <i>After the Bath,</i> and works by Sisley, Pissarro, and Renoir. Sculptures by Auguste Rodin and a host of pictures by Cézanne, Gauguin, and van Gogh are followed by Picasso and a lovely room of Matisse, including one of the amazing <i>Joys.</i> Somewhat later paintings—by the Fauvist André Derain and by Cubist Fernand Léger, for example—are also here. Rounding out this floor is the museum\'s collection of Asian and Middle and Near Eastern art, a small American collection, and two halls of medals and coins.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The best deal is to buy a two-day combined-entrance ticket, which allows you to visit the State Hermitage Museum and three other splendid museums: the original, wooden Winter Palace of Peter the Great, accessible through a tunnel (historians believe this is the site where Peter the Great died) from the museum; the General Staff Building; and Menshikov Palace. Tours in English (of several sections of the museum or just the Treasure Gallery) are available and highly recommended. Tours are normally given once or twice a day at 11:40 AM and 2:40 PM, but it\'s best to call ahead to be sure. An exchange bureau, Internet café, and theater ticket office are on the premises. www.hermitagemuseum.org.

He did so in tribute to his father, Alexander III, who had a special regard for Russian art and regretted, after seeing Moscow\'s Tretyakov Gallery, that St. Petersburg had nothing like it.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The collection at the museum, which is sometimes just referred to as the Russian Museum, is four times greater than Moscow\'s Tretyakov Gallery, with scores of masterpieces on display. Outstanding icons include the 14th-century <i>Boris and Gleb</i> and the 15th-century <i>Angel Miracle of St. George.</i> Both 17th- and 18th-century paintings are also well represented, especially with portraiture. One of the most famous 18th-century works here is Ivan Nikitin\'s <i>The Field Hetman.</i> By far the most important cache, however, comprises 19th-century works—huge canvases by Repin, many fine portraits by Serov (his beautiful <i>Countess Orlova</i> and the equally beautiful, utterly different portrait of the dancer Ida Rubinstein), and Mikhail Vrubel\'s strange, disturbing <i>Demon Cast Down.</i> For many years much of this work was unknown in the West, and it\'s fascinating to see the stylistic parallels and the incorporation of outside influences into a Russian framework. Painters of the World of Art movement—Bakst, Benois, and Somov—are also here. There are several examples of 20th-century art, with works by Kandinsky and Kazimir Malevich. Natan Altman\'s striking portrait of the poet Anna Akhmatova is in Room 77. The museum usually has at least one excellent special exhibit in place, and there\'s a treasure gallery here as well (guided tours only; you need a special ticket that you can get before noon). The Marble Palace, Engineer\'s Castle, and Stroganov Palace are all branches of the museum.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The square in front of the palace was originally named Mikhailovsky Ploshchad for Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich (1798-1849), the younger brother of Alexander I and Nicholas I and resident of the palace. The square\'s appearance is the work of Carlo Rossi, who designed the facade of each building encircling it as well as the Mikhailovsky Palace. Each structure, as well as the plaza itself, was made to complement Mikhail\'s residence on its north side. The palace, which was built between 1819 and 1825, comprises a principal house and two service wings. The central portico, with eight Corinthian columns, faces a large courtyard now enclosed by a fine art nouveau railing, a late (1903) addition. The statue of Alexander Pushkin in the center of the plaza was designed by Mikhail Anikushin and erected in 1957. www.rusmuseum.ru. COST: 300R. OPEN: Mon. 10-5, Wed.-Sun. 10-6, kassa open until 1 hr before closing. Metro:Nevsky Prospekt. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">St. Isaac\'s Cathedral</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Of the grandest proportions, St. Isaac\'s is the world\'s third-largest domed cathedral and the first monument you see of the city if you arrive by ship. Its architectural distinction is a matter of taste; some consider the massive design and highly ornate interior to be excessive, whereas others revel in its opulence. Tsar Alexander I commissioned the construction of the cathedral in 1818 to celebrate his victory over Napoléon, but it took more than 40 years to actually build it. The French architect Auguste Ricard de Montferrand devoted his life to the project, and died the year the cathedral was finally consecrated, in 1858.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tickets, which can be bought at the kassa outside, are sold both to the church (\"the museum\") and to the outer colonnade; the latter affords an excellent view of the city. Follow the signs in English. The interior of the cathedral is lavishly decorated with malachite, lazulite, marble, and other precious stones and minerals. Gilding the dome required 220 pounds of gold. At one time a Foucault pendulum hung here to demonstrate the axial rotation of the earth, but it was removed in the late 20th century. After the Revolution of 1917 it was closed to worshippers and in 1931 was opened as a museum; services have since resumed. St. Isaac\'s was not altogether returned to the Orthodox Church, but Christmas and Easter are celebrated here (note that Orthodox holidays follow the Julian calendar and fall about 13 days after their Western equivalents).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When the city was blockaded during World War II, the gilded dome was painted black to avoid its being targeted by enemy fire. Despite efforts to protect it, the cathedral nevertheless suffered heavy damage, as bullet holes on the columns on the south side attest.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Opening up in front of the cathedral is <b>Isaakievskaya Ploshchad</b> (St. Isaac\'s Square), which was completed only after the cathedral was built. In its center stands the <b>Nicholas Statue.</b> Unveiled in 1859, this statue of Tsar Nicholas I was commissioned by the tsar\'s wife and three children, whose faces are engraved (in the allegorical forms of Wisdom, Faith, Power, and Justice) on its base. It was designed, like St. Isaac\'s Cathedral, by Montferrand. The statue depicts Nicholas mounted on a rearing horse. Other engravings on the base describe such events of the tsar\'s reign as the suppression of the Decembrists\' uprising and the opening ceremonies of the St. Petersburg-Moscow railway line.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To one side of the cathedral, where the prospekt meets Konnogvardeisky bulvar, is the early-19th-century <b>Konnogvardeisky Manège,</b> gracefully designed by Giacomo Quarenghi and decorated with marble statues of the mythological twins Castor and Pullox. This former barracks of the Imperial horse guards is used as an art exhibition hall. Every January it hosts an exhibition of new works by St. Petersburg artists. COST: Cathedral 300R, colonnade 150R. OPEN: Cathedral May-Sept., Thurs.-Tues. 10AM-7PMand 8PM-10:30PM; Oct.-Apr., Thurs.-Tues. 11-6, and 7PM-9:30PM. Metro:Sennaya Ploshchad. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Winter Palace</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With its 1,001 rooms swathed in malachite, jasper, agate, and gilded mirrors, this famous palace—the residence of Russia\'s rulers from Catherine the Great (1762) to Nicholas II (1917)—is the focal point of Palace Square. The palace, now the site of the State Hermitage Museum, is the grandest monument of that strange hybrid, the Russian rococo, in itself an eye-popping mix of the old-fashioned 17th-century baroque and the newfangled 18th-century neoclassical style (at the time of the palace\'s construction a chic import from France). Now \"Russianized,\" the palace\'s neoclassic ornament lost its early gracefulness and Greek sense of proportion and evolved toward the heavier, more monumental, Imperial style. Still, the exterior—adorned with rows of columns and outfitted with 2,000 heavily decorated windows—is particularly successful and pleasing; note the way its enormous horizontal expanses of outer wall are broken up by vertical lines and variations of lines, pediments, and porches, all topped with a roof balustrade of statues and vases.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The palace, which was created by the Italian architect Bartolomeo Francesco Rastrelli, stretches from Palace Square to the Neva River embankment. It was the fourth royal residence on this site, the first having been a wooden palace for Peter the Great (today, a remnant of this palace exists and has been restored; it can be visited separately within the State Hermitage Museum). Oddly enough, the all-powerful tsar had to observe some bureaucratic fine print himself. Because it was forbidden to grant land from this site to anyone not bearing naval rank, Peter had to obtain a shipbuilder\'s license before building his palace. The current palace was commissioned in 1754 by Peter the Great\'s daughter Elizabeth. By the time it was completed, in 1762, Elizabeth had died and the craze for the Russian rococo style had waned. Catherine the Great left the exterior unaltered but had the interiors redesigned in the neoclassical style of her day. In 1837, after the palace was gutted by fire, the interiors were revamped once again. Three of the most celebrated rooms are the <b>Gallery of the 1812 War,</b> where portraits of Russian commanders who served against Napoléon are on display; the <b>Great Throne Room,</b> richly decorated in marble and bronze; and the <b>Malachite Room,</b> designed by the architect Alexander Bryullov and decorated with columns and pilasters of malachite. These rooms and parts of the Winter Palace that encompass the State Hermitage Museum are the only bits of the palace on view to the public. When touring the museum, you must therefore think of portions of it as the Imperial residence it once was. www.hermitagemuseum.org. COST: 200R.

Besides, <i>beautiful, verdant, spectacular,</i> and <i>amazing</i> lose their meaning after repeated usage, so forget trying to think of words to describe it, but don\'t forget to experience Kauai\'s remote, northwest coastline any which way—by air, water, or trail, preferably all three.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Waimea Canyon Drive</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From its start in the west Kauai town of Waimea to the road\'s end some 20 uphill mi later at Puu O Kila lookout, you\'ll pass through several microclimates—from hot, desertlike conditions at sea level to the cool, deciduous forest of Kokee—and navigate through the traditional Hawaiian system of land division called <i>ahupuaa.</i></div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hanalei Bay</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Families. Honeymooners. Retirees. Surfers. Sunbathers. Hanalei Bay attracts all kinds, for good reason—placid water in the summers; epic surf in the winters; the wide, 2-mi-long crescent-shape beach year-round; and the green mountain backdrop striated with waterfalls—also year-round but definitely in full force in winter. And did we mention the atmosphere? Decidedly laid-back.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Spas. Spas. Spas.</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kauai is characterized by its rural nature (read: quiet and peaceful), which lends itself nicely to the spa scene on the island. The vast majority of spas could be called rural, too, as they invite the outside in—or would that be the inside out? For a resort spa, ANARA Spa is not only decadent but set in a garden. A Hideaway Spa sits in a grove of old-style plantation homes, and Angeline\'s traditional Hawaiian spa Muolaulani is in her home.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Highway 560</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This 10-mi stretch of road starting at the Hanalei Scenic Overlook in Princeville rivals all in Hawaii and in 2003 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, one of only about 100 roads nationwide to meet the criteria. Indeed, the road itself is said to follow an ancient Hawaiian walking trail that skirts the ocean. Today, Route 560 includes 13 historic bridges and culverts, most of which are one lane wide. Be patient.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">River Kayaking</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The best part about kayaking Kauai\'s rivers is that you don\'t have to be experienced. There are no rapids to run, no waterfalls to jump, and therefore, no excuses for not enjoying the scenic sights from the water. On the East Side, try the Wailua River; if you\'re on the North Shore, don\'t miss the Hanalei River. But if you have some experience and are in reasonably good shape, you may choose to create a few lifetime memories and kayak Napali Coast.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sunshine Markets</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bananas. Mangos. Papayas. Lemons. Limes. Lychees. The best and freshest fruits, vegetables, flowers—and goat cheese—are found at various farmers\' markets around the island. Just don\'t get there too late in the day—all the best stuff goes early.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Snapshot of Hawaii</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Oahu.</b> The state\'s capital, Honolulu, is on Oahu; this is the center of Hawaii\'s economy and by far the most populated island in the chain—900,000 residents adds up to 71% of the state\'s population. At 597 square mi Oahu is the third largest island in the chain; the majority of residents live in or around Honolulu, so the rest of the island still fits neatly into the tropical, untouched vision of Hawaii. Situated southeast of Kauai and northwest of Maui, Oahu is a central location for island hopping. Surfing contests on the legendary North Shore, Pearl Harbor, and iconic Waikiki Beach are all here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Maui.</b> The second largest island in the chain, Maui\'s 729 square mi are home to only 119,000 people but host approximately 2.5 million tourists every year. Maui is northwest of the Big Island, and close enough to be visible from its beaches on a clear day. With its restaurants and lively nightlife, Maui is the only island that competes with Oahu in terms of entertainment; its charm lies in the fact that although entertainment is available, Maui\'s towns still feel like island villages compared to the heaving modern city of Honolulu.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Hawaii (The Big Island)</b>. The Big Island has the second largest population of the islands (167,000) but feels sparsely settled due to its size. It\'s 4,038 square mi and growing—all of the other islands could fit onto the Big Island and there would still be room left over. The southernmost island in the chain (slightly southeast of Maui), the Big Island is home to Kilauea, the most active volcano on the planet. It percolates within Volcanoes National Park, which draws 2.5 million visitors every year.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Kauai.</b> The northernmost island in the chain (northwest of Oahu), Kauai is, at approximately 550 square miles, the fourth largest of all the islands and the least populated of the larger islands, with just under 63,000 residents. Known as the Garden Isle, Kauai claims the title \"wettest spot on Earth\" with an annual average rainfall of about 450 inches. Kauai is a favorite with honeymooners and others wanting to get away from it all—lush and peaceful, it\'s the perfect escape from the modern world.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Molokai.</b> North of Lanai and Maui, and east of Oahu, Molokai is Hawaii\'s fifth largest island, encompassing 260 square mi. On a clear night, the lights of Honolulu are visible from Molokai\'s western shore. Molokai is sparsely populated, with just under 7,400 residents, the majority of whom are native Hawaiians. Most of Molokai\'s 85,000 annual visitors travel from Maui or Oahu to spend the day exploring its beaches, cliffs, and former leper colony on Kalaupapa Peninsula.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Lanai.</b> Lying just off Maui\'s western coast, Lanai looks nothing like its sister islands, with pine trees and deserts in place of palm trees and beaches. Still, the tiny 140-square-mi island is home to nearly 3,000 residents and draws an average of 90,000 visitors each year to two resorts (one in the mountains and one at the shore), both operated by Four Seasons.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Geology</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Hawaiian Islands comprise more than just the islands inhabited and visited by humans. A total of 19 islands and atolls constitutes the State of Hawaii, with a total landmass of 6,423.4 square mi. The Islands are actually exposed peaks of a submersed mountain range called the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain. The range was formed as the Pacific plate moved very slowly (around 32 mi every million years) over a \"hot spot\" in the Earth\'s mantle. Because the plate moved northwestwardly, the Islands in the northwest portion of the archipelago (chain) are older, which is also why they\'re smaller—they have been eroding longer.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Big Island is the youngest, and thus the largest, island in the chain. It is built from seven different volcanoes, including Mauna Loa, which is the largest shield volcano on the planet. Mauna Loa and Kilauea are the only Hawaiian volcanoes still erupting with any sort of frequency. Mauna Loa last erupted in 1984. Kilauea has been continuously erupting since 1983. Mauna Kea (Big Island), Hualalai (Big Island), and Haleakala (Maui) are all in what\'s called the Post Shield stage of volcanic development—eruptions decrease steadily for up to 250,000 years before ceasing entirely. Kohala (Big Island), Lanai (Lanai), and Waianae (Oahu) are considered extinct volcanoes, in the erosional stage of development; Koolau (Oahu) and West Maui (Maui) volcanoes are extinct volcanoes in the rejuvenation stage—after lying dormant for hundreds of thousands of years, they began erupting again, but only once every several thousand years.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There is currently an active undersea volcano called Loihi that has been erupting regularly. If it continues its current pattern, it should breach the ocean\'s surface in tens of thousands of years.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Flora &amp; Fauna</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though much of the plant life associated with Hawaii today (pineapple, hibiscus, orchid, plumeria) was brought by Tahitian, Samoan, or European visitors, Hawaii is also home to several endemic species, like the koa tree and the yellow hibiscus. Long-dormant volcanic craters are perfect hiding places for rare plants (like the silversword, a rare cousin of the sunflower, which grows on Hawaii\'s three tallest peaks: Haleakala, Mauna Kea, and Mauna Loa, and nowhere else on Earth). Many of these endemic species are now threatened by the encroachment of introduced plants and animals. Hawaii is also home to a handful of plants that have evolved into uniquely Hawaiian versions of their original selves. Mint, for example, develops its unique taste to keep would-be predators from eating its leaves. As there were no such predators in Hawaii for hundreds of years, a mintless mint evolved; similar stories exist for the Islands\' nettle-less nettles, thorn-less briars.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hawaii\'s climate is well suited to growing several types of flowers, most of which are introduced species. Plumeria creeps over all of the Islands; orchids run rampant on the Big Island; bright orange ilima light up the mountains of Oahu. These flowers give the Hawaiian leis their color and fragrance.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As with the plant life, the majority of the animals in Hawaii today were brought here by visitors. Axis deer from India roam the mountains of Lanai. The Islands are home to dozens of rat species, all stowaways on long boat rides over from Tahiti, England, and Samoa; the mongoose was brought to keep the rats out of the sugar plantations—a failed effort, as the mongoose hunts by day, the rat by night. Many of Hawaii\'s birds, like the nene (Hawaii\'s state bird) and the pueo (Hawaiian owl) are endemic; unfortunately, about 80% are also endangered.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The ocean surrounding the Islands teems with animal life. Once-scarce manta rays have made their way back to the Big Island; spinner dolphins and sea turtles can be found off the coast of all the Islands; and every year from December to May, the humpback whales migrate past Hawaii in droves.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">History</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Long before both Christopher Columbus and the Vikings, Polynesian seafarers set out to explore the vast stretches of open ocean in double-hulled canoes. Now regarded as some of the world\'s greatest navigators, the ancestors of the Hawaiian people sailed across the Pacific Ocean using the stars, birds, and sea life as their guides. From Western Polynesia they traveled back and forth between Samoa, Fiji, Tahiti, the Marquesas, and the Society Isles, settling the outer reaches of the Pacific, Hawaii, and Easter Island, as early as AD 300. The golden era of Polynesian voyaging peaked around AD 1200, after which the distant Hawaiian Islands were left to develop their own unique cultural practices in relative isolation.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When the British explorer Captain James Cook arrived in 1778, he found a deeply religious, agrarian society governed by numerous alii, or chiefs. Revered as a god upon his arrival, Cook was later killed in a skirmish over a stolen boat. With guns and ammunition purchased from Cook, the Big Island chief, Kamehameha, gained a significant advantage over the other Hawaiian alii. He united Hawaii into one kingdom in 1810, bringing an end to the frequent interisland battles that had previously dominated Hawaiian life. Tragically, the new kingdom was beset with troubles. Their religion was abandoned. European explorers brought foreign diseases with them; within a few short years the Hawaiian population was cut in half. It was further weakened by the onset of the sandalwood trade in the mid-1800s. All able-bodied men were sent into the forest to harvest the fragrant tree, so that Kamehameha\'s successor, Liholiho, could pay off debts incurred to American merchants. Onto this stage came rowdy foreign whalers, ambitious entrepreneurs, and well-intentioned but perhaps misguided missionaries. New laws regarding land ownership and religious practices eroded the cultural underpinnings of pre-contact Hawaii. Each successor to the Hawaiian throne sacrificed more control over the island kingdom. Finally in 1893, the last Hawaiian monarch, Queen Liliuokalani, was overthrown by a group of American and European businessmen and government officials, aided by an armed militia. This led to the creation of the Republic of Hawaii, which quickly became a territory of the United States through resolutions passed by Congress (rather than through treaties). Hawaii remained a territory for 60 years; Pearl Harbor was attacked as part of the United States in 1941 during World War II. It wasn\'t until 1959, however, that Hawaii was officially admitted as the 50th state.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Legends &amp; Mythology</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ancient deities play a huge role in Hawaiian life today—not just in daily rituals, but in the Hawaiians\' reverence for their land. Gods and goddesses tend to be associated with particular parts of the land, and most of them are connected with many places thanks to the body of stories built up around each.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The goddess Pele lives in Kilauea Volcano and rules over the Big Island. She is a feisty goddess known for turning enemies into trees or destroying the homes of adversaries with fire. She also has a penchant for gin, which is why you\'ll see gin bottles circling some of the craters at Volcanoes National Park. It\'s not the litter it appears to be, but rather an offering to placate the Volcano goddess. The Valley Isle\'s namesake, the demigod Maui, is a well-known Polynesian trickster. When his mother Hina complained that there were too few hours in the day, Maui promised to slow the sun. Upon hearing this, the god Moemoe teased Maui for boasting, but undeterred, the demigod wove a strong cord and lassoed the sun. Angry, the sun scorched the fields until an agreement was reached: during summer, the sun would travel more slowly. In winter, it would return to its quick pace. For ridiculing Maui, Moemoe was turned into a large rock that still juts from the water near Kahakualoa.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the most important ways the ancient Hawaiians showed respect for their gods and goddesses was through the hula. Various forms of the hula were performed as prayers to the gods and as praise to the chiefs. Performances were taken very seriously, as a mistake was thought to invalidate the prayer, or even to offend the god or chief in question. Hula is still performed both as entertainment and as prayer; it is not uncommon for a hula performance to be included in an official government ceremony.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hawaii Today</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hawaiian culture and traditions have experienced a renaissance over the last few decades. There is a real effort to revive traditions and to respect history as the Islands go through major changes and welcome more and more newcomers every day. New developments often have a Hawaiian cultural expert on staff to ensure cultural sensitivity and to educate newcomers.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nonetheless, development remains a huge issue for all Islanders—land prices are skyrocketing, putting many areas out of reach for the native population. Traffic is becoming a problem on roads that were not designed to accommodate all the new drivers, and the Islands\' limited natural resources are being seriously tapped. The government, though sluggish to respond at first, is trying to make development in Hawaii as sustainable as possible. Rules for new developments protect natural as well as cultural resources, and local governments have set ambitious conservation goals Despite all efforts to ease its effect on the land and its people, large-scale, rapid development is not anyone\'s ideal, and Islanders are understandably less than thrilled with the prospect of a million more tourists visiting every year or buying up property that residents themselves can\'t afford.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">That said, the aloha spirit is alive and well. Though you may encounter the occasional \"<i>haole</i> hater\" (<i>haole</i>—pronounced howlie—is a somewhat pejorative term for Caucasians), the majority of Islanders are warm, a welcoming people who are eager to share their culture with those who respect it.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The tour focuses on the original home, built by the Wilcox family in 1860 and filled with a quirky collection of classic Hawaiiana. You can also see the workers\' quarters, farm animals, orchards, and gardens that reflect the practical, self-sufficient lifestyle of the island\'s earliest Western inhabitants. Tours of the homestead are conducted twice a day, three days a week. To protect the historic building and its furnishings, tours may be canceled on very wet days. With a six-person limit per tour, reservations are essential; the tour is not suitable for young children. COST: $10. OPEN: Tours Mon., Wed., and Thurs. at 10 and 1. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kalalau</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This oft-described Garden of Eden awaits the intrepid hiker who traverses 11 arduous mi along sea cliff faces, through muddy coastal valleys, and across sometimes raging streams—all the while schlepping food provisions and camping gear in a backpack. The trek requires 6 to 10 hours of hiking, making it an adventure indeed. With serious planning and preparation, the effort is worth it. Another option is to paddle in to the beach—summer only, though; otherwise the surf is way too big. Located at the end of the trail with the same name, Kalalau is a remote, wilderness beach along the 15 mi of spectacular Napali Coast, itself a 6,500-acre state park. The beach is anchored by a <i>heiau</i> (a stone platform used as a place of worship) on one end, and a waterfall on the other. The safest hiking to and swimming at the beach takes place during the summer months when the rains abate, so the trail can dry out, and when the North Shore\'s famous winter surf recedes, revealing an expansive beach cupped by low, vegetated sand dunes and a large walk-in cave on the western edge. Day hikes into the valley reveal waterfalls, freshwater swimming pools, and wild, tropical fruits, as well as illegal campers forsaking society. Don\'t be mistaken: camping permits are required. www.hawaiistateparks.org. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lawai Kai</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the most spectacular beaches on the South Shore is inaccessible by land unless you tour the National Tropical Botanical Garden\'s Allerton Garden—which we highly recommend, or trespass behind locked fences—which we don\'t recommend. On the tour, you\'ll see the beach, but you won\'t lounge on it or frolic in the calm water behind the promontory on the eastern point of the beach. One way to legally access the beach on your own is by paddling a kayak 1 mi from Kukuiula Harbor. However, you have to rent the kayaks elsewhere and haul them on top of your car to the harbor. Also, the wind and waves usually run westward, making the in-trip a breeze but the return trip a workout against Mother Nature. Another way is to boulder-hop along the coast from Spouting Horn—a long trek over sharp lava rock that we do not recommend. Do not attempt this beach in any manner during a south swell. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Poipu Beach Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most popular beach on the South Side, and perhaps on all of Kauai, is Poipu Beach Park. The snorkeling\'s good, the body boarding\'s good, the surfing\'s good, the swimming\'s good, and the fact that the sun is almost always shining is good, too. The beach can be crowded at times, especially on weekends and holidays, but that just makes people-watching that much more fun. You\'ll see <i>keiki</i> (children) experiencing the ocean for the first time, snorkelers trying to walk with their flippers on, ukulele players, birthday-party revelers, young and old, visitors and locals. Even the endangered Hawaiian monk seal may make an appearance. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hanakapiai Beach</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\'re not up for the 11-mi haul to Kalalau Beach, then hike 2 mi along Napali Coast\'s Kalalau Trail to Hanakapiai Beach. It\'ll take about 1½ hours. Just don\'t get in the water. Ever. The water here is what locals like to call \"confused.\" It has something to do with the radical change in water depth and sheer cliff walls creating wicked currents, rogue waves, backwash, undertow, cross waves, and rip currents. Get the picture? Enjoy a picnic away from the ocean\'s edge. In the winter when the surf eats up the beach, this might mean perching on the lava rock boulders backing the sand. To reach the beach, you\'ll have to boulder-hop across a stream. During heavy rains or even just after, the stream can flood, stranding hikers on the wrong side. This has resulted in helicopter rescues, so don\'t cross unless the boulders are visibly exposed. www.hawaiistateparks.org. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Polihale State Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The longest stretch of beach in Hawaii starts in Kekaha and ends about 15 mi away at the start of Napali Coast. At the Napali end of the beach is the 5-mi-long, 140-acre Polihale State Park. In addition to being long, this beach is 300 feet wide in places and backed by sand dunes 50 to 100 feet tall. Polihale is a remote beach accessed via a 5-mi cane-haul road (four-wheel drive preferred but not required) at the end of Route 50 in Kekaha. Be sure to start the day with a full tank of gas and a cooler filled with food and drink. Many locals wheel their four-wheel-drive vehicles up and over the sand dunes right onto the beach, but don\'t try this in a rental car. You\'re sure to get stuck and found in violation of your rental-car agreement.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On weekends and holidays Polihale is a popular locals\' camping location, but even on \"busy\" days this beach is never crowded. On days of high surf, only experts surf the waves. In general, the water here is extremely rough and not recommended for recreation; however, there\'s one small fringing reef, called Queen\'s Pond, where swimming is usually safe. Neighboring Polihale Beach is the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF), operated by the U.S. Navy. Since September 11, 2001, access to the beaches fronting PMRF is restricted. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The best of his collection is permanently on display. The finest of the paintings, the 18th-century <i>Virgen de Pomato,</i> represents the Earth, with her mountain-shape cloak covered with garlands of corn.

This was the city\'s first cemetery, and the underground tunnels contain the earthly remains of some 75,000 people, which you visit on a tour (available in English). The Church of Saint Francis is the most visited in Lima, mostly because of these catacombs. But it\'s also the best example of what is known as \"Lima Baroque\" style of architecture. The handsome carved portal would later influence those on other churches, including the Iglesia de la Merced. The central nave is known for its beautiful ceilings painted in a style called <i>mudejar</i> (a blend of Moorish and Spanish designs). On the tour you\'ll see the adjoining monastery\'s immense collection of antique texts, some dating back to the 17th century. COST: S/5.

Start at the Rossío, the main downtown square, and stroll through the Baixa, pausing to window-shop or take a coffee. Wander into the Alfama quarter by way of the Sé, following the winding streets past lookout points and churches as far as the hilltop Castelo de São Jorge. The views here are magnificent, and you can grab lunch at one of the many nearby cafés and restaurants. A tram ride takes you back down to the Baixa, where, in the riverside Praça do Comércio, you pick up another tram for the rattling ride west to Belém and the magnificent Mosteiro dos Jerónimos, the acclaimed Torre de Belém, and the <i>Padrão dos Descobrimentos.</i> On the way back to the city center, stop off at the Museu de Arte Antiga.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Your second day can be less hectic. Head up to the Bairro Alto and the Chiado shopping area and spend the morning browsing in galleries and stores, visiting the Igreja de São Roque and popping into the Instituto do Vinho do Porto for a glass of port. Have lunch in one of the small taverns or restaurants, and then return to the Baixa via the Elevador da Glória. Take the metro uptown to the Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian, where you can spend a few hours viewing the collections in the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian and the adjacent Centro de Arte Moderna. Alternatively, take the metro to Parque das Nações to visit the Oceanário de Lisboa.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 4 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend the first morning in the Baixa, where the shops and cafés are inviting. At the riverside Praça do Comércio, take a ferry across the river and back for fine city views. Have lunch in the suburb of Cacilhas, where the ferry docks, or return to Praça dos Restauradores, just north of the Rossío, where a side street just off the square—Rua das Portas de Santo Antão—is lined with well-known fish restaurants. Spend the afternoon in the Alfama, taking in the Sé, the Castelo de São Jorge, and the Museu-Escola de Artes Decorativas.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On your second day, catch a tram out to Belém. Spend half the day exploring the monastery and monuments; you\'ll also have time for at least one of the specialty museums—Museu da Marinha, or Museu Nacional de Coches. On your way to or from Belém, stop at the Museu de Arte Antiga.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Split your two remaining days between old and modern Lisbon. One full day should involve seeing the Chiado shopping area and exploring the Bairro Alto. Be sure to pop into the Convento do Carmo\'s archaeological museum and make a side trip to the Jardim da Estrêla, or you can spend more time at the Oceanário de Lisboa.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the final day, walk the length of the boulevard-like Avenida da Liberdade to the city\'s main park, Parque Eduardo VII, where the greenhouses are a treat.

The collection is split in two: one part is devoted to Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Islamic, and Asian art and the other to European acquisitions. Both holdings are relatively small, but the quality of the pieces is magnificent, and you should aim to spend at least two hours here. English-language notes are available throughout.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the gardens outside, sculptures are found in every recess. Follow signs to the Centro de Arte Moderna, which has one of the finest collections of Portuugese modern art. If it\'s all too much to take in at one time, break up your visit with a stop in the main museum\'s basement café-restaurant. There\'s also a large shop that sells posters and postcards. www.museu.gulbenkian.pt. COST: EUR 3, combined ticket with Modern Art Center EUR 5; free Sun. OPEN: Tues.-Sun. 10-5:45. Metro:São Sebastião or Praça de Espanha. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mosteiro dos Jerónimos</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Conceived and commissioned by Dom Manuel I, who petitioned the Holy See for permission to build it in 1496, Belém\'s famous Jerónimos Monastery was financed largely by treasures brought back from Africa, Asia, and South America. Construction began in 1502 under the supervision of Diogo de Boitaca.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This UNESCO World Heritage Site is a supreme example of the Manueline style of building (named after King Dom Manuel I), which represented a marked departure from the prevailing Gothic. Much of it is characterized by elaborate sculptural details, often with a maritime motif. João de Castilho was responsible for the southern portal, which forms the main entrance to the church: the figure on the central pillar is Henry the Navigator. Inside, the spacious interior contrasts with the riot of decoration on the six nave columns and complex latticework ceiling. This is the resting place of both explorer Vasco de Gama and national poet Luís de Camões. Don\'t miss the Gothic- and Renaissance-style double cloister, also designed to stunning effect by Castilho. The Hieronymite community lived in the monastery for more than 400 years until the dissolution of religious orders in 1833. www.mosteirojeronimos.pt. COST: Cloister EUR 6, EUR 10 combination ticket includes Torre de Belém and Palacio de Ajuda; free Sun. OPEN: May-Sept., Tues.-Sun. 10-6; Oct.-Apr., Tues.-Sun. 10-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Castelo de São Jorge</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although St. George\'s Castle was constructed by the Moors, the site had previously been fortified by Romans and Visigoths. At the main entrance is a statue of Dom Afonso Henriques, whose forces in 1147 besieged the castle and drove the Moors from Lisbon. The ramparts offer panoramic views of the city\'s layout as far as the towering Ponte 25 de Abril suspension bridge; be careful of the uneven footing. Remnants of a palace that was a residence of the kings of Portugal until the 16th century house a cozy, stately restaurant, and a multimedia exhibit on the city\'s history that brings to life the drama of such episodes as the Great Earthquake of 1755. From the Câmara Escura in the Torre de São Lourenço, in the castle\'s keep, you can spy on visitors going about their business below. The outer walls encompass a small neighbourhood, Castelo, the medieval church of Santa Cruz, restaurants, and souvenir shops. COST: Castle EUR 5.

Ljubljana is vibrant the whole year through. Many visitors want to head straight for the coast. Those in search of sea, sun, and all-night parties will find what they\'re looking for in peak season (July and August), including cultural events, open-air dancing, busy restaurants, and crowded beaches. If you want to avoid the crowds, hit the Adriatic in June or September, when it should be warm enough to swim and easier to find a place to put your beach towel.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the mountains there are two distinct seasons: winter is dedicated to skiing, summer to hiking and biking. Some hotels close in November and March to mark a break between the two periods. Conditions for more strenuous walking and biking are optimal in April, May, September, and October.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lovers of fine food and wine should visit Slovenia during fall. The grape harvest concludes with the blessing of the season\'s young wine on St. Martin\'s Day, preceded by three weeks of festivities. In rural areas autumn is the time to make provisions for the hard winter ahead: wild mushrooms are gathered, firewood is chopped, and <i>koline</i> (sausages and other pork products) are prepared by hand.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Great Itineraries</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Slovenia\'s small size can be an advantage. From the centrally located capital, Ljubljana, you can drive to any point in the country in three or four hours.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you have limited time, take one day to discover the Old Town of <b>Ljubljana.</b> For the next two days, choose between the mountains or the coast. If you\'re looking for natural beauty and/or adventure, head for the mountains and lakes of Triglav National Park. Base yourself in <b>Bled</b> or <b>Bohinj.</b> For the third day, get an early start and head for <b>Bovec,</b> via <b>Kranjska Gora,</b> for hiking or white-water rafting on the Soca River. If you seek sun and sea instead, go southwest toward the Karst and coast. Stop off at the Skocjan Caves en route, and spend your nights in the beautiful Venetian port of <b>Piran.</b></div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 5 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For a longer stay, combine the two optional itineraries listed above. Spend the first day and night exploring Ljubljana\'s Old Town before making your way northwest to the mountains. After nights in Bled and/or Bohinj and exploring the Soca River valley, continue southwest to the coast. Use Piran as your base for visiting the coastal towns of <b>Izola</b> and <b>Portoroz.</b></div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 7 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you have a full week, spend a day and night in Ljubljana and then make your way east for a night to the wine-making area around <b>Maribor</b> and <b>Ptuj.</b> Return to the capital, and then head north for the beauty of the Alps, as outlined in the five-day itinerary.

The 90-minute walking tour of the two chilly main chambers—the Silent Cave and the Murmuring Cave—winds past otherworldly dripstone sculptures, massive sinkholes, and stalactites and stalagmites that resemble the horns of some mythic creature. The highlight is Europe\'s largest cave hall, a gorge 479 feet high, 404 feet wide, and 984 feet long, spanned by a narrow bridge lighted with footlights.

The opulence of the state rooms open to the public provides plenty of wow factor, and don\'t forget the collection of china and carriages at the Queen\'s Gallery and Royal Mews next door.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">St. Paul\'s Cathedral</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">No matter how many times you have been before, the scale and elegance of Sir Christopher Wren\'s masterpiece never fail to take the breath away. Climb the enormous dome, third largest in the world, to experience the freaky acoustics of the Whispering Gallery, and higher still for fantastic views across London.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Tower of London</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Tower is London at its majestic, idiosyncratic best. This is truly the heart of the kingdom—with foundations dating back nine centuries, every brick tells a story, and the ax-blows and fortunes that have risen and fallen within this turreted mini-city provide an inexhaustible supply of intrigue.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">British Museum</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you want to journey through time and space without leaving the confines of Bloomsbury, a visit to the British Museum holds hours of eye-catching artifacts from the world\'s greatest civilizations, including the Elgin Marbles, the Rosetta Stone, and the Sutton Hoo treasure.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shakespeare\'s Globe Theatre</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You can catch a Shakespeare play almost every night of the year in London. But standing on a floor of leaves and sawdust in a painstakingly re-created version of the galleried Tudor theater for which he wrote is a special thrill.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hampton Court Palace</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This collection of buildings and gardens so captivated Henry VIII that it became his favorite royal residence. Its Tudor charm, augmented by Wren\'s touch, and a picturesque upstream Thames location make it a great day out—not even dour Oliver Cromwell, who moved here in 1653, could resist its charms.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Tate Modern</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">More of an event than the average museum visit, Tate Modern, housed inside a striking 1930s power station, is a hip, immensely successful addition to the London gallery landscape. Passing judgment on the latest controversial temporary exhibit inside the giant turbine hall has become almost a civic duty among art-loving Londoners.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">National Gallery</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whatever the collective noun is for a set of old masters—a palette? a canvas?—there are enough here to have the most casual art enthusiast cooing with admiration.

During the mid-\'80s, the financial City deregulated and broke its boundaries socially, geographically—spreading east to Docklands—and architecturally, too. New buildings surged upward between the traditional classic pillars of Wren and Soane. Richard Rogers was responsible for the strident, iconic Lloyds building in 1986, although the sexiness stakes have been upped by Sir Norman Foster, whose recent portfolio includes the groundbreaking \"Gherkin,\" the pickle-shape tower for the Swiss Re headquarters (30 St. Mary Axe) in 2003, and, on the vegetable theme again, the mushroom-shape City Hall for the London Assembly headquarters by Tower Bridge in 2002. Other architects have complemented rather than outshone their neighbors, such as Stirling, who designed No. 1 Poultry to work with the surrounding Wren, Hawksmoor, and Lutyens designs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The millennium celebrations also inspired many updates for old institutions, such as Norman Foster\'s awesome glass roofing and design of the Great Court at the British Museum. Glass is featured again in Rick Mather\'s revamp of the Maritime Museum and the Wallace Collection, and likewise in Dixon-Jones\'s internal face-lift at the National Portrait Gallery and overhaul of the Royal Opera House. Richard Rogers broke the mold with the architecturally interesting if politically</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">controversial Millennium Dome (now under new ownership and known as The 02), and not to be forgotten are other stars of the millennium: the bridges and the wheel. Foster\'s sculpted \"blade of light\" pedestrian footbridge had a wobbly beginning, but is now a firm attraction (at the doorstep of the tremendous Tate Modern power station makeover by Herzog &amp; de Meuron). The Hungerford Bridge by Lifschutz Davidson from Charing Cross to the South Bank Arts Centre crept into the post-millennium, but is no less dazzling. The London Eye observation wheel by David Marks and Julia Barfield was almost eclipsed by the publicity surrounding the Dome downriver, yet it opened on time to spectacular success—and remains a tourist magnet and landmark on the constantly regenerating London horizon.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The next distinctive architectural project on the cards is the wedge-shape \"Shard,\" designed by Italian Renzo Piano. At a height of 1,016 feet it will be London\'s tallest building on its projected completion in 2012.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It\'s an appropriate design, for within these walls lie more than 70 million different specimens. Only a small percentage is on public display, but you could still spend a day here and not come close to seeing everything. The museum is full of cutting-edge exhibits, with all the wow-power and interactives necessary to secure interest from younger visitors.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Highlights</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A giant diplodocus skeleton dominates the vaulted, cathedral-like entrance hall, affording you perhaps the most irresistible photo opportunity in the building. It\'s just a cast, but the <b>Dinosaur Gallery</b> (Gallery 21) contains plenty of real-life dino bones, fossils—and some extremely long teeth. You\'ll also come face to face with a giant animatronic Tyrannosaurus rex—who is programmed to sense when human prey is near and \"respond\" in character. When he does, you can hear the shrieks of fear and delight all the way across the room.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A dizzyingly tall escalator takes you into a giant globe at the <b>Earth Galleries</b>, where there\'s a choice of levels—and Earth surfaces—to explore. Don\'t leave without checking out the earthquake simulation in Gallery 61.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The centerpiece of a major expansion is the new Darwin Centre, built to house some of the (literally) millions of items they don\'t have room to display, including \"Archie,\" a 28.3-foot giant squid.

Tube:South Kensington. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Westminster Abbey</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A monument to the nation\'s rich—and often bloody and scandalous—history, the abbey rises on the Thames skyline as one of London\'s most iconic sites. The mysterious gloom of the lofty medieval interior is home to more than 600 statues, tombs, and commemorative tablets. About 3,300 people, from kings to composers to wordsmiths, are buried in the abbey. It has been the scene of 14 royal weddings and no fewer than 38 coronations—the first in 1066, when William the Conqueror was made king here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There\'s only one way around the abbey, and as there will almost certainly be a long stream of shuffling tourists at your heels, you\'ll need to be alert to catch the highlights. Enter by the north door then, turn around and look up to see the <b>painted-glass rose window</b>, the largest of its kind.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As you walk east towards the apse you\'ll see the <b>Coronation Chair</b>, at the foot of the Henry VII Chapel, which has been briefly graced by nearly every regal posterior since Edward I ordered it in 1301. Look for the graffiti on the back of the Coronation chair. It\'s the work of 18th- and 19th-century visitors and Westminster schoolboys who carved their names there. Further along, the <b>Chapel of Henry VII</b> contains the tombs of Henry VII and his queen, Elizabeth of York. Close by are monuments to the young daughters of James I, and an urn purported to hold the remains of the so-called Princes in the Tower—Edward V and Richard. Interestingly, arch enemies Elizabeth I and her half-sister Mary Tudor share a tomb here. An inscription reads: \"Partners both in throne and grave, here rest two sisters, Elizabeth and Mary, in the hope of the Resurrection.\" In front of the <b>High Altar</b>, which was used for the funerals of Princess Diana and the Queen Mother, is a black-and-white marble pavement laid in 1268. The intricate Italian Cosmati work contains three Latin inscriptions, one of which states that the world will last for 19,683 years.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Continue through the South Ambulatory to the <b>Chapel of St. Edward the Confessor</b>, which contains the shrine to the pre-Norman king. Because of its great age, you must join a tour with the verger to be admitted to the chapel. (Details are available at the admission desk; there is a small extra charge.)</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the left, you\'ll find <b>Poets\' Corner</b>. Geoffrey Chaucer was the first poet to be buried here in 1400. Other memorials include: William Shakespeare, William Blake, John Milton, Jane Austen, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, and Charles Dickens. A door from the south transept and south choir aisle leads to the calm of the <b>Great Cloisters</b>.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The nearby medieval <b>Chapter House</b> is adorned with 14th-century frescoes. The King\'s Council met here between 1257 and 1547. Be sure to look at the floor, one of the finest surviving tiled floors in the country. Take a left out of the Chapter House to visit the <b>Abbey Museum</b>, which houses a collection of deliciously macabre effigies made from the death masks and actual clothing of Charles II and Admiral Lord Nelson (complete with eye patch). Past the museum, the <b>Little Cloister</b> is a quiet haven, and just beyond, the <b>College Garden</b> is a delightful diversion. Filled with medicinal herbs, it has been tended by monks for more than 900 years. On the west side of the abbey, the <b>Dean\'s Yard</b> is the best spot for a fine view of the massive flying buttresses above.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Continue back to the nave of the abbey. In the choir screen, north of the entrance to the choir, is a marble <b>monument to Sir Isaac Newton</b>. If you walk towards the West Entrance, you\'ll see <b>a plaque to Franklin D.

Tube:Westminster. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Tower Bridge</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Despite its medieval, fairy-tale appearance, this is a Victorian youngster. Constructed of steel, then clothed in Portland stone, the Horace Jones masterpiece was deliberately styled in the Gothic persuasion to complement the Tower next door, and it\'s famous for its enormous bascules—the 1,200-ton \"arms,\" which open to allow large ships through. This still happens occasionally, but when river traffic was dense, the bascules were raised about five times a day.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Tower Bridge Exhibition</b> is a child-friendly tour where you can discover how one of the world\'s most famous bridges actually works and then head out onto the walkways for the wonderful city views. First, take in the romance of the panoramas from the east and west walkways between those grand turrets. On the east are the modern superstructures and ships of Docklands, and on the west is the best look at the steel-and-glass \"futuristic mushroom\" that is Greater London Assembly\'s City Hall, the Tower of London, St. Paul\'s, and the Monument. Then it\'s back down to explore the Victorian engine rooms and discover the inner workings, which you learn about through hands-on displays and films. www.towerbridge.org.uk. COST: £6. OPEN: Daily Apr.-Sept., 10-6:30; Oct.-Mar. 9:30-5:30; last admission 30 min before closing time. Tube:Tower Hill. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">St. Paul\'s Cathedral</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The symbolic heart of London, St. Paul\'s may take your breath away, even more so now that it\'s been spruced up for its 300th anniversary in 2008. The dome—the world\'s third largest—peeps through the skyline from many an angle around London. The structure is Sir Christopher Wren\'s masterpiece, completed in 1710 after 35 years of building, and, much later, miraculously spared (mostly) by World War II bombs. Wren\'s first plan, known as the New Model, did not make it past the drawing board. The second, known as the Great Model got as far as the 20-foot oak rendering before it also was rejected. You can see it displayed in the Trophy Room if you take the <b>Triforium Tour</b> (tel. 020/7246-8357. COST: £14. OPEN: Mon. and Tues. at 11:30 and 2, Fri. at 2), a tour that also offers entry to the crypt and galleries The third was accepted, with the fortunate coda that the architect be allowed to make changes as he saw fit. Without that, there would be no dome, because the approved design had a steeple. When you enter and see the dome from the inside, it may seem smaller than you expected. It <i>is</i> smaller, and 60 feet lower than the lead-covered outer dome. Beneath the lantern is Wren\'s famous epitaph, which his son composed and had set into the pavement, and which reads succinctly: Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice—\"Reader, if you seek his monument, look around you.\" The epitaph also appears on Wren\'s memorial in the Crypt. Up 163 spiral steps is the <b>Whispering Gallery,</b> an acoustic phenomenon; you whisper something to the wall on one side, and a second later it transmits clearly to the other side, 107 feet away. Ascend to the <b>Stone Gallery,</b> which encircles the base of the dome. Farther up (280 feet from ground level) is the small <b>Golden Gallery,</b> the dome\'s highest point. From both these galleries (if you have a head for heights) you can walk outside for a spectacular panorama of London. The climb up the spiraling steps can be fun for older kids.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The remains of the poet John Donne, who was dean of St. Paul\'s for his final 10 years (he died in 1631), are in the south choir aisle. The vivacious choir-stall carvings nearby are the work of Grinling Gibbons, as are those on the <b>great organ</b>, which Wren designed. Behind the high altar is the <b>American Memorial Chapel,</b> dedicated to the 28,000 GIs stationed in the United Kingdom who lost their lives in World War II. Among the famous figures whose remains lie in the <b>Crypt</b> are the Duke of Wellington and Admiral Lord Nelson. The Crypt also has a gift shop and a café. www.stpauls.co.uk.

The gallery fills the north side of the square, with Nelson\'s column in the center.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Highlights</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This brief selection is your jumping-off point, but there are hundreds more, enough to fill a full day. In chronological order: (1) <b>Van Eyck</b> (circa 1395-1441), <i>The Arolfini Portrait</i>—a solemn couple holds hands, the fish-eye mirror behind them mysteriously illuminating what can\'t be seen from the front view. (2) <b>Holbein</b> (1497-1543), <i>The Ambassadors</i>—two wealthy visitors from France are depicted surrounded by what were considered luxury goods at the time, such as musical instruments, a book of mathematics, and items for studying astronomy. (3) <b>Botticelli</b> (1445-1510), <i>Venus and Mars</i>—Mars sleeps, exhausted by the love goddess, oblivious to the lance weilded by mischievous cherubs. (4) <b>Leonardo da Vinci</b> (1452-1519), <i>The Virgin and Child</i>—this haunting black-chalk cartoon is partly famous for having been attacked at gunpoint, and it now gets extra protection behing glass. (5) <b>Caravaggio</b> (1573-1610), <i>The Supper at Emmaus</i>—a cinematically lightened, freshly resurrected Christ blesses bread in an astonishingly domestic vision from the master of chiaroscuro. (6) <b>Constable</b> (1776-1837), <i>The Hay Wain</i>—rendered overfamiliar by too many greeting cards, this is the definitive image of golden-age rural England. (7) <b>Turner</b> (1775-1851), <i>The Fighting Téméraire</i>—the final voyage of the great French bettleship into a livid, hazy sunset. (8) <b>Seurat</b> (1859-91), <i>Bathers at Asnières</i>—this static summer day\'s idyll is one of the pointillist extraordinaire\'s best-known works.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tips</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Color coding throughout the galleries helps you keep track of the period you\'re immersed in.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Begin at an \"Art Start\" terminal in the Sainsbury Wing or East Wing Espresso Bar.

But when the Queen heads off to Scotland on her annual summer holiday (you can tell because the Union Jack flies above the palace instead of the Royal Standard), the palace\'s 19 State Rooms open up to visitors (although the north wing\'s private apartments remain behind closed doors). With fabulous gilt moldings and walls adorned with masterpieces by Rembrandt, Rubens, and other old masters, the State Rooms are the grandest of the palace\'s 775 rooms.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Highlights</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Inside the palace, the <b>Grand Hall,</b> followed by the <b>Grand Staircase</b> and <b>Guard Room,</b> gives a taste of what\'s to follow: marble, gold leaf galore, and massive, twinkling chandeliers. Don\'t miss the theatrical <b>Throne Room,</b> with the original 1953 coronation throne, or the sword in <b>The Ballroom,</b> used by the Queen to bestow knighthoods and other honors. Royal portraits line the <b>State Dining Room,</b> and the <b>Blue Drawing Room</b> is splendor in overdrive. The bow-shape <b>Music Room</b> features lapis lazuli columns between arched floor-to-ceiling windows, and the alabaster-and-gold plasterwork of the<b> White Drawing Room</b> is a suitable crescendo on which to end the tour.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Changing the Guard,</b> also known as <b>Guard Mounting,</b> remains one of London\'s best free shows and culminates in front of the palace. Marching to live bands, the old guard proceeds up the Mall from St. James\'s Palace to Buckingham Palace. Shortly afterward, the new guard approaches from Wellington Barracks. Then within the forecourt, the captains of the old and new guards symbolically transfer the keys to the palace.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tips</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Admission is by timed ticket with entry every 15 minutes throughout the day.

Tube:Victoria, St. James\'s Park, Green Park. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">British Museum</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With a facade like a great temple, this celebrated treasure house, filled with plunder of incalculable value and beauty from around the globe, occupies a ponderous Greco-Victorian building that makes a suitably grand impression. Inside are some of the greatest relics of humankind: the Elgin Marbles, the Rosetta Stone, the Sutton Hoo Treasure—almost everything, it seems, but the Ark of the Covenant. The three rooms that comprise the <b>Sainsbury African</b> Galleries are a must-see in the Lower Gallery—together they present 200,000 objects, highlighting such ancient kingdoms as the Benin and Asante. The museum\'s focal point is the <b>Great Court</b>, a brilliant techno-classical design with a vast glass roof that reveals the museum\'s most well-kept secret—an inner courtyard. The revered <b>Reading Room</b> has a blue-and-gold dome and over 100,000 ancient tomes. If you want to navigate the highlights of the almost 100 galleries, join the free <b>eyeOpener</b> 30- to 40-minute tours by museum guides (details at the information desk).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The collection began when Sir Hans Sloane, physician to Queen Anne and George II, bequeathed his personal collection of antiquities to the nation. It grew quickly, thanks to enthusiastic kleptomaniacs after the Napoleonic Wars—most notoriously the seventh Earl of Elgin, who acquired the marbles from the Parthenon and Erechtheion in Athens during his term as British ambassador in Constantinople. Here follows a highly edited résumé (in order of encounter) of the British Museum\'s greatest hits: close to the entrance hall, in Room 4, is the <b>Rosetta Stone,</b> found by French soldiers in 1799, and carved in 196 BC by decree of Ptolemy V in Egyptian hieroglyphics, demotic (a cursive script developed in Egypt), and Greek. This inscription provided the French Egyptologist Jean-François Champollion with the key to deciphering hieroglyphics. Also in Room 4 is the Colossal statue of Ramesses II, a 7-ton likeness of this member of the 19th dynasty\'s (ca. 1270 BC) upper half. Maybe the <b>Eglin Marbles</b> should be back in Greece, but while the debate rages on, you can steal your own moment with them in Room 18, west of the entrance in the Parthenon Galleries. Carved in about 400 BC, these graceful decorations are displayed along with a high-tech exhibit of the Acropolis. Be sure to stop in the Enlightenment Gallery in Room 1 to see the contents of the British Museum\'s first collections. Also in the West Wing is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World—in fragment form—in Room 21: the <b>Mausoleum of Halikarnassos.</b> The <b>JP Morgan Chase North American Gallery</b> (Room 26) has one of the largest collections of native culture outside North America, going back to the earliest hunters 10,000 years ago. Next door, the <b>Mexican Gallery</b> holds such alluring pieces as the 15th century turquoise mask of Xiuhtecuhtli, the Mexican Fire God and Turquoise Lord. The World Cultures Galleries in Room 24 holds <b>Cradle to the Grave</b>, an installation by a collective of artists and a doctor, displays more than 14,000 drugs (the number estimated to be prescribed to every person in the U.K. in his lifetime) in a colorful tapestry of pills and tablets.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Upstairs are some of the most popular galleries, especially beloved by children: Rooms 62-63, where the <b>Egyptian mummies</b> live. Nearby are the glittering 4th-century <b>Mildenhall Treasure</b> and the equally splendid 8th-century Anglo-Saxon <b>Sutton Hoo Treasure</b> (with magnificent helmets and jewelry). A more prosaic exhibit is that of Pete Marsh, sentimentally named by the archaeologists who unearthed the <b>Lindow Man</b> from a Cheshire peat marsh; poor Pete was ritually slain in the 1st century, and lay perfectly pickled in his bog until 1984. The <b>Korean Foundation Gallery</b> (Room 67) delves into the art and archaeology of the country, including a reconstruction of a sarangbang, a traditional scholar\'s study. www.thebritishmuseum.org.

Crossings into the eastern frontier town of Myawady give a brief taste of Myanmar, but with no safe access routes incountry, return to Thailand is unavoidable. The border is open daily 8-6. No visa is required, but you will be required to pay a B500 fee upon arrival in Myanmar, and you\'ll have to leave your passport with the border officials for the entire duration of your stay. Myawady is quite a change from Thailand, noticeable as soon as you cross: men wearing sarongs, women and children with their faces colored in sun-screening chalk, and unpaved streets will welcome you to this less developed land. Warm welcomes in English greet you, too, along with motorbikes with homemade sidecars. Guided tours of the nominal attractions here, which can be arranged either at one of the tourist agencies that cluster on the Thai side of the border or through one of the taxi drivers on the other side, are fairly cheap at around B500. They\'ll take you to the Shwe Muay Wan, the city\'s most prominent temple; to a hilltop monastery where, if you time it right, you might be invited to lunch with the monks; and to the uniquely shaped crocodile temple, the Myikyaungon. The town occasionally erupts into a political flash point as the KNU slug it out with the Yangon-based government, sometimes resulting in the temporary closure of the bridge, but this hasn\'t happened in a while. The crossing is absolutely worthwhile, and not to be missed if you\'re in Mae Sot. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Thee Lor Su Waterfall</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Considered one of Southeast Asia\'s most spectacular falls and Thailand\'s largest, Thee Lor Su Waterfall is in the Umphang Wildlife Conservation Area. The valley\'s river, tracking its way from Huai Klotho, cascades down a 984-foot limestone cliff into a green translucent pool; the clearing is surrounded by virgin mountain forest. The waterfall is a 30-minute walk from the conservation area\'s headquarters. Note that though the conservation area is open year-round, the best time to go rafting is during the rainy season from July through October. Rafting tours are the most rewarding means of seeing Thee Lor Su and its surrounding area, with programs readily available from agents in Umphang, as well as in Mae Sot. COST: B300.

What\'s certain is that the fast food in L.A. tastes better than fast food elsewhere. For burgers—the original signature food of the metropolis—there are a couple chains worth noting. Cars line up at all hours at <b>In-N-Out Burger</b> (www.in-n-out.com many locations), still a family-owned operation (and very possibly America\'s original drive-thru) whose terrific made-to-order burgers are revered by Angelenos. Visitors may recognize the chain as the infamous spot where Paris Hilton got nabbed for drunk driving, but locals are more concerned with getting their burger fix off the \"secret\" menu with variations like \"Animal style\" (mustard-grilled patty with grilled onions and extra spread) or a \"4x4\" (four burger patties and four cheese slices for heavy eaters). The company\'s Web site lists explanations for other popular secret menu items.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Tommy\'s</b> sells a delightfully sloppy chili burger; the original location (2575 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles 90057 213/389-9060) is a no-frills culinary landmark. For rotisserie chicken that will make you forget the Colonel forever, head to <b>Zankou Chicken</b> (5065 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood 90028 323/665-7845 www.zankouchicken.com), a small chain noted for its golden crispy-skinned birds, potent garlic sauce, and Armenian specialties. Homesick New Yorkers will appreciate <b>Jerry\'s Famous Deli</b> (10925 Weyburn Ave., Westwood 90024 310/208-3354 www.jerrysfamousdeli.com), where the massive menu includes all the classic deli favorites. With a lively bar scene, good barbecued ribs, contemporary takes on old favorites, and even sushi, the more upscale <b>Houston\'s</b> (202 Wilshire Blvd., Santa Monica 90401 310/576-7558 www.hillstone.com) is a popular local hangout. And <b>Señor Fish</b> (422 E. 1st St., Downtown 90012 213/625-0566 www.senor-fish.com) is known for its healthy Mexican seafood specialties, such as scallop burritos and ceviche tostadas.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">L.A.\'s Best Beaches</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most Los Angeles beaches are pretty spectacular, but some are better suited for certain activities and people than others. Here\'s a longtime beachgoer\'s breakdown, quality by quality.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Best All-Around Beach:</b> Santa Monica. A wide swath of sand, plenty of people-watching, good swimming, great views from the bluffs—other than its surfing (nil), this beach hits the key marks.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Best Activities:</b> Redondo and Zuma. Both have volleyball, snorkeling, and fishing. Zuma has a playground, while Redondo\'s got a pier with places to eat and shop.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Easiest Parking:</b> Venice at Ocean Front Walk, at the west end of Rose Avenue.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Best for People-Watching:</b> Venice City Beach, for its boardwalk, volleyball courts, and nonstop parade of characters. Runner-up: Manhattan Beach, though the people are more cookie-cutter.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Best for Kids:</b> Mother\'s Beach/Marina del Rey. A protected lagoon, barbecue pits, and a cool playground mean you can easily make a full day of it. If your kids want to go in the water, though, you should check the water conditions first, as pollution\'s been on the rise. In Orange County, Huntington State Beach stands out for its family-friendly facilities and relatively easy parking.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Best Surfing:</b> Malibu Lagoon/Surfrider. The waves are awesomely steady; an annual surfing competition is held here. Looking south to Orange County, the north side of Huntington City Beach is another surfing hot spot with consistent peaks.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Best for Walking:</b> Malibu Lagoon.

But Disneyland, opened in 1955 and the only one of the kingdoms to be overseen by Walt himself, has a genuine historic feel and occupies a unique place in the Disney legend. There\'s plenty here that you won\'t find anywhere else: for example, Storybook Land, with its miniature replicas of animated Disney scenes from classics such as <i>Pinocchio; Alice in Wonderland</i>; and the Indiana Jones Adventure ride.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Characters appear for autographs and photos throughout the day; guidebooks at the entrances give times and places. You can also meet some of the animated icons at one of the character meals served at the three Disney hotels (open to the public). Belongings can be stored in lockers just off Main Street; purchases can also be sent to the package pickup desk, at the front of the park. Main Street stays open an hour after the attractions close, so you may want to save your shopping for the end of your visit. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Getty Center</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With its curving walls and isolated hilltop perch, the Getty Center resembles a pristine fortified city of its own. You may have been lured up by the beautiful views of L.A. (on a clear day stretching all the way to the Pacific Ocean), but the architecture, uncommon gardens, and fascinating art collections will be more than enough to capture and hold your attention. When the sun is out, the complex\'s rough-cut travertine marble skin seems to soak up the light. You\'ll need to do some advance planning, since parking reservations are sometimes required during vacation periods, but the experience is well worth the effort.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">J. Paul Getty, the billionaire oil magnate and art collector, began collecting Greek and Roman antiquities and French decorative arts in the 1930s. He opened the J. Paul Getty Museum at his Malibu estate in 1954, and in the 1970s, he built a re-creation of an ancient Roman village to house his initial collection. When Getty died in 1976, the museum received an endowment of $700 million that grew to a reported $4.2 billion. The Malibu villa, reopened in 2006, is devoted to the antiquities. The Getty Center, designed by Richard Meier, opened in 1998 and pulled together the rest of the collections, along with the museum\'s affiliated research, conservation, and philanthropic institutes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Getting to the center involves a bit of anticipatory lead-up. At the base of the hill, a pavilion disguises the underground parking structure. From there you either walk or take a smooth, computer-driven tram up the steep slope, checking out the Bel Air estates across the humming 405 freeway. The five pavilions that house the museum surround a central courtyard and are bridged by walkways. From the courtyard, plazas, and walkways, you can survey the city from the San Gabriel Mountains to the ocean.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In a ravine separating the museum and the Getty Research Institute, conceptual artist Robert Irwin created the playful <b>Central Garden</b> in stark contrast to Meier\'s mathematical architectural geometry. The garden\'s design is what Hollywood feuds are made of: Meier couldn\'t control Irwin\'s vision, and the two men sniped at each other during construction, with Irwin stirring the pot with every loose twist his garden path took. The result is a refreshing garden walk whose focal point is an azalea maze (some insist the Mickey Mouse shape is on purpose) in a reflecting pool.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Inside the pavilions are the galleries for the permanent collections of European paintings, drawings, sculpture, illuminated manuscripts, and decorative arts, as well as American and European photographs. The Getty\'s collection of French furniture and decorative arts, especially from the early years of Louis XIV (1643-1715) to the end of the reign of Louis XVI (1774-92), is renowned for its quality and condition; you can see a pair of completely reconstructed salons. In the paintings galleries, a computerized system of louvered skylights allows natural light to filter in, creating a closer approximation of the conditions in which the artists painted. Notable among the paintings are Rembrandt\'s <i>The Abduction of Europa,</i> Van Gogh\'s <i>Irises,</i> Monet\'s <i>Wheatstack, Snow Effects,</i> and <i>Morning,</i> and James Ensor\'s <i>Christ\'s Entry into Brussels.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you want to start with a quick overview, pick up the brochure in the entrance hall that guides you to 15 highlights of the collection. There\'s also an instructive audio tour ($5) with commentaries by art historians. Art information rooms with multimedia computer stations contain more details about the collections. The Getty also presents lectures, films, concerts, and special programs for kids and families. The complex includes an upscale restaurant and downstairs cafeteria with panoramic window views, and two outdoor coffee bar cafes. On-site parking is subject to availability and usually fills up by late afternoon on holidays and summer weekends, so try to come early in the day. You may also take public transportation (MTA Bus 561 or Santa Monica Big Blue Bus 14). www.getty.edu. COST: Free, parking $8.

It\'s inside the Max Factor Building, purchased in 1928. Factor\'s famous makeup was made on the top floors and a glamorous salon was hosted on the ground floor. After its renovation, this art deco landmark now holds more than 10,000 bits of film memorabilia. The extensive exhibits inside include those dedicated to Marilyn Monroe and Bob Hope and to costumes and set props from such films as <i>Moulin Rouge, The Silence of the Lambs,</i> and <i>Planet of the Apes.</i> There\'s an impressive gallery of photos showing movie stars frolicking at such venues as the Brown Derby, Ciro\'s, the Trocadero, and the Mocambo. Hallway walls are covered with the stunning autograph collection of ultimate fan Joe Ackerman; aspiring filmmakers will want to check out an exhibit of early film equipment. The museum\'s showpiece, however, is the Max Factor exhibit, where separate dressing rooms are dedicated to Factor\'s \"color harmony\": creating distinct looks for \"brownettes\" (Factor\'s term), redheads, and of course, bombshell blondes. You can practically smell the peroxide of Marilyn Monroe getting her trademark platinum look here. You can also spy the actual makeup cases owned by Lucille Ball, Lana Turner, Ginger Rogers, Bette Davis, Rita Hayworth, and others who made the makeup as glamorous as the starlets who wore it. www.thehollywoodmuseum.com.

Hollywood\'s <b>Pacific Design Center.</b> Likewise, its exhibitions are split between the established and the cutting-edge. Heavy hitters such as Mark Rothko, Franz Kline, Susan Rothenberg, Diane Arbus, and Robert Frank are part of the permanent collection thatis rotated into the museum exhibits at different times, while at least 20 theme shows are featured annually. It\'s a good idea to check the schedule in advance, since some shows sell out, especially on weekends. The museum occasionally closes for exhibit installation. www.moca.org. COST: Grand Ave. and Geffen Contemporary $10, free Thurs. 5-8; Pacific Design Center free. OPEN: Mon. and Fri. 11-5, Thurs. 11-8, weekends 11-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Petersen Automotive Museum</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You don\'t have to be a gearhead to appreciate this building full of antique and unusual cars. The Petersen is likely to be one of the coolest museums in town with its take on some of the most unusual creations on wheels and rotating exhibits of the icons who drove them. Lifelike dioramas and street scenes spread through the ground floor help to establish a local context for the history of the automobile. The second floor may include displays of Hollywood-celebrity and movie cars,\"muscle\" cars (like a 1969 Dodge Daytona 440 Magnum), alternative-powered cars, motorcycles, and a showcase of the Ferrari. You\'ll also learn about the origins of our modern-day car-insurance system, as well as the history of L.A.\'s formidable freeway network. A children\'s interactive Discovery Center illustrates the mechanics of the automobile and fun child-inspired creations; there are also a gift shop and a research library. www.petersen.org. COST: $10. OPEN: Tues.-Sun. 10-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Robert H. Meyer Memorial State Beach</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Part of Malibu\'s most beautiful coastal area, this beach is made up of three minibeaches: El Pescador, La Piedra, and El Matador—all with the same spectacular view. Scramble down the steps to the rocky coves where nude sunbathers sometimes gather—although in recent years, police have been cracking down. \"El Mat\" has a series of caves, Piedra some nifty rock formations, and Pescador a secluded feel; but they\'re all picturesque and fairly private. One warning: watch the incoming tide and don\'t get trapped between those otherwise scenic boulders. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA)</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Serving as the focal point of the museum district along Wilshire Boulevard, LACMA\'s vast, encyclopedic collection of more than 100,000 objects dating from ancient times to the present is widely considered one of the most comprehensive in the western United States. Since opening in 1965 the museum has grown from three buildings to seven, stretching across a 20-acre campus. As part of an ambitious 10-year facelift plan that is becoming a work of art on its own, entitled \"Transformation,\" the museum is on a mission to integrate the seven buildings and outdoor spaces into a coherent whole. Phase one began with the opening of the impressive Broad Contemporary Art Museum (BCAM) in early 2008. With three vast floors, BCAM\'s purpose is to more fully integrate contemporary art into LACMA\'s program and explore the interplay art of current times with that of the past.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The museum space is now making better use of its courtyard space, before merely a long walk from one building to the next, the setting now makes use of the adjacent park to provide tranquil places to sit and \"take it all in,\" and an installment of Chris Burden\'s \"Urban Light\" project, that consists of 202 antique cast-iron lampposts from around Los Angeles, showcases the way the city designed street lamps to reflect the identity of each area. The playful exhibit beckons young and old alike to walk through their maze of towering light.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With rotating displays from its permanent collection, at any time it\'s possible to see items from LACMA\'s abundant holdings of works by leading Latin American artists including Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, prominent Southern California artists, collections of Islamic and European art, paintings by Henri Matisse and Rene Magritte, as well as works by Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky who taught at Germany\'s Bauhaus school in the 1920s, art representing the ancient civilizations of Egypt, the Near East, Greece and Rome, plus a vast costume and textiles collection dating back to the 16th century. American Art, as well as art from Latin America and special exhibitions are on view in the \"Art of Americas\" building.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Pavilion for Japanese Art showcases scrolls, screens, drawings, paintings, textiles, and decorative arts from Japan; it\'s a particularly peaceful space, with natural light and a fountain on the ground floor that fills the building with the sound of flowing water. The Bing Center holds a research library, resource center, and film theater.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Boone\'s Children\'s Gallery on the soon-to-be \"transformed\" LACMA West end maintains an art-making mission through classes, interactive displays, and brightly colored decor.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The museumorganizes special exhibitions and host major traveling shows. Temporary exhibits sometimes require tickets purchased in advance, so check the calendar ahead of time. www.lacma.org. COST: $12, free 2nd Tues. of month, after 5 policy: \"pay what you wish\".

But judging from the swarms of visitors and the standing-room-only holiday masses, the church has carved out a niche for itself in Downtown\'s daily life. Opened in 2002, the ocher-concrete cathedral looms up by the Hollywood Freeway. The plaza in front is relatively austere, glaringly bright on sunny days; a children\'s play garden with bronze animals helps relieve the stark space. Imposing bronze entry doors, designed by local artist Robert Graham, are decorated with multicultural icons and New World images of the Virgin Mary. The canyonlike interior of the church is spare, polished, and airy. By day, sunlight illuminates the sanctuary through translucent curtain walls of thin Spanish alabaster, a departure from the usual stained glass. Artist John Nava used residents from his hometown of Ojai, California, as models for some of the 135 figures in the tapestries that line the nave walls. Make sure to go underground to wander the bright, somewhat incongruous, mazelike white-marble corridors of the mausoleum. Free guided tours start at the entrance fountain at 1 on weekdays. There\'s plenty of underground visitor parking; the vehicle entrance is on Hill Street. The café in the plaza has become one of Downtown\'s favorite lunch spots, as you can pick up a fresh, reasonably priced meal to eat at one of the outdoor tables. www.olacathedral.org. COST: Free, parking $3 every 20 min, $14 maximum. OPEN: Weekdays 6:30-6, Sat. 9-6, Sun. 7-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rodeo Drive</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The ultimate shopping indulgence—Rodeo Drive is one of Southern California\'s bona fide tourist attractions. The art of window-shopping is prime among the retail elite: Tiffany &amp; Co., Gucci, Jimmy Choo, Valentino, Harry Winston, Prada... you get the picture. Several nearby restaurants have patios where you can sip a drink while watching career shoppers in their size 2 threads saunter by with shopping bags stuffed with superfluous delights. At the southern end of Rodeo Drive (at Wilshire Boulevard), <b>Via Rodeo,</b> a curvy cobblestone street designed to resemble a European shopping area, makes the perfect backdrop to strike a pose for that glamour shot. The holidays bring a special magic to Rodeo and the surrounding streets with twinkling lights, swinging music, and colorful banners. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

As a result, the city allows nearly 2,000 bars and restaurants to create outdoor spaces for enjoying the cooler, dry summer nighttime air while sipping a beer. For formal summer dining, we recommend some of the lovely hotel restaurants, most of which have private and peaceful gardens or roof terraces that avoid the street noise. Possibilities include the Ritz hotel, La Biblioteca del Santo Mauro (at Hotel Santo Mauro), El Jardín de Orfila (at Hotel Orfila), and La Terraza del Casino. Three mid-range restaurants with good terraces are Sacha, Bokado, and Pedro Larumbe—the latter\'s rooftop restaurant turns into one of Madrid\'s most fashionable terraces at night. If you just want to grab a bite or an early-evening drink, drop by La Latina neighborhood, especially Plaza de la Paja or Plaza de San Andrés, across from the Church of San Andrés, or sit on any of the terraces at Plaza de Olavide, an enclave favored mostly by locals, near Malasaña and the Bilbao subway stop. Plaza Santa Ana is a pricier, more touristy alternative. Plaza Chueca, in the neighborhood of the same name, along with the Mercado de Fuencarral (halfway between Gran Vía and Tribunal), the Plaza de 2 de Mayo, and the Plaza de las Comendadoras in the Malasaña neighborhood are always bustling and crowded with younger people. The best nightlife is along the terraces on Castellana, at Terraza Atenas on Calle Segovia, and at the hotel rooftop bars that have spread out in the last few years: Hotel Urban, ME Reina Victoria, Silken Puerta de América, De las Letras, and Room Mate Óscar.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Events of May 2nd</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1808 Spain was ruled by Carlos IV, a king more interested in hunting than in the duties attached to government. The king delegated power to his wife, María Luisa, and she to the chief minister, Godoy, one of the country\'s most despised statesmen of all time. Godoy succeeded in tripling the country\'s debt in 20 years, and signed the secret Convention of Fontainebleau with Napoléon, which allowed the French troops to freely cross Spain on their way to Portugal. Napoléon\'s plans were different—he intended to use the convention as an excuse to annex Spain to his vast domains. While the French troops entered Spain, the Spanish people, tired of the inept king and the greedy Godoy, revolted against the French in Aranjuez on March 17, 1808, hoping Napoléon would hand the throne over to the king\'s elder son, Prince Ferdinand. In the following days Carlos IV abdicated, and his son was proclaimed the new king, Fernando VII. Napoléon had already chosen a person for that job, though—one of his brothers, José Bonaparte. The shrewd French emperor managed to attract the Spanish royal family to France and had Carlos IV, his wife, and Ferdinand VII imprisoned in Bayona, France, and his brother placed on the Spanish throne.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When French General Murat arrived in Madrid a few days later, on March 23, 1808, with 10,000 men (leaving 20,000 more camped outside the city) following Napoléon\'s orders, Madrid\'s Captain General Francisco Javier Negrete ordered the Spanish troops to remain in their military quarters, arguing that resistance was futile. On the morning of May 2, a raging group of civilians revolted in front of the Palacio Real, fearing the French troops intended to send Francisco de Paula, King Carlos IV\'s youngest son, to Bayona with his brother and father. Gunfire ensued, and word of the events spread all over the city. People rose up, fighting the mightier French troops with whatever they could use as weapons. Two captains, Daoiz and Velarde, and a lieutenant, Ruiz, disobeyed Negrete\'s orders and quartered at the Monteleón Artillery barracks, which stretched from what is now Plaza de 2 de mayo to Calle Carranza. Helped by a small group of soldiers and some brave citizens who had marched to the barracks from the Royal Palace, the group resisted the French for three hours, doing so with very little ammunition, since they couldn\'t access the armory.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Daoiz and Velarde died in the bloody fight. Ruiz managed to escape, only to die from his wounds later. Murat\'s forces executed soldiers and civilians throughout the city, including in the Casa de Campo and what\'s now the Parque del Oeste, captured by Goya in one of his two famous paintings of the executions—both restored in 2008 to celebrate the bicentennial of the events. The events marked the beginning of the five-year War of Independence against the French.

This ambitious collection of almost 1,000 paintings traces the history of Western art with examples from every important movement, from the 13th-century Italian Gothic through 20th-century American pop art. The works were gathered from the 1920s to the 1980s by Swiss industrialist Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza and his father. At the urging of his wife, the baron donated the entire collection to Spain in 1993. A renovation in 2004 increased the number of paintings on display to include the baron\'s wife\'s personal collection (considered of lesser quality). Critics have described the museum\'s paintings as the minor works of major artists and the major works of minor artists, but, be that as it may, the collection traces the development of Western humanism as no other in the world.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the high points here is Hans Holbein\'s <i>Portrait of Henry VIII</i> (purchased from the late Princess Diana\'s grandfather, who used the money to buy a Bugatti sports car). American artists are also well represented; look for the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington\'s cook, and note how closely the composition and rendering resemble the artist\'s famous painting of the Founding Father. Two halls are devoted to the impressionists and postimpressionists, including many works by Pissarro and a few each by Renoir, Monet, Degas, Van Gogh, and Cézanne. Find Pissarro\'s <i>Saint-Honoré Street in the Afternoon, Effect of Rain</i> for a jolt of mortality, or Renoir\'s <i>Woman with a Parasol in a Garden</i> for a sense of bucolic beauty lost.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Within 20th-century art, the collection is strong on dynamic German expressionism, with some works by Georgia O\'Keeffe and Andrew Wyeth along with Hoppers, Bacons, Rauschenbergs, and Lichtensteins. The temporary exhibits can be fascinating, and in summer, are sometimes open until 11 PM. A rooftop restaurant serving tapas and drinks is open in the summer until past midnight. Note that you can buy tickets in advance online. www.museothyssen.org. COST: Permanent collection EUR 6, temporary exhibition EUR 5, combined EUR 9; EUR 14.40 combined Paseo del Arte (Art Walk) ticket for the Prado, Reina Sofia, and Thyssen-Bornemisza.

The Palace was commissioned in the early 18th century by the first of Spain\'s Bourbon rulers, Felipe V. Outside, you can see the classical French architecture on the graceful <b>Patio de Armas:</b> King Felipe was obviously inspired by his childhood days at Versailles with his grandfather Louis XIV. Look for the stone statues of Inca prince Atahualpa and Aztec king Montezuma, perhaps the only tributes in Spain to these pre-Columbian American rulers. Notice how the steep bluff drops westward to the Manzanares River—on a clear day, this vantage point commands a view of the mountain passes leading into Madrid from Old Castile; it\'s easy to see why the Moors picked this spot for a fortress.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Inside, 2,800 rooms compete with each other for over-the-top opulence. A two-hour guided tour in English winds a mile-long path through the palace; highlights include the <b>Salón de Gasparini,</b> King Carlos III\'s private apartments, with swirling, inlaid floors and curlicued, stucco wall and ceiling decoration, all glistening in the light of a 2-ton crystal chandelier; the <b>Salón del Trono,</b> a grand throne room with the royal seats of King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofía; and the <b>banquet hall,</b> the palace\'s largest room, which seats up to 140 people for state dinners. No monarch has lived here since 1931, when Alfonso XIII was deposed after a republican electoral victory. The current king and queen live in the far simpler Zarzuela Palace on the outskirts of Madrid; this palace is used only for official occasions.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Also worth visiting are the <b>Museo de Música</b> (Music Museum), where five stringed instruments by Stradivarius form the world\'s largest such collection; the <b>Painting Gallery,</b> which displays works by Spanish, Flemish, and Italian artists from the 15th century onward; the <b>Armería Real</b> (Royal Armory), with historic suits of armor and frightening medieval torture implements; and the <b>Real Oficina de Farmacía</b> (Royal Pharmacy), with vials and flasks used to mix the king\'s medicines. COST: EUR 8, guided tour EUR 10; Royal Armory only EUR 3.40; Painting Gallery only EUR 2. OPEN: Apr.-Sept., Mon.-Sat. 9-6, Sun. 9-3; Oct.-Mar., Mon.-Sat. 9:30-5, Sun. 9-2. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museo del Prado</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When the Prado was commissioned by King-Mayor Carlos III, in 1785, it was meant to be a natural-science museum. The king wanted the museum, the adjoining botanical gardens, and the elegant Paseo del Prado to serve as a center of scientific enlightenment. By the time the building was completed in 1819, its purpose had changed to exhibiting the art gathered by Spanish royalty since the time of Ferdinand and Isabella. The museum\'s long-awaited facelift was begun in 2002, and completed after five years of work. It features a massive new wing together with a new building around the remains of the Cloister of the San Jerónimo el Real, designed by Rafael Moneo, that has resurrected long-hidden works by Zurbarán and Pereda and more than double the number of paintings on display from the permanent collection.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Prado\'s jewels are its works by the nation\'s three great masters: Francisco Goya, Diego Velázquez, and El Greco. The museum also holds masterpieces by Flemish, Dutch, German, French, and Italian artists, collected when their lands were part of the Spanish Empire. The museum benefited greatly from the anticlerical laws of 1836, which forced monasteries, convents, and churches to forfeit many of their artworks for public display.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Enter the Prado via the Goya entrance, with steps opposite the Ritz hotel, or by the less-crowded Murillo door opposite the Jardín Botánico. The layout varies (grab a floor plan), but the first halls on the left, coming from the Goya entrance (7A to 11 on the second floor, or <i>planta primera</i>), are usually devoted to <b>17th-century Flemish painters,</b> including Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640), Jacob Jordaens (1593-1678), and Antony van Dyck (1599-1641).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Room 12 introduces you to the meticulous brushwork of <b>Velázquez</b> (1599-1660) in his numerous portraits of kings and queens. Look for the magnificent <i>Las Hilanderas</i> (<i>The Spinners</i>), evidence of the artist\'s talent for painting light. The Prado\'s most famous canvas, Velázquez\'s <i>Las Meninas</i> (<i>The Maids of Honor</i>), combines a self-portrait of the artist at work with a mirror reflection of the king and queen in a revolutionary interplay of space and perspectives. Picasso was obsessed with this work and painted several copies of it in his own abstract style, now on display in the Picasso Museum in Barcelona.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The south ends of the second and top floors (<i>planta primera</i> and <i>planta segunda</i>) are reserved for <b>Goya</b> (1746-1828), whose works span a staggering range of tone, from bucolic to horrific. Among his early masterpieces are portraits of the family of King Carlos IV, for whom he was court painter—one glance at their unflattering and imbecilic expressions, especially in the painting <i>The Family of Carlos IV,</i> reveals the loathing Goya developed for these self-indulgent, reactionary rulers. His famous side-by-side canvases, <i>The Clothed Maja</i> and <i>The Nude Maja,</i> may represent the young duchess of Alba, whom Goya adored and frequently painted. No one knows whether she ever returned his affection. The adjacent rooms house a series of idyllic scenes of Spaniards at play, painted as designs for tapestries.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Goya\'s paintings took on political purpose starting in 1808, when the population of Madrid rose up against occupying French troops. <i>The 2nd of May</i> portrays the insurrection at the Puerta del Sol, and its even more terrifying companion piece, <i>The 3rd of May,</i> depicts the nighttime executions of patriots who had rebelled the day before. The garish light effects in this work typify the romantic style, which favors drama over detail, and make it one of the most powerful indictments of violence ever committed to canvas.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Goya\'s \"black paintings\" are dark, disturbing works, completed late in his life, that reflect his inner turmoil after losing his hearing and his deep embitterment over the bloody War of Independence. These are copies of the monstrous hallucinatory paintings Goya made with marvelously free brushstrokes on the walls of his house by southern Madrid\'s Manzanares River, popularly known as <i>La Quinta del Sordo</i> (the deaf one\'s villa). Having grown gravely ill in his old age, Goya was deaf, lonely, bitter, and despairing; his terrifying <i>Saturn Devouring One of His Sons</i> (which Goya displayed in his dining room!) communicates the ravages of age and time.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Near the Goya entrance, the Prado\'s ground floor (<i>planta baja</i>) is filled with 15th- and 16th-century Flemish paintings, including the bizarre proto-surrealist masterpiece <i>Garden of Earthly Delights,</i> by Hieronymus Bosch (circa 1450-1516). Next come Rooms 60A, 61A, and 62A, filled with the passionately spiritual works of <b>El Greco</b> (Doménikos Theotokópoulos, 1541-1614), the Greek-born artist who lived and worked in Toledo. El Greco is known for his mystical, elongated forms and faces—a style that was shocking to a public accustomed to strictly representational images. Two of his greatest paintings, <i>The Resurrection</i> and <i>The Adoration of the Shepherds,</i> are on view here. Before you leave, stop in the 14th- to 16th-century Italian rooms to see Titian\'s <i>Portrait of Emperor Charles V</i> and Raphael\'s exquisite <i>Portrait of a Cardinal.</i>. www.museodelprado.es.

Even if they do scream \"tourist,\" they\'re a great way to reach your evening meal, and children love riding up front beside the driver. They\'re also picture-perfect for trips out to enjoy the Majorelle, Menara, and Agdal gardens. You should always agree on a price beforehand, but keep in mind that rides generally cost a minimum of 60 DH; trips to the Palmery might cost 300 DH, and round-trip excursions (circling the ramparts, say) might cost 200 DH. There are two main pick-up stops: one is in the medina, along the left side of the street stretching from the Djemâa el Fna to the Koutoubia Mosque; the other is in Guéliz, just south of the Place de la Liberté and west of Bab Nkob. You can also always try flagging one down.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hop On A Bus</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">No, you\'re not in London. There really are red double-decker buses zooming round the city. <b>Marrakech Tour</b> (tel. 024/33-96-37. www.marrakech-tour.com. COST: 130 DH) offers sightseeing galore (including English audio headphones). A 24-hour ticket on these open-top numbers allows you to hop on, off, and back on again whenever you like (they run daily between 9:20 AM and 7 PM). One circuit,\"Marrakech Monumental,\" stops at the main sights, including the two palaces and the Koutoubia mosque, and is particularly useful for the Menara Gardens, a little way out of town. The other circuit,\"Marrakech Romantique,\" takes you to the Palmery—a good bet for the Majorelle Gardens or the Palmery Golf Palace. You can pick up a bus at any of the many stopping-off points, but both stop at Place de la Liberté by Bab Nkob.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">On Two Wheels</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cycling around Marrakesh is physically easy, as the city is flat and open. The drawbacks are hectic roads, the \"shut-your-eyes-and-go\" approach to crossing streets, and constantly having to dodge pedestrians, donkey carts, and cars. But if you\'re feeling tough, a bike is perfect for a ride out to the Menara or Agdal gardens or north on the Casablanca road to the Palmery oasis circuit and back, 25 km (16 mi) in all. You can rent bikes opposite the Hotel Imperial Borj, in Hivernage; outside the Hotel Safir Siaha, on the Casablanca road; or inquire at your hotel\'s front desk.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">-James Knight &amp; Katrina Manson</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Marrakesh Three Ways</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>It\'s best to visit the north of the medina</b> in the morning, when you\'re likely to have plenty of energy for the rigors of the souk and the tanneries. Start by enjoying breakfast from a terrace café overlooking the <b>Djemâa el Fna</b> and watching the human bazaar on display. Then plunge into one of the roads running north into the <b>souk,</b> where you can window-shop on your way to the <b>Qoubba Almoravid,</b> the <b>Musée de Marrakesh,</b> and the <b>Ali ben Youssef Medersa.</b> You\'ll also pass some <b><i>fondouks,</i></b> medieval warehouses and inns that are still in use. From here you can continue on Rue Bab Debbagh toward the <b>tanneries.</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Take a tour of the southern medina,</b> home to many of Marrakesh\'s historic monuments, for something slightly gentler. Start with a walk around the <b>Koutoubia Mosque,</b> then head down to Bab Agnaou and the <b>Saadian Tombs.</b> Afterward, retrace your steps and turn right into the narrow walled street just before the Bab Agnaou. Walk almost to the end of the wall; then turn right again and continue on this street to Place des Ferblantiers. When you go through the Bab Berrima arch you\'ll be in a large, rectangular enclosure. Look for the entrance to <b>El Badi Palace</b> to pay a visit. Return through the arch and walk a few minutes northeast through the <b>Mellah</b> to <b>La Bahia Palace</b> and <b>Dar Si Saïd,</b> two derbs north on Riad Zitoun Jdid. From here it\'s a short walk north on Riad Zitoun Jdid to <b>Djemâa el Fna,</b> where you can stop for lunch.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Scenic spots on the city\'s perimeter</b> make for a lovely sunset jaunt, whether on foot or during a calèche ride. Relax in the <b>Menara Garden</b> or (on Friday and Sunday only) the <b>Agdal Garden,</b> via the <b>Méchouar</b>; or tour the <b>Ramparts</b> or, just outside town, the <b>Palmery.</b></div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Today it\'s a romantic set of sandstone ruins, policed by nesting storks. Sultan Ahmed el Mansour\'s lavish creation was ransacked by Moulay Ismail in the 17th century to help him complete his own palace at Meknes. But it\'s not hard to see why the palace, whose name translates as \"The Marvel,\" was once among the world\'s most impressive monuments. A huge swimming pool in the center (still there today) is flanked by four others, along with four sunken orange orchards. The main hall was named the Koubba el Khamsiniyya, referring to its 50 grand marble columns. Along the southern wall is a series of below-ground corridors and underground dungeons. It\'s a vast, calm, and mystical place. Also on display is a collection of goods from the Minbar (pulpit from which the Imam gives services) of the Koutoubia Mosque. Once a year, in May or June, the ruins come to life during the Moroccan folklore festival.

The delicate intricacy of the <i>gibs</i> (stucco plasterwork), carved cedar, and <i>zellij</i> (mosaic) on display in the central courtyard makes the building seem to loom taller than it really does. As many as 900 students from Muslim countries all over the world once studied here, and arranged around the courtyard are their former sleeping quarters—a network of tiny upper-level rooms that resemble monks\' cells. The building was erected in the 14th century by the Merenids in a somewhat different style than that of other medersas; later, in the 16th century, Sultan Abdullah el Ghallib rebuilt it almost completely, adding the Andalusian details. The large main courtyard, framed by two columned arcades, opens into a prayer hall elaborately decorated with rare palm motifs as well as the more customary Islamic calligraphy. The medersa also contains a small mosque. COST: 40 DH for medersa, 60 DH for combination ticket (bought at Musée de Marrakesh) also includes museum and Qoubba Almoravid.

The Melbourne International Arts Festival, the city\'s cultural highlight, runs for 17 days in October and includes diverse theater, dance, visual arts, opera, and music events.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Great Outdoors</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Melbourne is an excellent jumping-off point for outdoor adventures, including bushwalking, biking, surf-and-turf trips down the Great Ocean Road, boat cruises along the Yarra River, and forays to any of Victoria\'s outstanding national parks.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fabulous Markets</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Melbourne has nearly a dozen major markets selling an amazing array of fresh produce to eclectic fashion and unusual bric-a-brac. The huge Queen Victoria Market (The Vic) has more than 1,000 stalls and is a must.

The Parliament House tram stop gives access to the Princess Theatre, the grand Windsor Hotel, Parliament House, the Paris End of Collins Street, and St. Patrick\'s Cathedral. Get off at Flinders Street, take a peek in Young and Jackson\'s pub at the infamous <i>Chloe</i> painting, and then walk over the Princes Bridge. There you can stroll along the bank of the Yarra looking back at Federation Square and the city skyline, and then wander along Southbank while checking out the restaurants and shops at Southgate and the Crown Casino. A trip to the Melbourne Observation Deck will put the city into perspective and you can decide whether or not you want to head northeast to Fitzroy for a meander along groovy Brunswick Street, or north towards Carlton to immerse yourself in Little Italy.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You might squeeze in a bit more exploring on Day 1 with a stroll through Treasury Gardens and over to Fitzroy Gardens for a look at Captain Cook\'s Cottage, or see the sharks at the Melbourne Aquarium opposite Southbank. On your second day, stroll through the Royal Botanic Gardens and see the Shrine of Remembrance. Then take a tram on St. Kilda Road to the hip Acland Street area, in the suburb of St. Kilda, for dinner. On Day 3, take a tour of Chapel Street\'s shops, restaurants, and bars; it\'s Melbourne\'s hippest district.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 5 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Take in one or more sights outside the city. Head east to the Yarra Valley on an organized winery tour, or head to the Dandenong Ranges for a ride on the Puffing Billy steam railway from Belgrave through the fern gullies and forests of the Dandenong ranges. On the way back, stop at a teahouse in Belgrave or Olinda and browse the curio stores. Or, take an evening excursion to Phillip Island for the endearing sunset Penguin Parade. A trip to the Mornington Peninsula wineries and Arthurs Seat, just 90 minutes south of Melbourne, is another great day trip. There you can rest and recuperate with a soak in the Peninsula Hot Springs.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Both the river and the people who first appreciated it are celebrated in Memphis today. The Native American river culture that existed here from the 11th through the 15th centuries is documented in archaeological excavations, reconstructions, and exhibits at the Chucalissa Archaeological Museum. The river itself is celebrated with a museum dedicated to its history—part of Mud Island, a unique park occupying an island in the river.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The other significant influence on the city has been the music that has flowed through it. W. C. Handy moved from Alabama to Memphis in 1902-03, drawn by the long-thriving music scene, and it was here that he produced most of the blues songs that made him famous. The recent history of legendary Beale Street reflects that of all modern Memphis. Economic decline in the mid-20th century brought the city to its knees, and the unrest following the assassination in 1968 of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the Lorraine Motel, just south of Beale, dealt a near-fatal blow. Today, thanks to public improvements and an economy built around such distribution giants as Federal Express, Memphis has been brought back to life, and Beale Street has numerous clubs and restaurants, as it did in its heyday.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When you mention Memphis, one name springs to most minds: Elvis, the undisputed king of rock and roll. Although he was actually born across the state line in Tupelo, Mississippi, Elvis put Memphis on the map, recording his first hits here in what came to be known as Sun Studio. His legacy burns bright at Graceland, the estate where he lived, died, and rests in peace. Each year hundreds of thousands of fans make the pilgrimage to pay homage to the man and his music. Elvis International Tribute Week, held each August at Graceland, has grown to match the myth.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Good Tour of Downtown Memphis</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Old and new mingle as Memphis progresses with its riverfront development and urban renewal. Peabody Place, a collection of offices, shops, restaurants, and apartments, is a development in the area surrounding the Peabody Hotel at 2nd Street and Union Avenue. For travelers who want to tour the area without parking worries, the downtown trolley system runs a north-south route down Main Street, connecting major attractions. A new loop adjacent to Riverside Drive completes the 5-mi circle.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Tour</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pick up a map of the city at the <b>Tennessee Welcome Center</b> on Riverside Drive, where free parking is available. Take the Main Street trolley south to South Main Street to <b>Peabody Place</b> to visit the <b>Center for Southern Folklore,</b> where the region\'s colorful past is chronicled in poignant exhibits. Continue south on foot to Beale Street and sneak a peak at the stately <b>Orpheum Theatre</b>; walk east to <b>A. Schwab Dry Goods Store,</b> a most unusual emporium. A few blocks east on Beale is <b>Handy Park,</b> where the father of the blues is immortalized. You can learn all about him at the nearby <b>W. C. Handy Memphis Home and Museum.</b> Walk farther east on Beale to the <b>Hunt-Phelan Home</b> for a tour. Head for the south end of downtown (take the Main Street trolley five blocks) to tour the <b>National Civil Rights Museum,</b> on the site where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, or north to the <b>Memphis Music Hall of Fame Museum.</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Take the Main Street trolley north to Adams Avenue and walk west to the <b>Mud Island</b> Monorail to catch a ride over to the Mississippi River Park and Museum. When you come back, the <b>Pyramid</b> is several blocks away from Mud Island parking and can be visited by trolley. Afterwards, pick up your car and drive east on Adams, first to the <b>Fire Museum of Memphis,</b> then on to the Victorian Village Historic District for tours of the <b>Magevney, Mallory Neely,</b> and <b>Woodruff-Fontaine</b> houses. On the way out of downtown, stop at <b>Sun Studio</b> for a dose of Memphis music history.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Timing</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend the morning in the Beale Street Historic District—the Hunt-Phelan Tour alone will take an hour—and work in lunch while you\'re there. The rest of downtown Memphis will take more than a day to cover, so depending on your schedule, you may want to pick and choose. Most of these attractions are closed Monday; the National Civil Rights Museum is closed Tuesday.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sizzling, Smokin\' Tastes of Memphis</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To many folks, Memphis means barbecue, and in Memphis, barbecue means pork. It can be sandwiches of \"pulled\" pork loin drenched in sweet, tomato-based sauce and topped with coleslaw, or pork ribs coated in spices. (The latter are called \"dry ribs,\" not because the meat isn\'t succulent and juicy, but because they are sauceless.) Either way, the meat is slow-cooked over hardwood coals in a barrel cooker.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are dozens of barbecue restaurants in Memphis, peddling subtly different versions of the classic product. Corky\'s is the powerhouse. The line of people waiting for a table often extends out the door of the restaurant on Poplar Avenue in East Memphis. Corky\'s also has branches at Memphis International, in Nashville, in Tunica, Mississippi, and in New Orleans. Corky\'s and the Rendezvous, a downtown restaurant known for dry ribs, also operate thriving mail order businesses. They\'re happy to FedEx a slab of ribs to barbecue lovers anywhere in the country.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The serious connoisseur of barbecue will also want to seek out some of the smaller, family-run operations. The choices are many—in this city, you can find a good plate of barbecue almost anywhere, including one combination laundromat and barbecue shop. Some of the best spots are the Bar-B-Q Shop, the Cozy Corner, Gridley\'s, Interstate, Neeley\'s, and Payne\'s. Nearby Tipton County is known for a slightly more vinegary style of barbecue. Bozo\'s, in the minuscule town of Mason, is the most popular restaurant for this variation of the grilled meat theme.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Not surprisingly, this city of barbecue aficionados is the site of the World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest. Each May, more than 225 cooking teams compete for $40,000 in prizes—and the highly coveted \"World Champion\" title.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The best barbecue in Memphis, however, might very well be what\'s prepared in backyards and on front porches across the city. On holiday weekends in the summer, the whole town smells of barbecue smoke.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It is both the oldest (founded in 1325) and the highest (7,350 feet) metropolis on the North American continent. And with an estimated 22 million inhabitants it\'s the most populous city in the Western Hemisphere.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As the gargantuan pyramids of Teotihuacán attest, the area around Mexico City was occupied from early times by a great civilization, probably Nahuatl in origin. The founding farther south of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlán, did not occur until more than 600 years after Teotihuacán was abandoned, around AD 750. Between these periods, from 900 to 1200, the Toltec Empire controlled the valley of Mexico. As the story goes, the nomadic Aztecs were searching for a promised land in which to settle. Their prophecies announced that they would recognize the spot when they encountered an eagle perched on a prickly pear cactus and holding a snake in its beak. In 1325, the disputed date of Tenochtitlán\'s founding, they discovered this eagle in the valley of Mexico, the image of which is now emblazoned on the national flag. They settled on what was then an island in shallow Lake Texcoco and connected it to lakeshore satellite towns by a network of <i>calzadas</i> (canals and causeways, now freeways). Even then it was the largest city in the Western Hemisphere and, according to historians, one of the three largest cities on Earth. When he first laid eyes on Tenochtitlán in the early 16th century, Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés was dazzled by the glistening lacustrine metropolis, which reminded him of Venice.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A combination of factors made the Spanish conquest possible. Aztec emperor Moctezuma II believed the white, bearded Cortés on horseback to be the mighty plumed serpent-god Quetzalcóatl, who, according to prophecy, was supposed to arrive from the east in the year 1519 to rule the land. Thus, Moctezuma welcomed the foreigner with gifts of gold and palatial accommodations. In return, Cortés initiated a massacre. He was backed by a huge army of Indians from other settlements such as Cholula and Tlaxcala, who saw a chance to end their submission to the Aztec empire. With these forces, the European tactical advantages of horses, firearms, and, inadvertently, the introduction of smallpox and the common cold, Cortés succeeded in erasing Tenochtitlán only two centuries after it was founded.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cortés began building the capital of what he patriotically dubbed New Spain, the Spanish empire\'s colony that would spread north to cover what is now the southwestern United States, and south to Panama. <i>Mexico</i> comes from <i>Mexica</i> (pronounced meh-shee-ka), which was the Aztecs\' name for themselves. (Aztec is the Spaniards\' name for the Mexica.) At the site of Tenochtitlán\'s demolished ceremonial center—now the 10-acre Zócalo—Cortés started building a church (the precursor of the impressive Metropolitan Cathedral), mansions, and government buildings. He utilized the slave labor, and the artistry, of the vanquished native Mexicans. On top of the ruins of their city, and using rubble from it, they were forced to build what became the most European-style city in North America. But instead of having the random layout of contemporary medieval cities, it followed the grid pattern of the Aztecs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For much of the construction material the Spaniards quarried the local porous, volcanic, reddish stone called <i>tezontle.</i> The Spaniards also drained the lakes, preferring wheels and horses (which they introduced to Mexico) over canals and canoes for transport. The land-filled lake bed turned out to be a soggy support for the immense buildings that have been slowly sinking into it since they were built.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city flourished during the colonial period, filling what is now its historic center with architectural treasures. The Franciscans and Dominicans eagerly set about converting the Aztecs to Christianity, but some indigenous customs persisted. Street vending, for instance, is a city signature even today. It is said that the conquering soldiers looked out on them in 1520 and said they had never seen such a market, not even in Rome. In 1571 the Spaniards established the Inquisition in New Spain and burned heretics at its palace headquarters, now a museum in Plaza de Santo Domingo.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It took almost three centuries for Mexicans to rise up successfully against Spain. The historic downtown street 16 de Septiembre commemorates the \"declaration\" of Independence. On that date in 1810, Miguel Hidalgo, father of the Catholic Church—and of a couple of illegitimate daughters—rang a church bell and cried out his history-making <i>grito</i> (shout): \"Death to the <i>gachupines</i> [wealthy Spaniards living in Mexico]! Long live the Virgin of Guadalupe!\" Excommunicated and executed the following year, Hidalgo is one of many independence heroes who fostered a truly popular movement, culminating in Mexico\'s independence in 1821. The liberty bell that now hangs above the main entrance to the National Palace is rung on every eve of September 16 by the president of the republic, who then shouts a revised version of the patriot\'s cry: \"¡Viva México!\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Flying in or out of Mexico City you get an aerial view of the remaining part of Lake Texcoco on the eastern outskirts of the city. In daylight you\'ll notice the sprawling flatness of the 1,480-square-km (570-square-mi) Meseta de Anáhuac (Valley of Mexico), completely surrounded by mountains. On its southeastern side, two usually snowcapped volcanoes, Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl, are both well over 17,000 feet high. After a period of relative tranquillity, Popocatépetl, known as El Popo, awoke and began spewing smoke, ash, and some lava in the mid-1990s; it has remained intermittently active since then.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sadly, the single most widely known fact about Mexico City is that its air is polluted. There\'s no denying the smog and nightmarish traffic, but strict legislation in recent years has led to cleaner air and, especially after the summer rains, the city has some of the clearest, bluest skies anywhere.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If the city\'s notoriety for smog brings Los Angeles to mind, so might the fault line that runs through the valley. In 1985 a major earthquake—8.1 on the Richter scale—took a tragic toll. The government reported 10,000 deaths, but locally it\'s said to be closer to 50,000. The last traces of that quake\'s damage have disappeared with the major renovation project in the capital\'s historic center, an overhaul that includes the application of the latest earthquake-resistant technology.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Sun Stone</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Aztec calendar stone—the original <i>Piedra del Sol</i> (Stone of the Sun)—is in the anthropology museum\'s Room 7 (Sala Mexica). The 12-foot, 25-ton, intricately carved, basalt slab describing Aztec life is one of Mexico\'s most famous symbols. Nobel Prize-winning poet and essayist Octavio Paz immortalized the stone in his epic poem \"Piedra del Sol.\" The stone was carved in the late 1400s; it was discovered buried beneath the Zócalo in 1790. It was originally thought to be a calendar, and, for a brief time, a sacrificial altar. In the stone\'s center is the sun god Tonatiuh. The rest of the carvings explain the Aztecs\' idea of the cosmos: namely, that prior to their existence, the world had endured four periods (called suns) of creation and destruction. Four square panels surrounding the center image represent these four worlds and their destruction (by jaguars, wind, firestorms, and water, respectively). The ring around the panels is filled with symbols representing the 20 days of the Aztec month. Finally, two snakes form an outer ring and point to a date, 1011 AD—the date the fifth sun, or the Aztecs\' current world, was created. The Aztecs believed that this fifth sun was the final sun; they believed that one day they would witness a catastrophic end of the world.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The museum was established by Olmedo, his lifelong model, patron, and onetime mistress. The lavish display of nearly 140 pieces from his cubist, post-cubist, and mural periods hangs in a magnificent 17th-century hacienda with lovely gardens. Concerts and entertainment for children are held on weekends, while gaggles of geese and strutting peacocks add to the clamor. This is also the place to see the strange Mexican hairless dog: Ms. Olmedo shares Rivera\'s passion for these creatures and keeps a few as pets on the grounds. There is a lovely small café in a glassed-in gazebo. The museum is reachable by public transportation; at the Tasqueña metro station, catch the light-rail to La Noria (<i>not</i> Xochimilco). As you exit the light-rail station, cross the street via the stairway bridge. Walk half a block on 20 de Noviembre until you come to a traffic intersection.

The film traces the course of Mexican prehistory and the pre-Hispanic cultures of Mesoamerica. The 12 ground-floor rooms treat pre-Hispanic cultures by region, in the Sala Teotihuacána, Sala Tolteca, Sala Oaxaca (Zapotec and Mixtec peoples), and so on. Objects both precious and pedestrian, including statuary, jewelry, weapons, figurines, and pottery, evoke the intriguing, complex, and frequently bloodthirsty civilizations that peopled Mesoamerica for the 3,000 years preceding the Spanish invasion.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A copy of the Aztec ruler Moctezuma\'s feathered headdress (the original is now in Vienna); a stela from Tula, near Mexico City; massive Olmec heads from Veracruz; and vivid reproductions of Mayan murals in a reconstructed temple are other highlights. Be sure to see the magnificent reconstruction of the tomb of 8th-century Mayan ruler Pacal, which was discovered in the ruins of Palenque. The perfectly preserved skeletal remains lie in an immense stone chamber, and the stairwell walls leading to it are splendidly decorated with bas-relief scenes of the underworld. Pacal\'s jade death mask is on display nearby.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The nine rooms on the upper floor contain faithful ethnographic displays of current indigenous peoples, using maps, photographs, household objects, folk art, clothing, and religious articles.

But why here? What did this city do to deserve some of the world\'s most beautiful and stylish buildings?</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The story begins in the 1920s, when Miami Beach established itself as America\'s Winter Playground. Long before Las Vegas got the idea, Miami Beach sprouted hostelries resembling Venetian palaces, Spanish villages, and French châteaux. To complement the social activities of the hotels, the city provided gambling, prostitution, and bootleg whiskey. Miami became a haven for out-of-town high rollers.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the early 1930s, drawn south by the prospect of warm beaches and luxurious tropical surroundings, middle-class tourists fueled a second boom. More hotels had to be built, but it wouldn\'t do for Miami to open the same type of boring, staid hotels found across America. En masse, architects decided the motif of choice would be...Art Deco.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In truth, the design was art moderne. For purists, the term <i>moderne</i> was a bow to the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes held in Paris in 1925. Moderne offered a distinctive yet affordable design solution for the hotels, stores, clubs, and apartment buildings that would be built to accommodate the needs of a new breed of tourist.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">An antidote to the gloom of the Great Depression, this look was cheerful and tidy. Along South Beach, Miami received an architectural makeover. Elaborating on the styles introduced in Paris, architects borrowed elements of American industrial design. The features of trains, ocean liners, and automobiles were stripped down to their streamlined essentials, inspiring new looks for the Art Deco hotels.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With a steel-and-concrete box as a foundation, architects dipped into this grab bag of styles to accessorize their hotels. Pylons, spheres, cylinders, and cubes thrust from facades and roofs. \"Eyebrows,\" small ledges over windows, popped out to provide shade. Softening the boxy buildings\' edges, designers added curved corners and wraparound windows. Sunlight, an abundant commodity in Miami Beach, was brought indoors by glass-block construction. Landscapers learned to create an illusion of coolness by planting palms and laying terrazzo floors.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A uniform style soon marked Miami\'s new hotels. A vertical central element raced past the roofline and into the sky to create a sense of motion. To add to the illusion that these immobile buildings were rapidly speeding objects, colorful bands known as racing stripes were painted around the corners. In keeping with the beachside setting, designers adorned hotels with nautical elements. Portholes appeared in sets of three on facades or within buildings. Images of seaweed, starfish, and rolling ocean waves were plastered, painted, or etched on walls. Some of the buildings looked as if they were ready to go to sea.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Art-deco design translated the synchronized choreography of Busby Berkeley movie musicals into architecture. Ordinary travelers could now take a low-cost vacation in an oceanfront fantasy world of geometric shapes and amusing colors. All this was created not for millionaires but for regular folks, those who collected a weekly paycheck...who, for one brief, shining moment, could live a life of luxury.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">[bl]-Gary McKechnie</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Once comprising 180 acres, the grounds now occupy a 30-acre tract that includes a native hammock and more than 10 acres of formal gardens with fountains overlooking Biscayne Bay. The house, open to the public, contains 70 rooms, 34 of which are filled with paintings, sculpture, antique furniture, and other fine and decorative arts. The pieces date from the 15th through the 19th century and represent the Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, and Neoclassical movements. So unusual and impressive is Vizcaya that visitors have included many major heads of state. Guided tours are available.

It has boardwalks, 18 picnic shelters, and 2 cafés that serve light lunches. A stroll or ride along walking and bicycle paths provides wonderful views of Miami\'s dramatic skyline. From the southern end of the park you can see a handful of houses rising over the bay on wooden stilts, the remnants of Stiltsville, built in the 1940s and now dying a natural death. Bill Baggs has bicycle rentals, a playground, fishing piers, and guided tours of the <b>Cape Florida Lighthouse,</b> South Florida\'s oldest structure. The lighthouse was erected in 1845 to replace an earlier one destroyed in an 1836 Seminole attack, in which the keeper\'s helper was killed. Plantings around the lighthouse and keeper\'s cottage recall the island\'s past. The restored cottage and lighthouse offer free tours at 10 AM and 1 PM Thursday to Monday. Be there a half hour beforehand. www.floridastateparks.org/capeflorida. COST: $3 per single-occupant vehicle, $5 per vehicle with 2-8 people; $1 per person on bicycle, bus, motorcycle, or foot.

Sea grass-studded dunes, blue-green waters, and plenty of native plants and trees add to the tranquil setting. The 410-acre park has a restored lighthouse, 18 picnic shelters, and a casual seafood restaurant, which also serves beer and wine.

The beach is wide, white, and bathed by warm aquamarine waves. Separating the sand from the traffic of Ocean Drive is palm-fringed Lummus Park, with its volleyball nets and chickee huts (huts made of palmetto thatch over a cypress frame) for shade. The beach also plays host to some of the funkiest lifeguard stands you\'ll ever see, pop stars shooting music videos, and visitors from all over the world. The beach at 12th Street is popular with gays. Locals hang out on 3rd Street beach, where they watch fit Brazilians play foot volley, a variation of volleyball that uses everything but the hands! Because much of South Beach has an adult flavor—women are often casually topless—many families prefer Mid- and North Beach. Unless you\'re parking south of 3rd Street, metered spaces near the waterfront are rarely empty. Instead, opt for a public garage and walk; you\'ll have lots of fun people-watching, too. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The islands differ remarkably, and are all beautiful. It is possible to \"see\" any island in a day, for they are small and the \"must-see\" sights are few—Delos, Santorini\'s caldera, the Minoan site at Akrotiri, and Paros\'s Hundred Doors Church. So planning a trip depends on your sense of inclusiveness, your restlessness, your energy, <i>and</i> your ability to accommodate changing boat schedules.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In summer, when high-speed ferries and fast interisland boats run frequently, you can easily visit both Mykonos and Santorini in three days. On <b>Mykonos</b>-you can spend the first day and evening enjoying appealing Mykonos town, where a maze of beautiful streets are lined with shops, bars, restaurants, and discos; spend time on one of the splendid beaches; and, if you want to indulge in some hedonism, partake of the wild nightlife.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The next morning take the local boat to nearby <b>Delos</b>-for one of the great classical sites in the Aegean; you\'ll be back in time to board a fast boat to <b>Santorini</b> -. Once you\'ve settled in, have a sunset drink on a terrace overlooking the caldera, one of the world\'s great sights; you\'ll find many view-providing watering holes in Fira, the capital, or Ia, Greece\'s most-photographed village. The next day, visit the extensive prehistoric site at Akrotiri and the Museum of Prehistoric Thera; then have a swim one of the black-sand beaches at Kamari or Perissa.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Alternatively, say if off-season boat schedules make it too difficult to visit both Santorini and Mykonos in so short a time, after a day and a morning on Mkyonos and Delos go to nearby <b>Tinos.</b> Here, you can visit Greece\'s most popular pilgrimage site and also drive through beautiful villages, such as Kardiani.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 5 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Follow the three-day itinerary for <b>Mykonos</b>-(and <b>Delos</b> -) and <b>Santorini</b>-above, but between Mykonos and Santorini pull into <b>Naxos</b> -. Plan on arriving from Mykonos in the late afternoon or evening, and begin with a predinner stroll around Naxos town, visiting the Portara (an ancient landmark), the castle, and other sights in the old quarter. The next morning, visit the Archaeological Museum; then drive through the island\'s mountainous center for spectacular views. Along the way, visit such sights as the Panayia Drosiani, a church near Moni noted for 7th-century frescoes; the marble-paved village of Apeiranthos; and the Temple of Demeter. If you have time, stop for a swim at one of the beaches facing Paros, say Mikri Vigla; then board a fast boat for the sail down to Santorini, arriving in time to see the sun set over the caldera.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 8 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you want a good overview of the Cyclades, with time out for some hiking, visits to Byzantine churches, and relaxation, begin with a day and a night in elegant, nontouristy <b>Andros</b>, where you might want to settle into Andros town for the night or, if you want to be on the beach, Batsi. Spend the morning and early afternoon of the next day driving around the island to explore its small villages and lush mountainsides. The next stop is <b>Tinos,</b> for an overnight in Tinos town and, the next morning, a visit to Panayia Evangelistria (Church of the Annunciate Virgin), Greece\'s most popular pilgrimage site, and a few of the island\'s many beautiful villages, including Pirgos.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Then it\'s on to <b>Mykonos</b>-for two days and nights, with a visit to <b>Delos</b> -, some downtime on one of the island\'s splendid beaches, and visits to such sights as the Archaeological Museum and the Monastery of the Panayia Tourliani in Ano Mera. Continue south for an overnight on <b>Naxos</b> -, where you\'ll want to see Naxos town and to make at least a short drive into the mountainous center. Then head to <b>Paros,</b> where you should enjoy a meal in the little fishing harbor of Naousa and, on a morning drive around the island, visit the lovely mountain village of Lefkes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Finally, it\'s time to head to beautiful <b>Santorini</b>-for the final two days of the itinerary. Should you have time and energy, you may well decide to continue exploring the other Cycladic islands, especially Siphnos and Melos—all have their own beauties.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cubism, Cyclades Style </h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the real draws of the Cyclades is the sight of miragelike, white clusters of houses appearing alongside blue waters or tumbling down cliffs and hillsides. Ia and Fira, the two caldera-side towns on Santorini, are the best places to see this typical Cyclades style of architecture, where cubical, whitewashed houses are built one atop another.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mykonos town, a warren of square, white houses arrayed along mazelike streets to confound invaders, is another architectural delight. Distinctive architecture will catch your eye throughout these islands: the stone walls and fanciful dovecotes on Andros; the marble squares in the town of Pirgos, on Tinos; Venetian landmarks in Naxos town.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Traditional Festivals </h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">All over Greece, villages, towns, and cities have traditional celebrations that vary from joyous to deeply serious, and the Cyclades are no exception. These festivals commemorate significant religious and secular events in all kinds of ways—with special foods, dancing, music, and other activities. Whatever islands you\'re visiting, check out what\'s happening and participate if you can. It\'s a wonderful way to discover the unique spirit of a place and to see the locals. You may even be able to join in some of the dances.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ano Aprovato, a village south of Batsi on Andros, holds a <i>paneyiri</i> (festival) on August 15, for the Dormition of the Virgin Mary, with feasting and dancing along with the religious rites.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In Tinos town on Tinos, the healing icon from Panayia Evangelistria church is paraded with much pomp on Annunciation Day, March 25, and especially Dormition Day, August 15. As it is carried on poles over the heads of the faithful, cures are effected, and religious emotion runs high. On July 23, in honor of St. Pelagia, the icon is paraded from Kechrovouni Nunnery, and afterward the festivities continue long into the night, with music and fireworks.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\'re on Santorini on July 20, you can partake in the celebration of St. Elias\'s name-day, when a traditional pea-and-onion soup is served, followed by walnut and honey desserts and folk dancing.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Naxos has its share of festivals to discover and enjoy. Naxos town celebrates the Dionysia festival during the first week of August, with concerts, costumed folk dancers, and free food and wine in the square. During Carnival, preceding Lent,\"bell wearers\" take to the streets in Apeiranthos and Filoti, running from house to house making as much noise as possible with strings of bells tied around their waists. They\'re a disconcerting sight in their hooded cloaks, as they escort a man dressed as a woman from house to house to collect eggs. In Apeiranthos, villagers square off in rhyming-verse contests: on the last Sunday of Lent, the <i>paliomaskari,</i> their faces blackened, challenge each other in improvising <i>kotsakia</i> (satirical couplets). At the May Day Festival in Koronos, wildflower garlands are made, and there\'s lively dancing. On July 14, Ayios Nikodemos Day is celebrated in Chora with a procession of the patron saint\'s icon through town, but the Dormition of the Virgin on August 15 is, after Easter and Christmas, the festival most widely celebrated, especially in Sangri, Filoti (where festivities take place on August 4), and Apeiranthos.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On Paros each year on August 23, Naousa celebrates the heroic naval battle against the Turks, with children dressed in native costume, great feasts, and traditional dancing. The day ends with 100 boats illuminated by torches converging on the harbor.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The church\'s <b>marble courtyards</b> (note the green-veined Tiniot stone) are paved with pebble mosaics and surrounded by offices, chapels, a health station, and <b>seven museums.</b> Inside the <b>upper three-aisle church</b> dozens of beeswax candles and precious votives—don\'t miss the golden orange tree near the door donated by a blind man who was granted sight—dazzle the eye. You must often wait in line to see the little icon, which is encrusted with jewels, donated as thanks for cures. To beseech the icon\'s aid, a sick person sends a young female relative or a mother brings her sick infant. As the pilgrim descends from the boat, she falls to her knees, with traffic indifferently whizzing about her, and crawls painfully up the faded red padded lane on the main street—1 km (½ mi)—to the church. In the church\'s courtyards, she and her family camp for several days, praying to the magical icon for a cure, which sometimes comes. This procedure is very similar to the ancient one observed in Tinos\'s temple of Poseidon. The <b>lower church,</b> called the Evresis, celebrates the finding of the icon; in one room a baptismal font is filled with silver and gold votives. The chapel to the left commemorates the torpedoing by the Italians, on Dormition Day, 1940, of the Greek ship <i>Helle</i>; in the early stages of the war, the roused Greeks amazingly overpowered the Italians. COST: Free. OPEN: Daily 8:30-3. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Panayia Ekatontapyliani</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The splendid square above the port, to the northwest, was built to celebrate the church\'s 1,700th anniversary. From there you will see a white gate, the front of the former monastic quarters that surround the magnificent Panayia Ekatontapyliani (Hundred Doors Church), the earliest remaining Byzantine church in Greece. According to legend, 99 doors have been found in the church and the 100th will be discovered only after Constantinople is Greek again. Inside, the subdued light mixes with the dun, reddish, and green tufa (porous volcanic rock). The columns are classical and their capitals Byzantine. At the corners of the dome are two fading Byzantine frescoes depicting six-winged seraphim. The 6th-century iconostasis (with ornate later additions) is divided into five frames by marble columns. One panel contains the 14th-century icon of the Virgin, with a silver covering from 1777. The Virgin is carried in procession on the church\'s crowded feast day, August 15, the Dormition. The adjacent <b>Baptistery,</b> nearly unique in Greece, also built from the 4th to the 6th century, has a marble font and bits of mosaic floor.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 326, St. Helen—the mother of Emperor Constantine the Great—took a ship for the Holy Land to find the True Cross. Stopping on Paros, she had a vision of success and vowed to build a church there. She founded it but died before it was built. Her son built the church in 328 as a wooden-roof basilica. Two centuries later Justinian the Great, who ruled the Byzantine Empire in 527-65, had it splendidly rebuilt with a dome. He appointed Isidorus, one of the two architects of Constantinople\'s famed Ayia Sophia, to design it; Isidorus decided to send an apprentice, Ignatius, to Paros. Folk legends say that, upon its completion, Isidorus arrived in Paros for an inspection and discovered the dome to be so magnificent that, consumed by jealousy, he pushed the young apprentice off the roof. Ignatius grasped his master\'s foot as he fell, and the two tumbled to their death together. Two folk sculptures near the toilets at the sanctuary\'s baroque left portal portray them as two fat men, one pulling his beard with remorse and the other holding his cracked head. The church <b>museum,</b> at right, contains post-Byzantine icons.

We\'re talking about that thick and creamy, ice-cream-like dessert that contains egg yolks—not those wiggly, pudding-like dishes. Despite the fact that steamy hot days are in the minority in this Midwestern state, a substantial number of great frozen-custard stands can be found, especially in Milwaukee. The stands range from little mom-and-pops to large local chains with thriving businesses. Frozen custard is such a popular treat that most stands have billboards denoting the flavor of the day, lists of the flavors to come, and flavor-of-the-day hot lines. In general, the warmer the day, the longer the line is likely to be at a custard stand in Wisconsin; after just one taste, however, you\'ll agree it\'s worth the wait.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Breweries & Brewpubs</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Say Milwaukee, and most people think \"beer.\" Beer built the city, starting with the founding of Miller Brewing Company in 1855. Brewery barons built the mansions and vintage downtown buildings that frame the city\'s atmosphere. So it\'s fitting that microbreweries are leading the revival of Milwaukee\'s downtown. After many of the city\'s most famous beer labels—Schlitz, Pabst, and Blatz, to name a few—shut down their Milwaukee breweries, a bit of a beer void opened up.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1985, a west-coast transplant opened Sprecher Brewing Co., the city\'s first microbrewery. With Sprecher going strong as a regional brand, the door was opened for a late-20th-century beer blast. Milwaukee pubs proudly serve up lagers, stouts, and other specialty beers made locally by <b>Lakefront Brewery</b> (www.lakefrontbrewery.com), <b>Leinenkeugel\'s</b> (www.leinies.com), and <b>Sprecher</b> (www.sprecherbrewery.com).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Brewpubs are also now well established in downtown Milwaukee. Among the most popular with local beer aficionados: <b>Water St. Brewery</b> (202 N. Water St., www.waterstreetbrewery.com), <b>Rock Bottom Brewery</b> (740 N. Plankinton Ave., www.rockbottom.com), <b>Milwaukee Ale House</b> (233 N. Water St., www.ale-house.com), and <b>Stout Bros. Public Ale House</b> (777 N. Water St., www.stoutbros.com).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The beer gardens of Summerfest are a terrific place to sample these and other local brews.

The museum\'s lower-level café is a glass-walled promontory that faces the lake. Here, you can order light lunch or take a mid-afternoon coffee and dessert break.

Old-fashioned street lamps illuminate the area, and a small park and a pedestrian mall along Broadway Street strike a verdant note.

The beauty of the exhibits here is that they are all designed to give a sense of what it\'s like to be in the water with the animals—sardines swim around your head in a circular tank, and jellyfish drift in and out of view in dramatically lighted spaces that suggest the ocean depths. A petting pool gives you a hands-on experience with bat rays, and the million-gallon Outer Bay tank shows the vast variety of creatures (from sharks to placid-looking turtles) that live in the eastern Pacific. A Splash Zone with 45 interactive bilingual exhibits opened in 2008: here, kids (and kids-at-heart) can commune with sea dragons, potbellied seahorses, and other fascinating creatures. The only drawback to the experience is that it must be shared with the throngs of people that crowd the place daily; most think it\'s worth it. To avoid the crowds, arrive as soon as the aquarium opens or visit in mid-afternoon, after the field trip groups depart and youngsters head home for their naps. www.montereybayaquarium.org.

It will replace the present crowded and, quite fankly, dreary facility, A taxi to downtown costs about 550 pesos; plan on 620 pesos to reach the Ciudad Vieja.

The trip takes less than three hours to Montevideo and less than four hours to Colonia. A round-trip ticket between Buenos Aires and Montevideo costs about 3,000 pesos. A package that includes a round-trip ticket between Buenos Aires and Colonia and a shuttle bus to or from Montevideo costs about 2,000 pesos.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">By Bus</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Montevideo\'s public buses are a great alternative to taxis, which can be difficult to find during peak hours. Buses crisscross the entire city 24 hours a day. You don\'t need exact change, and the price for any trip within Montevideo is only 13 pesos.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Colonia is serviced by several regional bus lines, including Cot and TURIL. The three-hour ride costs less than 400 pesos.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">By Car</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Because La Rambla, Montevideo\'s riverside thoroughfare, extends for dozens of miles, driving is a good way to see the city. Roads are well maintained and drivers obey the traffic laws—a rarity in South America. It\'s easy to rent a car, both downtown and at the airport. In Montevideo you can rent from several major international companies, including Avis, Budget, and Dollar, and from smaller companies such as Inter Car and Multicar.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">By Taxi</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">All cabs have meters that count <i>fichas,</i> or pulses, each 1/10 km (1/20 mi). When you arrive at your destination, the driver will take out an official chart that calculates the fare from the number of pulses elapsed. You can hail taxis on the street with ease, or call one to pick you up at your hotel. A ride to the airport from the Old City costs about 500 pesos.</div><h4 class=\"WorldGuide\">What\'s In a Name?</h4><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Stories abound about the origin of Montevideo\'s unusual name. The generally accepted account holds that Magellan, traveling along the coast from Brazil in 1520, counted off six hills from the Brazilian border and thus named the city Monte (mountain) vi (roman numeral six) de (from) eo (<i>este a oeste,</i> or east to west).</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The filles du roy were young women without family or money but plenty of spunk who volunteered to cross the Atlantic on leaky wooden boats to become the wives and mothers of New France. At the Maison, they learned from St. Marguerite Bourgeoys and her religious order how to cook and clean, how to pray and read, and how to survive the rigors of colonial life. It can\'t have been easy—long hours, hard little beds, and cold stone walls—but it had its rewards and the prize at the end was a respectable, settled life. St. Marguerite also had some state-of-the-art domestic equipment—the latest in looms and butter churns, labor-saving spit turners for roasting meat, and an ingenious granite sink with a drainage system that piped water straight out to the garden. This little island of New France is well off the beaten path, deep in the working-class Pointe St-Charles neighborhood.

It\'s dark down there, and just a little creepy thanks to the 350-year-old tombstones teetering in the gloom, but it\'s worth the trip. This is a serious archaeological dig that takes you to the very foundations of the city. You begin on the banks of the long-vanished Rivière St-Pierre, where the first settlers built their homes and traded with the Native American inhabitants. From there you climb up toward the present, past the stone foundations of an 18th-century tavern and a 19th-century insurance building. Along the way, filmed figures representing past inhabitants appear on ghostly screens to chat to you about their lives and times. A more lighthearted exhibit explores life and love in multicultural Montréal. For a spectacular view of the Vieux-Port, the river, and the islands, ride the elevator to the top of the tower, or stop for lunch in the museum\'s glass-fronted café.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In summer there are re-creations of period fairs and festivals on the grounds near the museum. www.pacmuseum.qc.ca.

If landscapes are your thing, the collected works of Québec artist Marc-Aurèle Fortin were acquired by the museum in 2007. The museum\'s permanent collection includes everyone from Rembrandt to Renoir, and not surprisingly, one of the best assemblies of Canadian art anywhere, with works by such luminaries as Paul Kane, the Group of Seven, and Paul-Émile Borduas.You can trace the country\'s history from New France to New Age through the museum\'s decorative art, painting, and sculpture. But it\'s not all serious: in 2001 the museum absorbed the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, so you can also take a look at some fanciful bentwood furniture designed by Frank Gehry, a marvelous collection of 18th-century English porcelain, and 3,000—count \'em—Japanese snuffboxes collected by, of all people, Georges Clémenceau, France\'s prime minister during World War I. All this is housed in two buildings linked by an underground tunnel—the older, neoclassical <b>Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion,</b> on the north side of rue Sherbrooke, and the glittering, glass-fronted <b>Jean-Noël-Desmarais Pavilion,</b> across the street. In 2006 the museum also took over the nearby Erskine and American United Church, a monument to the days when Anglo-Scottish Protestants ruled the heights of the Square Mile. The church has 24 stained-glass windows by Louis Comfort Tiffany, the largest such collection outside the United States, but alas, they will be off limits until the museum completes a major 10-year rebuilding program. The museum also has a gift shop, a bookstore, a restaurant, a cafeteria, and a gallery where you can buy or even rent paintings by local artists. www.mmfa.qc.ca.

The park includes a major amusement park, acres of flower gardens, a beach with filtered water, and the Casino de Montréal. There\'s history, too, at the Old Fort, where soldiers in colonial uniforms display the military methods used in ancient wars.

Everything about the place, which opened in 1829, seems designed to make you gasp—from the 228-foot twin towers out front to the tens of thousands of 24-karat gold stars that stud the soaring blue ceiling. Nothing in a city renowned for churches matches Notre-Dame for sheer grandeur—or noisemaking capacity: its 12-ton bass bell is the largest in North America and its 7,000-pipe Casavant organ can make the walls tremble. The pulpit is a work of art in itself, with an intricately curving staircase and fierce figures of Ezekiel and Jeremiah crouching at its base. The whole place is so overwhelming it\'s easy to miss such lesser features as the stained-glass windows from Limoges and the side altars dedicated to St. Marguerite d\'Youville, Canada\'s first native-born saint; St. Marguerite Bourgeoys, Canada\'s first schoolteacher; and a group of Sulpician priests martyred in Paris during the French Revolution. For a peek at the magnificent baptistery, decorated with frescoes by Ozias Leduc, you\'ll have to tiptoe through the glassed-off prayer room in the northwest corner of the church. Every year dozens of brides march up the aisle of <b>Chapelle Notre-Dame-du-Sacré-Coeur</b> (Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Chapel), behind the main altar, to exchange vows with their grooms before a huge modern bronze sculpture that you either love or hate.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the evening, the nave of the main church is darkened for \"La Lumière Fut\" (\"There Was Light\"), a light-and-sound show that depicts the history of Montréal and showcases the church\'s extraordinary art.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Notre-Dame is an active house of worship, so dress accordingly (i.e., no shorts or bare midriffs). The main church is closed to tours on Sunday during the 9:30 AM, 11 AM, and 5 PM masses. The chapel can\'t be viewed weekdays during the 12:15 PM and 5 PM masses, and is often closed Saturday for weddings.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The stone residence on the west side of the basilica is the <b>Vieux</b><b>Séminaire</b> (Old Seminary), Montréal\'s oldest building. It was built in 1685 as a headquarters for the Sulpician priests who owned the island of Montréal until 1854. It\'s still a residence for the Sulpicians who administer the basilica.

The first line opened in 1935 and the earliest stations—in the city center and along the ring line—were built as public palaces. Many of the millions of commuters using the system each day bustle past chandeliers, sculptures, stained-glass windows, beautiful mosaics, and pink, white, and black marble. With its rich collection of decorative materials, the metro has often been called a museum; it\'s even been said that no geological museum in the world has such a peculiar stone library.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Mayakovskaya station,</b> opened in 1938, may well be the jewel in the crown of the Moscow metro. The vaulted ceiling of the grand central hall has 33 mosaic panels, based on the theme \"One Day of Soviet Skies,\" by Russian artist Alexander Deineka. <b>Novoslobodskaya,</b> opened in 1952, sparkles, thanks to its light-backed stained glass. With their Soviet-inspired designs, several other stations—such as <b>Ploshchad Revolutsii,</b> with its bronze figures from the socialist world order (farmers, soliders, and such)—are tourist attractions in their own right.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the past, Moscow\'s metro architects won international architecture awards for their designs. Designs of new stations, however, have departed somewhat from these grand old stations; they lack brass sculptures and intricate stained glass, for example. But with indirect lighting, exquisite marble, and an open, airy feeling, these new stations reflect modern life in a way that the monumental Soviet displays of past glories do not. Moscow\'s metro is in the top three most heavily used metro system in the world.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It was originally founded in 1806 as the Imperial Court Museum, which was created out of three royal treasuries: the Court Treasury, where the regalia of the tsars and ambassadorial gifts were kept; the Stable Treasury, which contained the royal harnesses and carriages used by the tsars during state ceremonies; and the Armory, a collection of arms, armor, and other valuable objects gathered from the country\'s chief armories and storehouses. The Imperial Court Museum was moved to the present building in 1851. It was further enhanced and expanded after the Bolshevik Revolution with valuables confiscated and nationalized from wealthy noble families as well as from the Patriarchal Sacristy of the Moscow Kremlin. The roughly 4,000 artifacts here date from the 12th century to 1917, and include a rare collection of 17th-century silver. The museum tour (at this writing you could only visit the museum by taking one of these tours) begins on the second floor. Halls (<i>zal</i>) VI-IX are on the first floor, Halls I-V on the second.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Hall I</b> displays the works of goldsmiths and silversmiths of the 12th through 19th centuries, and <b>Hall II</b> contains a collection of 18th- to 20th-century jewelry. One of the most astounding exhibits is the collection of Fabergé eggs on display in Hall II (Case 23). Among them is a silver egg whose surface is engraved with a map of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The \"surprise\" inside the egg, which is also on display, was a golden clockwork model of a train with a platinum engine, windows of crystal, and a headlight made of a tiny ruby. Feeling overwhelmed by everything to see at the Armory Palace? If nothing else, be sure to see the Fabergé eggs. If the weather is too good to spend all day indoors, check out the splendor of the Cathedral Square and come back to see the Armory another day.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Hall III</b> contains Asian and Western European arms and armor, including heavy Western European suits of armor from the 15th to 17th centuries; pistols; and firearms.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Hall IV</b> showcases a large collection of Russian arms and armor from the 12th to early 17th centuries, with a striking display of helmets. The earliest helmet here dates from the 13th century. Here, too, is the helmet of Prince Ivan, the son of Ivan the Terrible. The prince was killed by his father at the age of 28, an accidental victim of the tsar\'s unpredictable rage. The tragic event has been memorialized in a famous painting by Ilya Repin now in the Tretyakov Gallery, showing the frightened tsar holding his mortally wounded son.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Hall V</b> is filled with foreign gold and silver objects, mostly ambassadorial presents to the tsars. Among the displays is the \"Olympic Service\" of china presented to Alexander I by Napoléon after the signing of the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Hall VI</b> holds vestments of silk, velvet, and brocade, embroidered with gold and encrusted with jewels and pearls.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Hall VII</b> contains regalia and the imperial thrones. The oldest throne, veneered with carved ivory, belonged to Ivan the Terrible. The throne of the first years of Peter the Great\'s reign, when he shared power with his older brother Ivan, has two seats in front and one hidden in the back. The boys\' older sister, Sophia (1657-1704), who ruled as regent from 1682 to 1689, sat in the back, prompting the young rulers to give the right answers to the queries of ambassadors and others. Among the crowns, the oldest is the sable-trimmed Cap of Monomakh, which dates to the 13th century. Also on display in this section are several coronation dresses, including the one Catherine the Great wore in 1762.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Hall VIII</b> contains dress harnesses of the 16th through 18th centuries.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Hall IX</b> has a marvelous collection of court carriages.

Its main building is closed for a renovation and is expected to reopen partly in 2008 with complete renovation finished in 2010. You can still see performances at the Novaya Tsena (New Stage) to the left of it. The building itself is remarkable: its monumental colonnade is topped by a statue of bronze horses pulling the chariot of Apollo, patron of music. Its crimson-and-gold interior is similarly grand. All of this splendor is matched by the quality of the resident opera and ballet troupes—two of the most famous performing-arts companies in the world. If you want to have the pleasure of seeing a performance at the Bolshoi, be sure to book one of its 2,155 seats as far as possible in advance on their Web site, because performances can sell out quickly. An interesting footnote in the theater\'s and the Soviet Union\'s history: Lenin made his last public speech here, in 1922. Also to the left of the Bolshoi is the <b>RAMT</b> (Russian Academic Youth Theater), which puts on performances with a talented group of young actors. This is where you\'ll find the Bolshoi\'s main ticket office. The plaza, with fountains and fine wooden benches, is a nice spot for a relaxing look at the theater. www.bolshoi.ru. Metro:Teatralnaya. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Donskoy Monastery</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The 16th-century Donskoy Monastery, situated in a secluded, wooded area in the southwest section of Moscow, is a fascinating memorial to Russian architecture and art. From 1934 to 1992, a branch of the Shchusev Architecture Museum, keeping architectural details of churches, monasteries, and public buildings destroyed under the Soviets, was located—more or less secretly—inside its walls. Today the monastery is once again functioning as a religious institution. But the bits and pieces of demolished churches and monuments remain, forming a graveyard of destroyed architecture from Russia\'s past.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The monastery grounds are surrounded by a high defensive wall with 12 towers, the last of the defense fortifications to be built around Moscow. The monastery was built on the site where, in 1591, the Russian army stood waiting for an impending attack from Tatar troops grouped on the opposite side of the river. According to legend, the Russians awoke one morning to find the Tatars gone. Their sudden retreat was considered a miracle, and Boris Godunov ordered a monastery built to commemorate the miraculous victory. Of course, it didn\'t happen quite like that, but historians confirm that the Tatars did retreat after only minor skirmishes, which is difficult to explain. Never again would they come so close to Moscow. The victory was attributed to the icon of the Virgin of the Don that Prince Dimitry Donskoy had supposedly carried previously, during his campaign in 1380 (in which the Russians won their first decisive victory against the Tatars). The monastery was named in honor of the wonder-working icon.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When you enter the grounds through the western gates, an icon of the Virgin of the Don looks down on you from above the entrance to the imposing <b>New Cathedral.</b> The brick cathedral was built in the late 17th century by Peter the Great\'s half-sister, the regent Sophia. It has been under restoration for decades; services are held in the gallery surrounding the church, where the architectural exhibits were once housed. The smaller <b>Old Cathedral</b> stands to the right of the New Cathedral. The attractive red church with white trim was built between 1591 and 1593, during the reign of Boris Godunov. It\'s open for services.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the most fascinating sections of the monastery is its graveyard, with many fine examples of memorial art. After the plague swept through Moscow in 1771, Catherine the Great forbade any more burials in the city center. The Donskoy Monastery, at that time on the city\'s outskirts, became a fashionable burial place for the well-to-do. The small <b>Church of the Archangel</b> built against the fortification wall on the far right was the private chapel and crypt of the prominent Golitsyn family (original owners of the Arkhangelskoye estate). Many leading intellectuals, politicians, and aristocrats were buried here in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. COST: Free. OPEN: Daily 7:20-6. Metro:Shabolovskaya. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">New Maiden\'s Convent</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Enclosed by a crenellated wall with 12 colorful battle towers, the convent comprises several groups of buildings. Tsar Vasily III (1479-1533) founded the convent in 1524 on the road to Smolensk and Lithuania—a strategic way to commemorate Moscow\'s capture of Smolensk from Lithuania. Due to the tsar\'s initiative, it enjoyed an elevated position among the many monasteries and convents of Moscow and became a convent primarily for ladies of noble birth. Little remains of the original structure. The convent suffered severely during the Time of Troubles (approximately 1598-1613), concluding when the first Romanov was elected to the throne. Its current appearance dates largely from the 17th century, when the convent was significantly rebuilt and enhanced.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Among the first of the famous women to take the veil here was Irina, wife of the feebleminded Tsar Fyodor and the sister of Boris Godunov, in the 16th century. Opera fans may be familiar with the story of Boris Godunov, the subject of a well-known work by Mussorgsky. Godunov was a powerful nobleman who exerted much influence over the tsar. When Fyodor died, Godunov was the logical successor to the throne, but rather than proclaim himself tsar, he followed his sister to Novodevichy. Biding his time, Godunov waited until the clergy and townspeople begged him to become tsar. His election took place at the convent, inside the Cathedral of Smolensk. But his rule was ill-fated, touching off the Time of Troubles.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the next century, Novodevichy became the residence of yet another royal: Sophia, the half-sister of Peter the Great, who ruled as his regent from 1682 through 1689, while he was still a boy. She did not wish to give up her position when the time came for Peter\'s rule and was deposed by him. He then kept her prisoner inside Novodevichy. Even that was not enough to restrain the ambitious sister, and from her cell at the convent she organized a revolt of the <i>streltsy</i> (Russian militia). The revolt was summarily put down, and to punish Sophia, Peter had the bodies of the dead streltsy hung up along the walls of the convent and outside Sophia\'s window. Despite his greatness, Peter had a weakness for the grotesque, especially when it came to punishing his enemies. He left the decaying bodies hanging for more than a year. Yet another of the convent\'s later \"inmates\" was Yevdokiya Lopukhina, Peter\'s first wife. Peter considered her a pest and rid himself of her by sending her to a convent in faraway Suzdal. She outlived him, though, and eventually returned to Moscow. She spent her final years at Novodevichy, where she is buried.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You enter the convent through the arched passageway topped by the <b>Preobrazhensky Tserkov</b> (Gate Church of the Transfiguration), widely considered one of the best examples of Moscow baroque. To your left as you enter is the ticket booth, where tickets are sold to the various exhibits housed in the convent. Exhibits include rare and ancient Russian paintings, both ecclesiastical and secular; woodwork and ceramics; and fabrics and embroidery. There\'s also a large collection of illuminated and illustrated books, decorated with gold, silver, and jewels. The building to your right is the Lophukin House, where Yevdokiya lived from 1727 to 1731. Sophia\'s prison, now a guardhouse, is to your far right, in a corner of the northern wall.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The predominant structure inside the convent is the huge five-dome <b>Sobor Smolenskoy Bogomateri</b> (Cathedral of the Virgin of Smolensk), dedicated in 1525 and built by Alexei Fryazin. It was closely modeled after the Kremlin\'s Assumption Cathedral. Inside, there\'s a spectacular iconostasis with 84 wooden columns and icons dating from the 16th and 17th centuries. Simon Ushakov, a leader in 17th-century icon art, was among the outstanding Moscow artists who participated in the creation of the icons. Also here are the tombs of Sophia and Yevdokiya. Yet another historic tale connected to the convent tells how the cathedral was slated for destruction during the War of 1812. Napoléon had ordered the cathedral dynamited, but a brave nun managed to extinguish the fuse just in time, and the cathedral was spared.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the right of the cathedral is the <b>Uspensky Tserkov</b> (Church of the Assumption) and <b>Refectory,</b> originally built in 1687 and then rebuilt after a fire in 1796. It was here that the blue-blooded nuns took their meals.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If a convent can have a symbol other than an icon, then Novodevichy\'s would be the ornate belfry towering above its eastern wall. It rises 236 feet and consists of six ornately decorated tiers. The structure is topped by a gilded dome that can be seen from miles away. COST: 150R.

Spanning the 11th through the 20th centuries, the works include sacred icons, stunning portrait and landscape art, the famous Russian Realists\' paintings that culminated in the Wanderers\' Group, and the splendid creations of Russian Symbolism, impressionism, and art nouveau.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Tretyakov was officially opened in 1892 as a public state museum, but its origins predate that time by more than 35 years. In the mid-1800s, a successful young Moscow industrialist, Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov, was determined to amass a collection of national art that would be worthy of a museum of fine arts for the entire country. In pursuit of this high-minded goal, he began to purchase paintings, drawings, and sculpture, adjudged both on high artistic merit and on their place within the various important canons of their time. For the most part undeterred by critics\' disapproval and arbiters of popular taste, he became one of the—if not <i>the</i>—era\'s most valued patrons of the arts, with honor and gratitude conferred upon him still to this day.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Up until six years before his death, Tretyakov maintained his enormous collection as a private one, but allowed virtually unlimited free access to the public. In 1892 he donated his collection to the Moscow city government, along with a small inheritance of other fine works collected by his brother Sergei. The holdings have been continually increased by subsequent state acquisitions, including the nationalization of privately owned pieces after the Communist revolution.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are no English-language translations on the plaques here, but you can rent an audio guide or buy an English-language guidebook.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It may be the rich collection of works completed after 1850, however, that pleases museumgoers the most, for it comprises a selection of pieces from each of the Russian masters, sometimes of their best works. Hanging in the gallery are paintings by Nikolai Ge (<i>Peter the Great Interrogating the Tsarevich Alexei</i>), Vasily Perov (<i>Portrait of Fyodor Dostoyevsky</i>), Vasily Polenov (<i>Grandmother\'s Garden</i>), Viktor Vasnetsov (<i>After Prince Igor\'s Battle with the Polovtsy</i>), and many others. Several canvases of the beloved Ivan Shishkin, with their depictions of Russian fields and forests—including <i>Morning in the Pine Forest,</i> of three bear cubs cavorting—fill one room. There are also several paintings by the equally popular Ilya Repin, whose most famous painting, <i>The Volga Boatmen,</i> also bedecks the walls. Later works, from the end of the 19th century, include an entire room devoted to the Symbolist Mikhail Vrubel (<i>The Princess Bride, Demon Seated</i>); Nestorov\'s glowing <i>Vision of the Youth Bartholomew,</i> the boy who would become St. Sergius, founder of the monastery at Sergeyev-Posad; and the magical pieces by Valentin Serov (<i>Girl with Peaches, Girl in Sunlight</i>). You\'ll also see turn-of-the-20th-century paintings by Nikolai Konstantinovich Roerikh (1874-1947), whose New York City home is a museum.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The first floor houses the icon collection. Among the many delights here are icons painted in the late 14th and early 15th centuries by the master Andrei Rublyov, including his celebrated <i>Holy Trinity.</i> Also on display are icons of his disciples, Daniel Chorny among them, as well as some of the earliest icons to reach ancient Kievan Rus\', such as the 12th-century <i>Virgin of Vladimir,</i> brought from Byzantium.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The second floor holds 18th-, 19th-, and 20th-century paintings and sculpture and is where indefatigable Russian art lovers satisfy their aesthetic longings. A series of halls of 18th-century portraits, including particularly fine works by Dmitry Levitsky, acts as a time machine into the country\'s noble past. Other rooms are filled with works of the 19th century, embodying the burgeoning movements of romanticism and naturalism in such gems of landscape painting as Silvester Shchedrin\'s <i>Aqueduct at Tivoli</i> and Mikhail Lebedev\'s <i>Path in Albano</i> and <i>In the Park.</i> Other favorite pieces to look for are Karl Bryullov\'s <i>The Last Day of Pompeii,</i> Alexander Ivanov\'s <i>Appearance of Christ to the People,</i> and Orest Kiprensky\'s well-known <i>Portrait of the Poet Alexander Pushkin.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When you leave the gallery, pause a moment to look back on the fanciful art nouveau building itself, which is quite compelling. Tretyakov\'s original home, where the first collection was kept, still forms a part of the gallery. As the demands of a growing collection required additional space, the house was continually enlarged, until finally an entire annex was built to function as the gallery. In 1900, when there was no longer a family living in the house, the artist Viktor Vasnetsov undertook to create the wonderful facade the gallery now carries, and more space was later added. Keep in mind that the ticket office closes at 6:30 PM. www.tretyakov.ru. COST: 250R. OPEN: Tues.-Sun. 10-7:30.

It was commissioned by Ivan the Terrible to celebrate his conquest of the Tatar city of Kazan on October 1, 1552, the day of the feast of the Intercession. The central chapel, which rises 107 feet, is surrounded by eight towerlike chapels linked by an elevated gallery. Each chapel is topped by an onion dome carved with its own distinct pattern and dedicated to a saint on whose day the Russian army won battles against the Tatars. The cathedral was built between 1555 and 1560 on the site of the earlier Trinity Church, where the Holy Fool Vasily (Basil) had been buried in 1552. Basil was an adversary of the tsar, publicly reprimanding Ivan the Terrible for his cruel and bloodthirsty ways. He was protected, however, from the tsar by his status as a Holy Fool, for he was considered by the Church to be an emissary of God. Ironically, Ivan the Terrible\'s greatest creation has come to be known by the name of his greatest adversary. In 1558 an additional chapel was built in the northeast corner over Basil\'s remains, and from that time on the cathedral has been called St. Basil\'s.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Very little is known about the architect who built the cathedral. It may have been the work of two men—Barma and Postnik—but now it seems more likely that there was just one architect, Postnik Yakovlyev, who went by the nickname Barma. Legend has it that upon completion of the cathedral, the mad tsar had the architect blinded to ensure that he would never create such a masterpiece again.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After the Bolshevik Revolution, the cathedral was closed and in 1929 turned into a museum dedicated to the Russian conquest of Kazan. Although services are held here on Sunday at 10 AM, the museum is still open. The antechamber houses displays outlining the various stages of the Russian conquest of Kazan as well as examples of 16th-century Russian and Tatar weaponry. Another section details the history of the cathedral\'s construction, with displays of the building materials used. After viewing the museum exhibits, you\'re free to wander through the cathedral. Compared with the exotic exterior, the dark and simple interiors are somewhat disappointing. The brick walls are decorated with faded flower frescoes. The most interesting chapel is the main one, which contains a 19th-century baroque iconostasis. COST: 100R. OPEN: Daily 11-6. Closed 1st Mon. of month.

Founded by Ivan Vladimirovich Tsvetayev (1847-1913) of Moscow State University, father of poet Marina Tsvetaeva, the museum was originally established as a teaching aid for art students, which explains why a large part of its collection is made up of copies. The original building dates from 1895 to 1912 and was first known as the Alexander III Museum. It was renamed for Pushkin in 1937, on the centennial of the Russian poet\'s death. Next door, the <b>Musey Chastnykh Kollektsiy</b> (Museum of Private Collections) hosts some of the museum\'s most famous works and has separate hours and a small entrance fee.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The first-floor exhibit halls in the original building contain a fine collection of ancient Egyptian art (Hall 1); Greece and Rome are well represented, though mostly by copies (Room 7). The Italian school from the 15th century (Room 5) is represented by Botticelli\'s <i>The Annunciation,</i> Tomaso\'s <i>The Assassination of Caesar,</i> Guardi\'s <i>Alexander the Great at the Body of the Persian King Darius,</i> and Sano di Pietro\'s <i>The Beheading of John the Baptist,</i> among others. When you reach the Dutch School of the 17th Century (Hall 10), look for Rembrandt\'s <i>Portrait of an Old Woman,</i> whose subject may have been the artist\'s sister-in-law. Flemish and Spanish art from the 17th century are also well represented, with paintings by Murillo, Rubens, and Van Dyck (Hall 11).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The Museum of Private Collections</b> (tel. 495/203-1546. COST: 40R. OPEN: Wed.-Sun. noon-6) houses a stunning assortment of impressionist, postimpressionist, and modern art. There are many fine canvases by Picasso (Hall 17), including several from his \"blue\" period. The same hall contains fascinating works by Henri Rousseau, including <i>Jaguar Attacking a Horse.</i> There are 10 works by Gauguin, mainly in Hall 18, which also houses Cézanne\'s <i>Pierrot</i> and <i>Harlequin.</i> The museum owns several works by Matisse (Hall 21), although they\'re not all on display. In the same hall hangs the poignant <i>Landscape at Auvers After the Rain</i> by Vincent van Gogh. The collection ends at Hall 23, which has works by Degas, Renoir, and Monet, including Monet\'s <i>Rouen Cathedral at Sunset.</i>www.museum.ru/gmii. COST: 300R. OPEN: Tues.-Sun. 10-7.

In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Of the 16 German Länder, as the German federal states are called, none is more fiercely independent than Bavaria. In fact, it was an autonomous dukedom and later kingdom until 1871, when it was incorporated into the German nation state.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For Bavarians, anything beyond the state\'s borders remains foreign territory. The state has its own anthem and its own flag, part of which—the blue-and-white lozenges in the center—has virtually become a regional trademark symbolizing quality and tradition. Bavarian politicians discussing the issue of Europe in speeches will often refer to Bavaria almost as if it were a national state. They inevitably call it by its full official name: Freistaat Bayern, or simply der Freistaat, meaning \"the Free State.\" The term was coined by Kurt Eisner, Minister President of the Socialist government that rid the land of the Wittelsbach dynasty in 1918. It is simply a German way of saying republic—a land governed by the people. Bavaria\'s status as a republic is mentioned in the first line of the separate Bavarian constitution that was signed under the aegis of the American occupation forces in 1946.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bavaria is not the only Freistaat in Germany, a fact not too many Germans are aware of. Thuringia and Saxony also boast that title. But the Bavarians are the only ones who make such a public point of it. As they say, clocks in Bavaria run differently. Now you know why.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">All About German Beer</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">However many fingers you want to hold up, just remember the easy-to-pronounce <i>Bier</i> (beer) <i>Bit-te</i> (please) when ordering a beer. The tricky part is, Germans don\'t just produce <i>one</i> beverage called beer; they brew more than 5,000 varieties. Germany has about 1,300 breweries, 40% of the world\'s total. The hallmark of the country\'s dedication to beer is the Purity Law, <i>das Reinheitsgebot,</i> unchanged since Duke Wilhelm IV introduced it in Bavaria in 1516. The law decrees that only malted barley, hops, yeast, and water may be used to make beer, except for specialty Weiss- or Weizenbier (wheat beers, which are a carbonated, somewhat spicy, and sour brew, often with floating yeast particles).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most taverns have several drafts in addition to bottled beers. The type available depends upon the region you\'re in, and perhaps on the time of year. The alcohol content of German beers also varies. At the weaker end of the scale is the light Munich Helles (a lager, from 3.7% to 4.8% alcohol by volume); stronger brews are the bitter-flavored Pilsner (around 5%) and the dark Doppelbock (more than 7%).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In Munich you\'ll find the most famous breweries, the largest beer halls and beer gardens, the biggest and most indulgent beer festival, and the widest selection of brews. Even the beer glasses are bigger: a <i>Mass</i> is a 1-liter (almost 2-pint) serving; a <i>Halbe</i> is half liter and the standard size. The Hofbräuhaus is Munich\'s best-known beer hall, but its oompah band\'s selections are geared more to Americans and Australians than to your average Münchener. You\'ll find locals in one of the English Garden\'s four beer gardens or in the local <i>Wirtshaus</i> (tavern).</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Gullah (the word itself is believed to be derived from <i>Angola</i>), an English-based dialect rooted in African languages, is the unique language of the African-Americans of the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia, more than 300 years old. Most locally born African-Americans of the area can understand, if not speak, Gullah.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Descended from thousands of slaves who were imported by planters in the Carolinas during the 18th century, the Gullah people have maintained not only their dialect but also their heritage. Much of Gullah culture traces back to the African rice-coast culture and survives today in the art forms and skills, including sweetgrass basket-making, of Sea Islanders. During the colonial period, when rice was king, Africans from the West African rice kingdoms drew high premiums as slaves. Those with basket-making skills were extremely valuable because baskets were needed for agricultural and household use. Made by hand, sweetgrass baskets are intricate coils of a marsh grass with a sweet, haylike aroma.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nowhere is Gullah culture more evident than in the foods of the region. Rice appears at nearly every meal—Africans taught planters how to grow rice and how to cook and serve it as well. Lowcountry dishes use okra, peanuts, <i>benne</i> (the African word for sesame seeds), field peas, and hot peppers. Gullah food reflects the bounty of the islands: shrimp, crabs, oysters, fish, and such vegetables as greens, tomatoes, and corn. Many dishes are prepared in one pot, a method similar to the stew-pot cooking of West Africa.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On St. Helena Island, near Beaufort, Penn Center is the unofficial Gullah headquarters, preserving the culture and developing opportunities for Gullahs. In 1852 the first school for freed slaves was established at Penn Center. You can delve into the culture further at the York W. Bailey Museum.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On St. Helena, many Gullahs still go shrimping with hand-tied nets, harvest oysters, and grow their own vegetables. Nearby on Daufuskie Island, as well as on Edisto, Wadmalaw, and Johns islands near Charleston, you can find Gullah communities as well. A famous Gullah proverb says: <i>If oonuh ent kno weh oonuh dah gwine, oonuh should kno weh oonuh come f\'um.</i> Translation: If you don\'t know where you\'re going, you should know where you come from.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Many wineries have outdoor tables shaded by trees, and some sell snacks as well. (It\'s polite to buy a bottle of wine if you\'re using their picnic facilities.) Here are three terrific choices.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Napa Valley:</b> Stock up on high-falutin\' staples like pâté and imported cheeses at the Dean &amp; Deluca store on the St. Helena highway, 1½ mi south of downtown Napa. Then drive up to Rutherford Hill Winery to eat under their olive trees with a view of the valley.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Sonoma Valley:</b> Snap up local breads, cheeses, and other supplies at the stores around Sonoma\'s plaza, like the Cheesemaker\'s Daughter. Take your haul to Gundlach-Bundschu Winery, where the views from the slopes are unbeatable.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Russian River Valley:</b> Hit the Oakville Grocery on Healdsburg\'s main plaza, then have your spread at the tables at Rochioli Vineyards.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Best Wine Country Spas</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Wine Country spas have a natural edge on the treatments you can find elsewhere in the country. First, there are the natural mud baths and mineral water sources, concentrated particularly in northern Napa Valley\'s Calistoga. Admittedly, not everyone is enamored with dipping themselves in a thick, muddy paste. A mud bath sometimes smells sulfurous or peaty, and it takes a minute to get used to the intense heat as you submerge yourself. Once you\'ve lounged in it for several minutes, though, you may never want to leave, especially if an attendant has cooled your forehead with an icy wash cloth. Second, there are all those grapes, which are increasingly incorporated into treatments and products like grape-seed scrubs. Below are some of the best spas of the bunch.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Dr. Wilkinson\'s</b>. The oldest spa in Calistoga. Although it\'s perhaps the least chic of the bunch, it\'s still well-loved for its reasonable prices and its friendly, unpretentious vibe. They use a mix of volcanic ash and peat moss in their mud baths. 1507 Lincoln Ave., Calistoga. tel. 707/942-4102. www.drwilkinson.com.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn &amp; Spa</b>. The highest sybaritic profile in the Wine Country. The vast complex covers every amenity you could want in a spa, including several pools and Jacuzzis fed by local thermal mineral springs. 100 Boyes Blvd., /Rte. 12, Boyes Hot Springs. tel. 707/938-9000. www.sonomamissioninn.com.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Health Spa Napa Valley</b>. Focuses on health and wellness, with personal trainers and an outdoor pool in addition to the usual spa fare. The grape-seed mud wrap, during which you\'re slathered with mud mixed with crushed Napa Valley grape seeds, is a more decadent alternative to a mud bath. 1030 Main St., St. Helena. tel. 707/967-8800. www.napavalleyspa.com.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Kenwood Inn &amp; Spa</b>. The prettiest spa setting in the Wine Country, thanks to the vineyards across the road and the Mediterranean style of the inn. It specializes in Caudalíe\'s \"vinotherapie\" treatments, with massages, scrubs, and facials based on grape extracts. 10400 Sonoma Hwy., /Rte. 12, Kenwood. tel. 707/833-1293. www.kenwoodinn.com.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Lavender Hill Spa</b>.

Top that with a bird\'s-eye view! Several companies offer hot-air ballooning trips over Napa and Sonoma. Rides usually cost between $200 and $250, last about an hour, and include brunch or lunch after the flight. (Many companies drop their rates a bit in the off-season.)

Veeder 9 mi northwest of the city of Napa. (Don\'t give up; the road leading to the winery is long and winding.) The simple, rustic limestone structure, circa 1903, contains Swiss owner Donald Hess\'s personal art collection, including mostly large-scale works by such contemporary European and American artists as Robert Motherwell, Francis Bacon, and Frank Stella. Cabernet sauvignon is the real strength here, though Hess also produces some fine chardonnays. The winery and the art collection are open for self-guided tours (free). www.hesscollection.com. COST: Tasting $10-$25. OPEN: Daily 10-5, tasting until 4. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">di Rosa Preserve</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When you\'re driving along the Carneros Highway on your way to Napa from San Francisco, it would be easy to zip by one of the region\'s best-kept secrets: the. Metal sculptures of sheep grazing in the grass mark the entrance to this sprawling, art-stuffed property. Thousands of 20th-century artworks by hundreds of Northern California artists crop up everywhere—in galleries, in the former di Rosa residence, on every lawn, in every courtyard, and even on the lake. If you stop by without a reservation, you can only gain access to the Gatehouse Gallery, where there\'s a small collection of riotously colorful figurative and abstract sculpture and painting. For the full effect, reserve ahead for a one-hour tour of the grounds, or opt for the two-hour tour, which allows more time to browse the main gallery. www.dirosapreserve.org. COST: $3, tours $10-$15. OPEN: Tues.-Fri. 9:30-3; call for tour times. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Far Niente</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though the fee for the combined tour and tasting is one of the highest in the valley, Far Niente is especially worth visiting if you\'re tired of elbowing your way through crowded tasting rooms and are looking for a more personal experience. Here you\'re welcomed by name and treated to a glimpse of one of the most beautiful Napa properties. Small groups are shepherded through the historic 1885 stone winery for a session on the labor-intensive method for making Far Niente\'s well-regarded cabernets and chardonnays. The next stop is the Carriage House, where you can see the founder\'s gleaming collection of classic racecars. The tour ends with a seated tasting of wines and cheeses, capped by a sip of the spectacular Dolce, a late-harvest dessert wine made by Far Niente\'s sister winery. www.farniente.com. COST: $50. OPEN: Tasting and tour by appointment. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Schramsberg</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Schramsberg, hidden on the hillside near Route 29, is one of Napa\'s oldest wineries and produces a variety of bubblies made using the traditional <i>méthode champenoise</i> process. If you want to taste, you must tour first, but what a tour: in addition to seeing the winery\'s historic architecture, you can get to tour the cellars dug in the late 19th century by Chinese laborers, where a mind-boggling 2 million bottles are stacked in gravity-defying configurations. The tour fee includes generous pours of three very different sparkling wines, as well as one still wine. www.schramsberg.com. COST: Tasting and tour $25. OPEN: Daily 10-4; tasting and tour by appointment. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Frog\'s Leap</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Frog\'s Leap is the perfect place for wine novices to begin their education. The owners, the Williams family, maintain a goofy sense of humor about wine that translates into an entertaining yet informative experience. Why resist a place that dubs one of its wines Leapfrögmilch? They also happen to produce some very fine zinfandel, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, and sauvignon blanc. They pride themselves on the sustainability of their operation, and the tour guides can tell you about their organic farming and solar power techniques. The winery includes a red barn built in 1884, an ecofriendly visitor center, and, naturally, a frog pond topped with lily pads. www.frogsleap.com. COST: Tasting and tour free.

With Italian unification in 1860 it became exclusively so, housing the fabulous Farnese collection, which is now accompanied by finds from Herculaneum, Pompeii, Capua, and other parts of Magna Grecia (as Southern Italy was once known).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The origins of the collection can be traced in part to some dynastic luck. The Farnese family\'s last surviving member, Elizabetta, was married to Philip V of Spain. On her death in 1766, her son, the Bourbon Charles III, King of Naples and Sicily, was left with one of the biggest cultural heirlooms of all time. The Farnese family had from Renaissance times used its papal offices to gain something of a monopoly on antiquities, not to mention works by the Renaissance masters. When one of the family married a Medici princess, they acquired the Medici collection as well. A further windfall came in their taking over the collection of another papal family, the Orsinis.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The 1587 will of Cardinal Alexander Farnese—later Pope Paolo III—stipulated that the collection remain in Rome. Risking the disapproval of then Pope Pius VI, Charles\'s son Ferdinand ignored the dictate and arranged for the transfer of probably the world\'s most valuable batch of statues to Naples. Hercules, Zeus, Athena, and Venere Callipige headed south, along with satyrs, gladiators, and fauns, eventually to be put on display in 1801. (Most can now be seen on the ground floor.) Unlike many other works in Italy, they escaped further kidnapping to France under the Napoleonic occupation, thanks to the efforts of Naples governor Joachim Murat.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With the restoration of Ferdinand, the museum acquired a new name, the Royal Bourbon Museum, and a considerable expansion to house stunning finds from Pompeii and Herculaneum—most of which are now on the first floor. With works like these being unearthed, it\'s no surprise that <i>la febbre da rovine</i> (ruin fever) set in and Naples became a top venue on the Grand Tour circuit.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It didn\'t hurt the museum\'s popularity when Francesco II (1825-30) opened the Gabinetto Secreto (Secret Cabinet) to display X-rated finds from Pompeii. After a visit to the museum with his wife and daughter, the same Francesco decided the exhibit should have limited access. Garibaldi on Italian Unification declared the restrictions on the Cabinet to be a symbol of Bourbon backwardness and pledged to reopen it. During the 20th century it was closed again, only becoming totally accessible in 2000.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">During World War II, the museum\'s collection was moved to Montecassino to escape the Allied bombing of Naples. (Fortunately, unlike many churches, the museum was not hit.) When things turned dangerous at Montecassino, the collection ended up for a while in the Vatican Museums in Rome—their original home—only returning to Naples after the war.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pompeii Prep</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pompeii is impressive under any circumstances, but it comes alive if you do some preparation before your visit.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">First, read up—there are piles of good books on the subject, including these engaging, jargon-free histories: <i>Pompeii: The Day a City Died</i> by Robert Etienne, <i>Pompeii: Public and Private Life</i> by Paul Zanker, and <i>The Lost World of Pompeii</i> by Colin Amery. For accurate historical information woven into the pages of a thriller, pick up <i>Pompeii: A Novel</i> by Robert Harris.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Second, be sure to visit the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples, where most of the finest art from Pompeii now resides. The museum is a remarkable treasure trove—it\'s a rewarding place to visit even if Pompeii isn\'t in your plans.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The institution\'s aim was to carry out acts of Christian charity: feeding the hungry, clothing the poor, nursing the sick, sheltering pilgrims, visiting prisoners, ransoming Christian slaves, and burying the indigent dead—acts immortalized in the history of art by the famous altarpiece painted by Caravaggio (1571-1610) depicting the <i>Sette Opere della Misericordia</i> (or <i>Seven Acts of Mercy</i>) and now the celebrated focus of the church. In this haunting work the artist has brought the Virgin in palpable glory, unforgettably borne atop the shoulders of two angels, right down into the street—and not a rhetorical place, but a real street of Spaccanapoli (scholars have in fact suggested a couple of plausible identifications) populated by figures in whose spontaneous and passionate movements the people could see themselves given great dignity. Along with other paintings in the church, the sculptures by Andrea Falcone on its porch refer to this commitment. The original church was considered too small and destroyed in 1655 to make way for the new church, designed by Antonio Picchiatti in 1658-78.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The extraordinary expressiveness and efficiency of the Caravaggio altarpiece can be judged by comparison with the church\'s other paintings, commissioned from Neapolitan painters after Caravaggio hit the road again (to Malta) to stay one step ahead of the law. In particular, in the painting to the left of the altar, <i>St. Peter Rescuing Tabitha</i> (1612), Fabrizio Santafede is clearly struggling to modify his Technicolor formalist style to suggest the dramatic impact of the altarpiece—but the figures here merely occupy the space of the painting, rather than animate it. Upon seeing Caravaggio\'s altarpiece, a number of artists changed their styles radically, although often giving a personal interpretation to one aspect of Caravaggio\'s style. The painting to the right of the exit door is a beautiful work by one of the best of the Neapolitan Caravaggesques, Giovan Battista Carraciolo, who was 29 years old when the slightly older artist came to town. Depicting the <i>Liberation of St. Peter</i> (1615), the composition is almost shockingly spartan, nearly all dark brown with contained blocks of white, red, and flesh tones. For more paintings of the Neapolitan Seicento, head up the staircase to the church\'s small <b>Pinacoteca,</b> a museum of 17th- and 18th-century paintings. www.piomontedellamisericordia.it.

Metro: Piazza Cavour (in construction: Duomo). </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Teatro San Carlo</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">La Scala in Milan is the famous one, but San Carlo is more beautiful, and Naples is, after all, the most operatic of cities. Built in eight months and 10 days in 1737 by Angelo Carasale for Charles III of Bourbon—and opened on the king\'s saint\'s name day—it burned down in 1816 and was rebuilt, with its facade of five rustic gray arches surmounted by an elegant loggia, in a mere nine months. This time the architect was Antonio Niccolini, working under the impetus of Domenico Barbaja, the Milanese director appointed by Joachim Murat in 1810. Barbaja, San Carlo\'s most legendary director, started out as a waiter in a tavern and enriched himself through a talent for gambling. Obviously wanting to remain part of the new regime, he bet the king that he could have the theater open within nine months. More important, he also managed in the same year to convince Gioacchino Rossini to come to Naples as conductor and house composer; Stendhal hailed Ferdinand\'s wise retaining of Barbaja and his prompt sponsorship of the theater as a \"coup d\'état\" for the deep and immediate bond it created between the ruler and his opera-loving populace. This was further cemented by the many operas composed for the house, including Donizetti\'s <i>Lucia di Lammermoor</i> and Rossini\'s <i>La Donna del Lago.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the theater, nearly 200 boxes are arranged on six levels, and the huge stage (12,000 square feet) permits productions with horses, camels, and elephants and even boasts a removable backdrop that can lift to reveal the Palazzo Reale Gardens. Above the rich red-and-gold auditorium is a breathy ceiling fresco, by Giuseppe Cammarano, suitably representing Apollo presenting poets to Athena. At many performances, however, all eyes strayed to the sumptuous royal box, which seats 15 and is topped by a gigantic gilded crown. Check the San Carlo Web site, the local press (<i>Il Mattino, La Repubblica, Corriere della Sera</i>), or the <i>Qui Napoli</i> for information on performances, or pick up the annual program at the ticket office and get ready for a great evening of opera. Performance standards are among the highest in Europe at the San Carlo—even the great Enrico Caruso was hissed here—although some locals really come to study the fashion show in the auditorium, not the Verdi on stage. If you can\'t catch a performance, try to take the 30-minute guided tour (EUR 5) to see the splendid theater—as Stendhal wrote: \"The first impression one gets is of being suddenly transported to the palace of an oriental emperor.

The fashionable church for the nobility in the 14th century, and a favorite Angevin church from the start, Santa Chiara was intended to be a great dynastic monument by Robert d\'Anjou. His second wife, Sancia di Majorca, added the adjoining convent for the Poor Clares to a monastery of the Franciscan Minors so she could vicariously satisfy a lifelong desire for the cloistered seclusion of a convent; this was the first time the two sexes were combined in a single complex. Built in a Provençal Gothic style between 1310 and 1328 (probably by Guglielmo Primario) and dedicated in 1340, the church had its aspect radically altered, as did so many others, in the baroque period, when the original wooden roof was replaced with a vault dripping in stuccos. A six-day fire started by Allied bombs on August 4, 1943, put an end to all that, as well as to what might have been left of the important cycle of frescoes by Giotto and his Neapolitan workshop: Giorgio Vasari, writing in the mid-16th century, tells us that the paintings covered the entire church. The most important tomb in the church towers behind the altar. Sculpted by Giovanni and Pacio Bertini of Florence (1343-45), it is, fittingly, the tomb of the founding king: the great Robert d\'Anjou, known as the Wise. To the right of the altar is the tomb of Carlo, duke of Calabria, a majestic composition by Tino da Camaino and assistants (1326-33), and answering it on the side wall is Tino\'s last work, the tomb of Carlo\'s wife, Marie de Valois.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Around the left side of the church at Via Santa Chiara 49/c is a gate leading to the <b>Chiostro delle Clarisse,</b> the most famous cloister in Naples. It\'s clear here that we are not dealing with any normal convent; the benches and octagonal columns upholding the trellis of vine shading this privileged garden comprise a light-handed masterpiece of painted majolica designed by Domenico Antonio Vaccaro, with a delightful profusion of landscapes and light yellow and green floral motifs realized by Donato and Giuseppe Massa and their studio (1742). Where the real vines leave off and the painted ones take over was once hard to say, but much of the cloister is now being replanted, so the complete effect is missing. The elegant 14th-century porch around the garden is enlivened by fading frescoes. In the back corner you can enter the Museo dell\'Opera, built on the visible remains of an old Roman bath establishment and containing some interesting sculptural fragments from the damaged church (look for Giovanni da Nola\'s moving wooden <i>Ecce Homo</i> of 1519 on the upper floor) and objects illustrating life in the cloister. www.santachiara.info. COST: Museum and cloister EUR 5. OPEN: Church: daily 7-12:30 and 4:30-6:30. Museum and cloister: Mon.-Sat. 9:30-5:30, Sun. 9:30-2. Metro: Dante (in construction: Piazza Borsa-Università). </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Castel dell\'Ovo</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The oldest castle in Naples, the Castel dell\'Ovo sits on the most picturesque point of the bay, standing guard over the city it protects. Occupying the isle of Megaris, it was originally the site of the Roman villa of Lucullus—proof, if you need it, that the ancient Romans knew a premium location when they saw one (for the same reason, some of the city\'s top hotels share the same site today). By the 12th century, it had become a fortress under the Normans; it was once the prison of Conradin and of Beatrice, daughter of Manfred, last of the Hohenstaufen rulers. The castle\'s gigantic rooms, rock tunnels, and belvederes over the bay are among Naples\' most striking sights as well as a magical setting for the temporary contemporary-art exhibitions sponsored by the city council.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You enter the castle not through its main entrance with its forbidding trio of cannons, but by descending the steps on the left into the sleepy Borgo Marinaio. Continue alongside the forbidding castle walls and, opposite Oste Pazzo, enter the Spartan hall. An elevator takes you up to the battlement level. Walk up to the roof\'s Sala della Terrazze for a postcard-come-true view of Ischia. Then, as the odd car honk drifts across from inland, use the tiled map to identify the sights of the city and maybe plot an itinerary for the rest of the day.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As for the egg of the castle\'s name, the poet Virgil, rather anachronistically, is supposed have hidden an egg in the walls. The egg, like the blood of San Gennaro, was believed to have protective powers, but only as long as it remained intact. If it broke, disaster would strike. The belief was taken so seriously that when in the 15th century under there was an earthquake, followed by a Hungarian invasion, followed by a plague, Queen Giovanna I brought forth an intact egg, solemnly declaring it to be the Virgilian original, in order to quell the people\'s panic. COST: Free. OPEN: Weekdays 8-2. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cappella Sansevero</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rightly one of the emblematic monuments of Naples in the popular imagination, this dazzling masterpiece, the funerary chapel of the Sangro di Sansevero princes, combines noble swagger, overwhelming color, and a touch of the macabre—which is to say, it expresses Naples perfectly. The di Sangros were renowned military leaders as far back as the Dark Ages, and they boast no fewer than six saints in their family (who are portrayed in the chapel\'s painted roundels between the windows). The chapel was begun in 1590 by Giovan Francesco di Sangro, the result of a vow to be fulfilled if he were cured of a dire illness. He lived for another 14 years, which was good for the building campaign, but the present aspect of the chapel is due to his descendant Raimondo di Sangro, prince of Sansevero, who had it completely redone between 1749 and 1770. (His tomb and portrait are halfway down on the right.)</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Youthful portraits show this fascinating character with a pronounced pointy chin. Confident and sophisticated in his tastes, legendarily brilliant, and an important mover in Naples\' Enlightenment, this princely intellectual, mad scientist, and inventor was accused of just about everything then considered base: atheism, alchemy, and Freemasonry. The last two are likely: he seems to have been a Grand Master of the Freemasons, and his claim to be able to reproduce the miracle of San Gennaro\'s blood got him kicked out of the Fraternity of the Treasure of San Gennaro. He left a personal touch in the basement, down the stairs to the right, where two glass cases house a pair of \"anatomical machines,\" which are astonishing even if fake. Purporting to be an encyclopedic reconstruction of the blood vessels of an adult male and a pregnant female, they are supposedly based on two of the prince\'s servants, who fell victim to his curiosity when he injected them while still alive with what is conjectured to be a mercury solution that hardened their arteries.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Prince Raimondo is generally credited with the design of the splendid marble-inlay floor; he hired Francesco Maria Russo to paint the ceiling with a <i>Glory of Paradise</i> (1749) and also hired a team of up-and-coming sculptors, whose contributions remain the focal point for most visits here: the showpiece is smack in the middle of the chapel, Giuseppe Sammartino\'s <i>Veiled Christ</i> (1753). The artist was only 33 years old when he sculpted this famous work, which was originally meant to be placed in the crypt. It was too good to leave down below<i>;</i> the audacious virtuosity of the clinging drapery showing the wounds underneath is one of the marvels of Neapolitan sculpture. A taste for the outré and extravagant had already been demonstrated by other statues in the chapel, especially Francesco Quierolo\'s <i>Disillusion,</i> to the right of the altar, with its chisel-defying net making a spectacular transition to empty space. This Genovese sculptor also did the female statue representing <i>Sincerity</i> on the right and the commemorative <i>Altar to St. Odorisio</i> between the two Allegories. Antonio Corradini, who came to Naples from the Veneto region via Rome, is responsible for the allegorical statue to the left of the altar, <i>Veiled Modesty</i> (1751), widely considered his masterpiece; he also sculpted the funerary monument and allegorical figure of <i>Decorum,</i> on the inside of the front wall to the right of the exit. Francesco Celebrano contributed the stunning funerary monument above the front door, depicting Cecco di Sangro in of one of his most famous moments: believed dead in battle, he was set in a coffin, only to climb out again wielding a sword and ready to fight. www.museosansevero.it. COST: EUR 6. OPEN: Mon. and Wed.-Fri. 10-5:10, weekends 10-1:10. Metro: Dante. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museo Archeologico Nazionale</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Those who know and love this legendary museum have the tendency upon hearing it mentioned to heave a sigh: it\'s famous not only for its unrivaled collections but also for its off-limit rooms, missing identification labels, poor lighting, billows of dust, suffocating heat in summer, and indifferent personnel—a state of affairs seen by some critics as an encapsulation of everything that\'s wrong with southern Italy in general.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Precisely because of this emblematic value, the National Ministry of Culture has decided to lavish attention and funds on the museum in a complete reorganization. This process has been ongoing for some time and looks as if it will continue for a while longer. Ticketing has been privatized and opening hours extended (for the center-core \"masterpiece\" collection, that is; other rooms are subject to staffing shortages and can be closed on a rotating basis). Some of the \"newer\" rooms, covering archaeological discoveries in the Greco-Roman settlements and necropolises in and around Naples, have helpful informational panels in English. A fascinating display (free) of the finds unearthed during digs for the Naples metro has been set up in the Museo station close to the museum entrance.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Even if some rooms may be closed, this still leaves available the core of the museum, a nucleus of world-renowned archaeological finds that puts most other museums to shame. It includes the legendary Farnese collection of ancient sculpture, together with local sculptural finds, and almost all the good stuff—the best mosaics and paintings—from Pompeii and Herculaneum. The quality of these collections is unexcelled and, as far as the mosaic, painting, and bronze sections are concerned, unique in the world.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As you enter the building, the ticket booth is on your right opposite the bookshop. To view the remarkable Farnese collection of ancient marble sculpture, take the right-hand corridor at the end of the entrance atrium and follow the signs. If you\'re going to devote some time to the museum, though, it makes more sense to start your visit on the top floor, which contains some of the more demanding works on the eye, and work your way down. It\'s worthwhile to invest in an up-to-date printed museum guide, as exhibits are generally poorly labeled, and have a habit of changing location. Alternatively, you might try the audioguide (EUR 6; ID required), though for a collection of this magnitude it is woefully incomplete. www.archeona.arti.beniculturali.it. COST: EUR 6.50, EUR 10 for special exhibits. OPEN: Wed.-Mon. 9-7. Metro: Museo. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Certosa di San Martino</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Atop a rocky promontory with a fabulous view of the entire city, and with majestic salons that would please any monarch, the Certosa di San Martino is a monastery that seems more like a palace. In fact, by the 18th century Ferdinand IV was threatening to halt the order\'s government subsidy, so sumptuous was this <i>certosa,</i> or charter house, which had been started in 1325 under the royal patronage of Charles of Anjou. With the Carthusians\' vast wealth and love of art, it was only a matter of time before dour Angevin Gothic was traded in for varicolored Neapolitan Baroque, thanks to the contributions of many 17th- and 18th-century sculptors and painters. Although the Angevin heritage can be seen in the pointed arches and cross-vaulted ceiling of the Certosa Church across the courtyard just opposite the ticket barrier, the church was overhauled from 1631 onward, partly as a response to Naples\' deliverance from Vesuvius the same year.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The sacristy leads into the later Cappella del Tesoro, with Luca Giordano\'s ceiling fresco of Judith holding aloft Holofernes\'s head and the painting by Il Ribera (the <i>Pietà</i> over the altar is one of his masterpieces). The main baroque style note was set by Cosimo Fanzago (1591-1678), an architect, sculptor, and decorator who was as devout as he was mad. His polychrome marble work is at its finest here in the church, while he displays a gamut of sculptural skills in the <b>Chiostro Grande</b> (Great Cloister), also adding the curious small monks\' graveyard, bounded by a marble balustrade topped with marble skulls. Fanzago\'s ceremonial portals at each corner of the cloister are among the most spectacular of all baroque creations—aswirl with Mannerist volutes and Michelangelo-esque ornament, they serve as mere frames for six life-size statues of Carthusian saints, who sit atop the doorways, judging all with deathless composure.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just by the entrance to the monastery\'s terraced gardens is the <b>Quarto del Priore,</b> which was the residence of the only monk who had any contact with the outside world. It\'s an extravaganza filled with frescoes, 18th-century majolica-tile floors, and paintings, with extensive gardens where scenic <i>pergolati</i> (roofed balconies) overlook the bay—a domicile that might be called the very vestibule of heaven.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most of the monastery, which was suppressed in 1831, now serves as a museum. For a sound introduction to monastic life and a well-signposted history of the Carthusians and San Martino, see the panoramic renovated galleries of the <b>Museo dell\'Opera</b> around the Chiostro Grande. Room 24 has a helpful 18th-century scale model of the monastic complex; Room 26 has 19th-century paintings of monastic life. Dalbono\'s 13 gouaches of Vesuvius in various angry poses are attractively displayed in Room 28. If you\'re beginning to think that the 17th century in Naples was all grand masters and opulence, Room 37 and the various paintings depicting the plague might change that impression.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nearby, the <b>Sezione Presepiale,</b> open only during the winter holiday season, holds the greatest collection of Nativity crèches in the world. Ranging in size from a nutshell to an entire room, they offer supreme evocations of 18th-century life. Many figures are garbed in exquisite costumes and have portraitlike faces. The most noted is the <i>Presepe Cuciniello,</i> with more than 160 shepherds, eight dogs, countless angels, Moors, chickens, cheese wheels, beggars, and dwarfs, all worshipping the Holy Family against a brilliant blue sky. COST: EUR 6 includes admission to Castel Sant\'Elmo. OPEN: Thurs.-Tues. 8:30-7:30. Some rooms are often closed (Quarto del Priore) depending on staffing.

You\'ll see right away why this cave was chosen as an exotic setting for such movies as 007\'s <i>Thunderball</i> and <i>Never Say Never Again,</i> and the mermaid tale <i>Splash.</i></div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Great Guana Cay</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The essence of Great Guana Cay can be summed up by its unofficial motto, painted on a hand-lettered sign: it\'s better in the bahamas, but. it\'s gooder in guana. This sliver of an islet just off Great Abaco, accessible by ferry from Marsh Harbour or by private boat, is the kind of place people picture when they dream of running off to disappear on an exotic island, complete with alluring deserted beaches and grassy dunes. Only 100 full-time residents live on 7-mi-long Great Guana Cay, where you\'re more likely to run into a rooster than a car during your stroll around the tranquil village. Still, there are just enough luxuries here to make your stay comfortable, including a couple of small, laid-back resorts, and a restaurant-bar with one of the best party scenes in the Abacos. The island also offers easy access to bonefishing flats you can explore on your own. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Harbour Island</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Harbour Island has often been called the Nantucket of the Caribbean and the prettiest of the Out Islands because of its 3 mi of powdery pink-sand beach and its pastel-color clapboard houses with dormer windows, set among white picket fences, narrow lanes, quaint shops, and tropical flowers. The frequent parade of fashionable celebrities—supermodel Elle MacPherson has a home here, and Michael Bolton and Nicolette Sheridan got engaged at the romantic Pink Sands resort—and the chic small inns that accommodate them has earned the island another name: the St. Barths of the Bahamas. But residents have long called it Briland, their faster way of pronouncing \"Harbour Island.\" The best way to get around is to rent a golf cart or bike; or hire a taxi, since climbing the island\'s hills can be quite strenuous in the midday heat. Some of the Bahamas\' most attractive small hotels, each strikingly distinct, are tucked within the island\'s 2 square mi. At several perched on a bluff above the shore, you can fall asleep with the windows open and listen to the waves lapping the beach. Harbour Island is reached via a 10-minute ferry ride from the North Eleuthera dock. Fares are $5 per person in a boat of two or more, plus an extra dollar to be dropped off at the private docks of Romora Bay Club. The ferry also occasionally charges more for nighttime rides.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Old trees line the narrow streets of <b>Dunmore Town,</b> named after the 18th-century royal governor of the Bahamas, Lord Dunmore, who built a summer home here and laid out the town. The community was once second in the country to Nassau in terms of its prosperity. It\'s the only town on Harbour Island, and you can take in all its attractions during a 20-minute stroll. Stop first at the <b>Harbour Island Tourist Office</b> (tel. 242/333-2621), in the yellow building opposite the ferry dock. Get a map and ask about current events. Across the street is a row of straw-work stands, including Dorothea\'s, Pat\'s, and Sarah\'s, where you\'ll find straw bags, hats, and T-shirts. Food stands sell conch salad, Kalik beer, coconut water, and fruit juices.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On Dunmore Street, you can visit the Bahamas\' oldest Anglican church, <b>St. John\'s,</b> built in 1768, and the distinguished 1848 <b>Wesley Methodist Church.</b> Both hold services. On Bay Street, <b>Loyalist Cottage,</b> one of the original settlers\' homes (circa 1797), has also survived. Many other old houses in the area, with gingerbread trim and picket fences, have such amusing names as \"Beside the Point,\" \"Up Yonder,\" and \"The Royal Termite.\" Off the eastern Atlantic shore lies a long coral reef, which protects the beach and has excellent snorkeling. You can see multicolor fish and a few old wrecks. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Sweet, succulent, and sinfully rich, it\'s the ultimate buttery icon of a Connecticut summer. Other New England states may prefer to chill out with lobster rolls created from a cool mix of lobster meat, mayonnaise, and chopped celery, but Nutmeggers like their one-of-a-kind rolls served hot, hot, hot.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The traditional Connecticut lobster roll, said to have been invented in the early 1930s at Perry\'s, a now-defunct seafood shack on the Boston Post Road in Milford, consists of nothing more than plump chunks of hot lobster meat and melted butter served on a butter-toasted roll. In other words: heaven on a bun. From seafood shanties along the shore to more gourmet getaways farther inland, Connecticut is fairly swimming with eateries that offer these revered rolls. Three favorites: A roll at <b>Abbott\'s Lobster in the Rough</b> (117 Pearl St., Noank. tel. 860/536-7719. www.abbotts-lobster.com.

When artists such as Willard Metcalf, Clark Voorhees, Childe Hassam, and Henry Ward Ranger flocked to the area to paint its varied landscape, Miss Florence offered housing as well as artistic encouragement. The house was turned into a museum in 1947 and underwent a major restoration completed in 2006, which restored it to its appearance in 1910, when the colony was in full flower (clues to the house\'s layout and decor in that era were provided by many of the members\' paintings).

Perhaps most remarkable is a sprawling \"immersion environment\"—a 16th-century village with more than 50 life-size figures and real smells and sounds—in which you use audio devices to obtain detailed information about the sights. The research center, open to scholars and schoolchildren free of charge, holds some 150,000 volumes.

It was the world\'s first Sazerac. According to legend, Peychaud served his invention in a traditional French egg cup called a coquetier, which was soon mispronounced by his American clients and turned into the word cocktail. In the 200 years since then, the landscape of New Orleans has changed, but the spirit remains the same as people pursue the sublime pleasure of drinking a chilled, perfectly made cocktail in the warmth of this subtropical city. From the world-renowned Hurricane to Peychaud\'s now-famous bitters, New Orleans is home to many of the greatest inventions and ingredients in cocktail history.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In recent years, a new generation of bar owners, bartenders, and \"mixologists,\" as they\'re known, have reinvigorated the entire cocktail culture of New Orleans, bringing a new energy and zeal to the traditional world of bars and drinks. With top-shelf liquors, fresh ingredients, and inventive recipes, bartenders and mixologists are ushering in what some observers call a \"cocktail revolution,\" by combining the traditional skills and history of New Orleans drink making with unparalleled inventiveness and access to uncommon ingredients. On any given night patrons can take a spin through history, ordering drinks like the Sazerac, the Ramos Gin Fizz, or the Obituary Cocktail at venues like the <b>Sazerac Bar</b>, the <b>Napoleon House</b>, or <b>Lafitte\'s Blacksmith Shop</b>. Or drop into trendy new bars like <b>Bar Tonique</b>, <b>Clever</b>, <b>Cure</b>, or <b>loa</b> for modern inventions such as the Oriole, the Window Box, the Tequila Old-Fashioned, or the loatini.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Celebrating its unique position in the history of cocktail culture, New Orleans boasts some of the most interesting museums dedicated to the art of drinking. <b>The Museum of the American Cocktail</b> (Southern Food &amp; Beverage Museum, Riverwalk Marketplace, 1 Poydras St., Warehouse, 70130. tel. 504/569-0405. www.museumoftheamericancocktail.org) hosts an extensive collection of rare spirits, books, Prohibition-era literature and music, vintage cocktail shakers, glassware, tools, gadgets, and all manner of cocktail memorabilia and photographs culled from the outstanding collections of museum founders and patrons.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Absinthe Museum of America</b> (823 Royal St., French Quarter, 701160. tel. 504/523-0903. www.absinthemuseumofamerica.com) is the first of its kind in the United States, showcasing a rare and extensive collection of antique items, including fountains, hundreds of spoons, glasses, saucers, drippers, labels, prints, and topettes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Each July the annual Tales of the Cocktail, billed as \"the most spirited event of the summer,\" brings thousands of experts and enthusiasts together for an internationally acclaimed, five-day celebration dedicated to the artistry and science of making drinks.

Louis Armstrong Park, on the northern edge of the French Quarter, contains the original Congo Square site.

Songwriter, vocalist, banjoist, guitarist, storyteller, and jazz historian Danny Barker performed from the 1930s all the way up to his death in 1994 and was a vital intergenerational link for New Orleans jazz musicians. Barker organized the Fairview Baptist Church Brass Band, whose alumni include Wynton and Branford Marsalis, Anthony \"Tuba Fats\" Lacen, and Charles and Kirk Joseph of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band. He worked through the 1970s as assistant curator of the New Orleans Jazz Museum and, leading his Onward Brass Band, encouraged younger players to keep Dixieland jazz alive. 1027-1029 Chartres St., French Quarter, 70116.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>George Vitale \"Papa Jack\" Laine\'s House</b>.

In the French Quarter you can pick up classic pralines at <b>Aunt Sally\'s Praline Shop</b> or <b>Laura\'s Candies,</b> which also sell other to-go items. Don\'t forget beignet mix and chicory coffee to recreate breakfast at <b>Café du Monde.</b> In the Warehouse District, <b>Riverwalk Marketplace</b> has candy shops that will make fudge and pralines while you watch, then package them for you to take home. Stores like <b>New Orleans School of Cooking and Louisiana General Store</b> not only provide the ingredients you need to create New Orleans dishes in your own kitchen, they\'ll even give you cooking classes to help you do it right. All the city\'s bookstores and many gift shops are stocked with a variety of cookbooks by local chefs and tomes about the area\'s foods. Uptown, stop in <b>Savvy Gourmet</b> for packaged gourmet mixes, cooking lessons, and samples of the foods you\'ll want to remember.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bright Lights, Big Easy</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One legacy of New Orleans\'s Caribbean cultural climate that comes as a pleasant shock to many visitors is the city\'s tolerant attitude toward alcohol. Most bars stay open as long as a crowd is on hand: with 24-hour liquor licenses, closing time is strictly voluntary. Revelers can leave a bar and take their drinks along in a \"go-cup.\" Whiskey, beer, or wine can be purchased anywhere, anytime, at such unlikely outlets as gas stations or drive-through daiquiri depots. And beware, liquor used to mix drinks is rarely measured. New Orleans bartenders are generous people.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many bars advertise the Hurricane—a rum-and-fruit concoction that is the signature drink at <b>Pat O\'Brien\'s,</b> the best place to order one.

The storm felled or damaged more than 1,000 trees, destroyed an 18-hole golf course, ravaged vegetation, and forced the park to lay off 90% of its staff. Nevertheless, the park has been rebuilt with the help of hundreds of local and visiting volunteers and is again a great place to walk or jog, play tennis, feed the ducks, visit one of its attractions, or simply relax. Just beyond the main entrance at the end of Esplanade Avenue stands the <b>New Orleans Museum of Art</b> and an adjacent sculpture garden; tucked elsewhere in the sprawling park are tennis courts, a sports stadium and running track, baseball diamonds and playgrounds, equestrian stable and golf course, along with miles of meandering walking paths and gentle lagoons rife with waterfowl. The park\'s art-deco benches, fountains, bridges, and ironwork are remnants of a 1930s Works Progress Administration refurbishment, and whimsical sculptures by renowned New Orleans artist Enrique Alferez dot the <b>New Orleans Botanical Garden</b>. The train garden here, operating on weekends only, is still a fun stop for the kids. Other children\'s favorites, Storyland and Carousel Gardens, are also open seasonally on weekends. Most attractions are clustered near the museum, but a stroll or picnic anywhere in the park is a wonderful way to relax. A popular drive-through Christmas holiday light display had to be scaled down after Katrina, but a walking tour and activities beginning annually after Thanksgiving pack in holiday revelers.

American architect William Brand built the house in 1831. The house fortunately sustained only minor damage during Katrina and is open for visits and tours. Cooking demonstrations on the open hearth are held here all day Thursday from October through May. You\'ll want to check the gift shop, which has many local crafts and books.

Located just upriver of the New Orleans Convention Center, the massive 400,000-square-foot complex occupies the former Delta Queen Steamboat terminal and River City Casino sites right along the Mississippi River. The new Mardi Gras World brings the fun of its west bank predecessor closer to the city center with an enhanced guided tour through a maze of video presentations, decorative sculptures, and favorite megafloats from Mardi Gras parades such as Bacchus, Rex, and Endymion. Visitors enter through a plantation alley that is part Cajun swamp-shack village, partantebellum Disneyworld (Kern was a friend of, and inspired by, Walt Disney). If you\'re not here for the real thing, Mardi Gras World is a fun (and family friendly) backstage look at the history and artistry of Carnival. Admission includes cake and coffee. www.mardigrasworld.com. COST: $18. OPEN: Daily 9:30-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">National World War II Museum</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Exhibits take visitors from the Normandy invasion to the sands of Pacific Islands and the Home Front. The brainchild of historian and writer Dr. Stephen Ambrose, who taught for many years at the University of New Orleans until his death in 2002, this moving, well-executed examination of World War II covers far more ground than simply D-Day. The seminal moments are re-created through propaganda posters and radio clips from the period; biographical sketches of the military personnel involved; a number of short documentary films (including one bitterly sad film on the Holocaust, featuring interviews with survivors); and collections of weapons, personal items, and other artifacts from the war. The exhibits occupy a series of galleries spread through the interior of a huge warehouse space. One spotlighted exhibit, in a large, open portion of the warehouse near the entrance, is a replica of the Higgins boat troop landing craft, which were manufactured in New Orleans. In 2005 the museum announced a $300 million expansion plan to quadruple the size of the facility in several phases. Across the street from the current facility, a 4-D theater experience produced by Tom Hanks and a canteen featuring live period entertainment are set to open in November. This is the first of six new pavilions proposed for the expanded campus, due to be completed in 2015. Check the Web site for updates on the expansion and a list of current movies, lectures, events, and programs. www.nationalww2museum.org. COST: $14.

It is now a museum showcasing a spectacular collection of Mardi Gras memorabilia, and displays highlight both the little-known and popular traditions associated with New Orleans\'s most famous festival. The building\'s cupola, destroyed by a hurricane in 1915, was restored in 2005 to match the one atop its twin, the Cabildo. lsm.crt.state.la.us. COST: $5.

Treasures from all over the world and every era of human creativity comprise its expansive collection. It\'s easy to get dizzy circling all the Dutch master canvases, bronze Rodins, and ancient Greek artifacts—but if you need a breather, you can always retire to the Temple of Dendur or the rooftop café.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Times Square</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Times Square is the most frenetic part of New York City: a cacophony of flashing lights, honking horns, and shoulder-to-shoulder crowds that many New Yorkers studiously avoid. But if you like sensory overload, the chaotic mix of huge underwear billboards, flashing digital displays, on-location television broadcasts, and outré street performers it will give you your fix. If you\'re a quieter sort, it will almost certainly give you a headache.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Empire State Building</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the 86th-floor observatory, which towers 1,050 feet above the city, you can see up to 80 mi away on a clear day (and it\'s heated and air-conditioned, unlike the deck 16 stories farther up). The views at night are equally stunning, with the glittering city lights French architect Le Corbusier once called \"a Milky Way come down to earth.\" If you\'re afraid of heights, gazing at the building from afar will still deliver a dose of dazzle—especially after dark, when it\'s illuminated by colored lights that correspond to different holidays and events.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museum of Modern Art</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Described as a \"modernist dream world\" after its $425 million face-lift in 2004, MoMA has since become as famous for its architecture as for its collections. Yoshio Taniguchi, the Japanese architect responsible for the redesign, created newly spacious, soaring-ceiling galleries suffused with natural light, where masterpieces like Monet\'s <i>Water Lilies,</i> Picasso\'s <i>Les Demoiselles d\'Avignon,</i> and van Gogh\'s <i>Starry Night</i> can get the oohs and aahs they deserve. The museum\'s restaurant next door, the Modern, is nearly as breathtaking.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Brooklyn Bridge</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">\"A drive-through cathedral\" is how critic James Wolcott described this, one of New York\'s noblest and most recognized landmarks. Spanning the East River, the Brooklyn Bridge connects the island of Manhattan to the borough of Brooklyn (once an independent city, and still worth a visit in its own right). A leisurely hour\'s stroll on the pedestrian walkway (which you\'ll share with bicyclists and in-line skaters) is an essential New York experience. Traffic is beneath you, and the views along the East River and of Manhattan\'s Financial District are some of the best anywhere.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Statue of Liberty</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Presented to the United States in 1886 as a gift from France, Lady Liberty is a near-universal symbol of freedom and democracy, standing 152 feet high atop an 89-foot pedestal on Liberty Island. You can get a taste of the thrill millions of immigrants must have experienced as you approach Liberty Island on the ferry from Battery Park.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">American Museum of Natural History</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The towering, spectacularly reassembled dinosaur skeletons that greet you when you enter this museum are practically worth the (suggested) price of admission. But there\'s tons more, including exhibits of ancient civilizations, animals both stuffed and living (don\'t miss the live Butterfly Conservatory October-May), a hall of oceanic creatures overlooked by a 94-foot model of a blue whale, and space shows at the adjoining Rose Center for Earth and Space.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Central Park</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The literal and spiritual center of Manhattan, Central Park has 843 acres of meandering paths, tranquil lakes, ponds, and open meadows. For equestrians, softball and soccer players, strollers, ice- and roller skaters, rock climbers, bird-watchers, boaters, picnickers, and outdoor performers, it\'s an oasis of fresh air and greenery that lets them forget—at least for a little while—the hustle and congestion of the city.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bronx Zoo</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One urban jungle deserves another. Only at the world\'s largest urban zoo is there room for gorillas to lumber around a 6.5-acre simulated rain forest, or tigers and lions to roam nearly 40 acres of open meadows.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">SoHo</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The elegant cast-iron buildings, cobblestone streets, art galleries, chic boutiques, and swanky hotels make this a wonderful area in which to shop, drink, and dream of a more glamorous life.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">New York City Today</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">New York, New York. It\'s hard living here when the economy\'s up, and it\'s even harder when the economy is going down. New Yorkers are trying to make do with a new normal that includes a financial sector on the skids and a cooling real-estate market. So, please excuse us if we\'re gruff—or make that even gruffer than normal.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Those anxieties go all the way to the top: just like the rest of us, Mayor Michael Bloomberg is concerned about keeping his job. After shepherding the city through years of dizzying expansion after 9/11, Mayor Bloomberg campaigned in October of 2008 to extend the term limits for Mayor and city council, allowing him to run a third time. New Yorkers are divided on the possibility of a third term. While Bloomberg was undoubtedly popular when the money was rolling in, now that they view his last two terms with a critical eye, some see his push to run again as hubristic.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whoever is elected will face a new set of difficulties, including MTA Budget shortfalls and a shrinking tax base. Many of the city\'s linchpin industries, including finance, real estate, hospitality and the arts are going through periods of contraction. Difficulties in the finance sector in particular ripple through the city. When bonuses are small—or layoffs are plentiful—fewer apartments are purchased, people eat out less, and seats at Broadway shows go unfilled.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A big focus is also on the real estate here. In Manhattan rents have fallen from their 2007 peaks. Condo buildings conceived during the boom are coming to completion in a completely different market. The Williamsburg and Greenpoint waterfront in Brooklyn is full of half-empty or half-finished projects. Citywide, pioneering gentrifiers worry that their neighborhoods might not stay so nice during a downturn. Despite the doom and gloom, prices here still outstrip most U.S. cities: the average cost of an apartment citywide is $669,000, down 10 percent from a year ago. The price in Manhattan for a condo continues to climb, but sales volume is down a staggering 55 percent compared to the same time last year.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">No matter the economy, people still get hungry, so locals are still eating out...just not so much at places with $50 entrées. But price aside, there are exciting meals to be had. Heck, you can even have an eight-course meal with Tom Colicchio, Mr. Top Chef himself, at his restaurant Craft as part of his recent \"Tom Tuesday Dinner\" promotion. More cheaply, you can try to spot David Chang while slurping from a bowl of noodles at the Momofuku Noodle Bar or simply eat your weight in French fries at Pommes Frites. There\'s something for everyone to eat, and plenty of restaurants have promotions to lure diners on slower nights, so keep an eye out for those. Since strong cocktails are a necessity during these trying times, New York\'s bars have risen to the task by serving delicious, complex drinks at White Star, Death &amp; Co., and the Clover Club.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Meanwhile, in the world of the performing arts, long-running shows are closing, but things aren\'t totally dire. There are bargain tickets galore to the surviving plays and musicals, and Off-Broadway shows are ascendant in popularity and quality. Plus, we still have <i>Law &amp; Order</i> (filming just about everywhere in the city on any given day) as well as <i>Gossip Girl</i> and <i>30 Rock</i> at the Silvercup Studios in Queens. Musically, there\'s everything from indie troubadour Beirut at the Brooklyn Academy of Music to Billy Joel playing the last concert at Shea Stadium. And if those don\'t appeal, there are countless other venues from Red Hook to Morningside Heights.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">They say if you can make it here you can make it anywhere. In a New York that\'s in flux between identifying as a \"luxury city\" (as Mayor Bloomberg called it) and a becoming town with the same struggles as the rest of America,\"making it\" feels like an even bigger accomplishment. Luckily, New Yorkers are a proud bunch, and we\'re happy to share all the tips and tricks we\'ve learned. Welcome.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Empire State Building</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At night the Empire State Building illuminates the Manhattan skyline with a colorful view as awe-inspiring from a distance as the view from the top. The colors at the top of the building are changed regularly to reflect seasons, events, and holidays, so New Yorkers and visitors from around the world always have a reason to look at this icon in a new light.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The building\'s first light show was in November 1932, when a simple searchlight was used to spread the news that New York-born Franklin Delano Roosevelt had been elected president of the United States. Douglas Leigh, sign designer and mastermind of Times Square\'s kinetic billboard ads, tried to brighten up prospects at the \"Empty State Building\" after the Depression by negotiating with the Coca-Cola Company to occupy the top floors. He proposed that Coca-Cola could change the lights of the building to serve as a weather forecast and then publish a small guide on its bottles to decipher the colors. Coca-Cola loved this idea but the deal fell through due to Pearl Harbor, when the U.S. government needed office space in the building.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1956 the revolving \"freedom lights\" were installed to welcome people to America; then in 1964 the top 30 floors of the building were illuminated to mark the New York World\'s Fair. Douglas Leigh revisited the lights of the ESB in 1976 when he was made chairman of City Decor to welcome the Democratic Convention. He introduced the idea of color lighting, and so the building\'s tower was ablaze in red, white, and blue to welcome the convention and to mark the celebration of the American Bicentennial. The color lights were a huge success and they remained red, white, and blue for the rest of the year.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Leigh\'s next suggestion of tying the lights to different holidays, a variation on his weather theme for Coca-Cola, is the basic scheme still used today. In 1977 the lighting system was updated to comply with energy conservation programs and to allow for a wider range of colors. Leigh further improved this new system in 1984 by designing an automated color-changing system so vertical fluorescents in the mast could be changed with the flick of a switch, the only automated portion of the building\'s lighting system to date. With a schedule that changes each year, the lights honor national holidays, the multiethnic population of New York, special local and national events, and charitable causes. The city\'s greatest night-light dims respectfully, however, to allow for migrating birds that could otherwise be distracted.

Guggenheim Museum</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Frank Lloyd Wright\'s landmark museum building is visited as much for its famous architecture as it is for its superlative art. Opened in 1959, shortly after Wright\'s death, the Guggenheim is acclaimed as one of the greatest buildings of the 20th century. After a three-year restoration project completed at the end of October 2008, the Guggenheim building is once again a glorious vision. Eleven coats of paint were removed, exterior cracks were fixed, and supporting structures were reinforced. Inside, under a 92-foot-high glass dome, a seemingly endless ramp spirals down past changing exhibitions. The museum has strong holdings of Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso, and Robert Mapplethorpe.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Highlights</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Wright\'s design was criticized by some who believed that the distinctive building detracted from the art within, but the interior nautilus design allows artworks to be viewed from several different angles and distances. Be sure to notice not only what\'s in front of you but also what\'s across the spiral from you.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On permanent display, the museum\'s Thannhauser Collection is made up primarily of works by French impressionists and Postimpressionists Matisse, van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, and Cézanne. Perhaps more than any other 20th-century painter, Wassily Kandinsky, one of the first \"pure\" abstract artists, has been closely linked to the museum\'s history. Beginning with the acquisition of his masterpiece <i>Composition 8</i> (1923) in 1930, the collection has grown to encompass more than 150 works.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tips</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Gallery talks provide richer understanding of the masterpieces in front of you.

But the gleaming new stadium, built adjacent to the old site, brings young and old to see the Bronx Bombers from April to September and—most-likely—during the playoffs as well. www.yankees.com. Subway:B (weekdays only), D, or 4 to 161st St.-Yankee Stadium. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Brooklyn Bridge</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">\"A drive-through cathedral\" is how the critic James Wolcott describes one of New York\'s noblest and most recognized landmarks, which spans the East River and connects Manhattan to Brooklyn. A walk across the bridge\'s promenade—a boardwalk elevated above the roadway and shared by pedestrians, in-line skaters, and bicyclists—takes about 40 minutes from the heart of Brooklyn Heights to Manhattan\'s civic center. It\'s well worth traversing for the astounding views. The roadway is supported by a web of steel cables, hung from the towers and attached to block-long anchorages on either shore. Subway:4, 5, 6 to Brooklyn Bridge/City Hall; J, M, Z to Chambers St.; A, C to High St.-Brooklyn Bridge. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Empire State Building</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bittersweet though it is, this landmark is once again the city\'s tallest building. Its pencil-slim silhouette, recognizable virtually worldwide, is an art deco monument to progress, a symbol for New York City, and a star in some great romantic scenes, on- and off-screen. Its cinematic résumé—the building has appeared in more than 200 movies—means that it remains a fixture of popular imagination, and many visitors come to relive favorite movie scenes. You might just find yourself at the top of the building with <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i> look-alikes or even the building\'s own <i>King Kong</i> impersonator.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Built in 1931 at the peak of the skyscraper craze, this 103-story limestone giant opened after a mere 13 months of construction. The framework rose at an astonishing rate of 4½ stories per week, making the Empire State Building the fastest-rising skyscraper ever built. Many floors were left completely unfinished so tenants could have them custom designed.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Thanks to advance ticketing on the Internet, you can speed your way to the observatory on the 86th floor. If this is your first visit, rent a headset with an audio tour from Tony, a fictional but \"authentic\" native New Yorker, available in eight languages. The 86th-floor observatory (1,050 feet high) is outdoors and spans the building\'s circumference. This is the deck to go to, to truly see the city. Don\'t be shy about going outside into the wind (even in winter) or you\'ll miss half the experience. Bring quarters for the high-powered binoculars: on clear days you can see up to 80 mi. If it rains, you can view the city between the clouds and watch the rain travel sideways around the building from the shelter of the enclosed walkway. The advantage of paying the extra $15 to go to the indoor 102nd floor is that this observatory affords an easy and less-crowded circular walk-around from which to view the city. It also feels more removed and quieter. Express tickets can be purchased for front-of-the-line admission for an extra $45.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Time your visit for early or late in the day—morning is the least crowded time, and at night the city lights are dazzling. A good strategy is to go up just before dusk and witness nightfall.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although some parents blanch when they discover both how much it costs and how it lurches, the second-floor <b>NY SKYRIDE</b> is a favorite of the seven- and eight-year-old set.

A massive four-year renovation completed in October 1998 restored the 1913 landmark to its original splendor—and then some.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You can best admire Grand Central\'s exquisite Beaux-Arts architecture from its ornate south face on East 42nd Street, modeled after a Roman triumphal arch. Crowning the facade\'s Corinthian columns and 75-foot-high arched windows, a graceful clock keeps time for hurried commuters. In the central window stands an 1869 bronze statue of Cornelius Vanderbilt, who built the station to house his railroad empire. Step inside past the glimmering chandeliers of the waiting room to the majestic <b>main concourse,</b> 200 feet long, 120 feet wide, and 120 feet (roughly 12 stories) high, modeled after a Roman bath. Overhead, a celestial map of the twinkling fiber-optic constellations covers the robin\'s egg-blue ceiling. During rush hour you\'ll be swept into the tides and eddies of human traffic, which swirl around the central information kiosk, a popular meeting place. Experience the thrill, then escape up the sweeping staircases at either end, where balconies house three upscale restaurants. Any would make an enjoyable perch from which to survey the concourse, but for a real taste of the station\'s early years, head beyond the western staircase to the Campbell Apartment, a clubby cocktail lounge housed in the restored private offices and salon of 1920s tycoon John W. Campbell.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Despite its grandeur, Grand Central still functions primarily as a railroad station. Underground, more than 60 ingeniously integrated railroad tracks lead trains upstate and to Connecticut via Metro-North Commuter Rail. The subway connects here as well. The <b>Municipal Art Society</b> (457 Madison Ave., between 50th and 51st Sts.tel. 212/935-3960. www.mas.org) leads architectural tours of the terminal that begin here on Wednesday at 12:30. Reservations are required and a $10 donation is suggested. www.grandcentralterminal.com.

For two watery reasons: the Seine and the sea. Just downstream from Vernon, where the Epte joins the Seine, Richard the Lion-Hearted\'s ruined castle at Les Andelys, immortalized by Paul Signac and Félix Vallotton, heralds the soft-lighted, cliff-lined Seine Valley, impressionistically evoked by Albert Lebourg and Gustave Loiseau in the Arts Museum in Rouen—where Camille Corot once studied, and whose mighty cathedral Monet painted until he was pink, purple, and blue in the face.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Seine joins the sea at Le Havre, where Monet grew up, a protégé of Eugène Boudin, often termed the precursor of Impressionism. Boudin would boat across the estuary from Honfleur, where he hobnobbed with Gustave Courbet, Charles Daubigny, and Alfred Sisley at the Ferme St-Siméon. Le Havre in the 1860s was base camp for Monet and his pals Frédéric Bazille and Johan Barthold Jongkind to explore the rugged coast up to Dieppe, with easels opened en route beneath the cliffs of Étretat.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The railroad from Gare St-Lazare (smokily evoked by Monet) put Dieppe within easy reach of Paris. Eugène Delacroix daubed seascapes here in 1852. Auguste Renoir visited Dieppe from 1878 to 1885; Paul Gauguin and Edgar Degas clinked glasses here in 1885; Camille Pissarro painted his way from Gisors to Dieppe in the 1890s.

The tapestry was probably commissioned from Saxon embroiderers by the count of Kent—who was also the bishop of Bayeux—to be displayed in his newly built cathedral, the Cathédrale Notre-Dame. Despite its age, the tapestry is in remarkably good condition; the extremely detailed, often homey scenes provide an unequaled record of the clothes, weapons, ships, and lifestyles of the day. It\'s showcased in the <b>Musée de la Tapisserie</b> (Tapestry Museum; free headphones let you to listen to an English commentary about the tapestry). www.tapisserie-bayeux.fr.

A connoisseur\'s favorite, it was begun by master architect François Mansart in 1626 and took a decade to complete. The <i>cour d\'honneur</i> is marked by two stylish side pavilions—an architectural grace note adapted from Italian Renaissance models—which beautifully frame the small, but very seignorial, central mass of the house. Inside, the <i>salon d\'honneur</i> is the very picture of Louis XIV decoration, while other rooms were recast in chic 19th-century style by Malcolm Forbes, who bought the château in 1970. A gallery houses the fascinating <b>Musée des Ballons</b> (Balloon Museum). The companion village to the château was designed by Mansart in one of the first examples of town planning in France. Note that the château itself is closed mid-October to mid-March, but the museum remains open. www.chateau-balleroy.com. COST: EUR 8.

The abbey was begun in Romanesque style in 1066 and expanded in the 18th century; its elegant buildings are now part of City Hall and some rooms are brightened by the city\'s fine collection of paintings. Note the magnificent yet spare façade of the abbey church of <b>St-Étienne,</b> enhanced by two 11th-century towers topped by octagonal spires. Inside, what had been William the Conqueror\'s tomb was destroyed by 16th-century Huguenots during the Wars of Religion. However, the choir still stands; it was the first to be built in Norman Gothic style, and many subsequent choirs were modeled after it. COST: Tours EUR 2.20.

The 550 acres of Muir Woods National Monument contain some of the most majestic redwoods in the world—some nearly 250 feet tall and 1,000 years old. The stand was saved from destruction in 1905, when it was purchased by a couple who donated it to the federal government. Three years later it was named after naturalist John Muir, whose environmental campaigns helped to establish the national park system. His response: \"This is the best tree lover\'s monument that could be found in all of the forests of the world. Saving these woods from the ax and saw is in many ways the most notable service to God and man I have heard of since my forest wandering began.\"</div><br><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Muir Woods, part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, is a pedestrian\'s park. The trails vary in difficulty and distance. Beginning from the park headquarters, a 2-mi, wheelchair-accessible <b>loop trail</b> crosses streams and passes ferns and azaleas, as well as magnificent redwood groves. Among the most famous are <b>Bohemian Grove</b> and the circular formation called <b>Cathedral Grove.</b> On summer weekends visitors oohing and aahing in a dozen languages line the trail. If you prefer a little more serenity, consider the challenging <b>Dipsea Trail,</b> which climbs west from the forest floor to soothing views of the ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge.

After a considerable amount of work, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was able to resurrect a 12-mi driving tour that follows various dikes. The habitat has been reclaimed, and the refuge once again hosts seasonal influxes of ducks, geese, pelicans, swans, and shore birds. The 31,000-square-foot James V.

The Osaka-Nara region was the center of the emerging Japanese (Yamato) nation into the ninth century, and in 645 Emperor Kotoku (596-654) made Osaka his capital. He called it Naniwa, but the city\'s imperial ascendancy was brief. Until the 8th century capital cities were relocated upon an emperor\'s death. As a result, Osaka was the royal seat for a fleeting nine years. Despite changes in its political fortunes, Osaka developed as a trade center, a role its waterways had destined it to play. Exchange wasn\'t limited to commerce. Buddhism and Chinese characters filtered into the fledgling Japanese society through Osaka to Nara, and from Nara to the rest of the country. By 1590 Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536-98), the first <i>daimyo</i> (warlord) to unite Japan, had completed construction of Osaka Castle to protect his realm against the unruly clans of Kyoto. He designated Osaka a merchant city to consolidate his position. After Toyotomi died, Tokugawa Ieyasu\'s (1543-1616) forces defeated the Toyotomi legacy at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Osaka\'s strategic importance was again short-lived, as Tokugawa moved the capital to Edo (now Tokyo) in 1603. Osaka grew rich supplying the new capital with rice, soy sauce, and sake as Edo transformed its agricultural land into city suburbs. All copper produced in Japan was exported through Osaka, and the National Rice Exchange was headquartered in Dojima, near Kita-shinchi. \"70% of the nation\'s wealth comes from Osaka,\" was the catchphrase of the era. Some of Japan\'s business dynasties were founded during the economic boom of the 17th century, and they prevail today—Sumitomo, Konoike, and Mitsui among them. By the end of the Genroku Era (1688-1704) Osaka\'s barons were patronizing <i>bunraku</i> puppetry and <i>kamigata kabuki</i> (comic kabuki). Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653-1724), writer of the <i>The Forty-Seven Ronin,</i> penned the tragedies which quickly became classics. Ihara Saikaku (1642-93) immortalized the city\'s merchants in the risqué <i>Life of an Amorous Man</i> and the <i>The Great Mirror of Male Love.</i> When Tokyo became the official capital of Japan in 1868 there were fears that the \"Venice of the East\" would suffer. But expansion of the spinning and textile industries assured prosperity, and earned Osaka a new epithet-\"<i>Manchester</i> of the East.\" As a consequence of the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923, Osaka became Japan\'s main port and by 1926 the country\'s largest city. Chemical and heavy industries grew during World War I, and were prime targets for American bombers during World War II. Much of Osaka was flattened, and more than a third of the prefecture\'s 4.8 million people were left homeless. During the postwar years many Osaka companies moved their headquarters to Tokyo. Even so, Osaka was rebuilt and went on to host Asia\'s first World Expo in 1970. It has since fashioned itself as a city of cutting-edge techonology and lifestyle. The Osaka City Government plans to revive the \"Water City\" appellation for Osaka, but for now the heritage of the city\'s waterways lives on in its place names: <i>bashi</i> (bridge), <i>horie</i> (canal), and <i>semba</i> (dockyard).</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">On the Menu</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Osakans are passionate about food. As the old saying goes, <i>Osaka wa kuida-ore</i>—in Osaka you eat so much you fall over. They expect restaurants to use the freshest ingredients—for centuries the nearby Seto Inland Sea has allowed all classes easy access to fresh seafood. Osakans continue to have discriminating palates and demand their money\'s worth.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Osakan cuisine is flavored with a soy sauce lighter in color and milder in flavor than the soy used in Tokyo. One local delicacy is <i>okonomiyaki,</i> something between a pancake and an omelet, filled with cabbage, mountain yams, pork, shrimp, and other ingredients. <i>Osaka-zushi</i> (Osaka-style sushi), made in wooden molds, has a distinctive square shape. <i>Unagi</i> (eel) remains a popular local dish; grilled unagi is eaten in summer for quick energy. <i>Fugu</i> (blowfish) served boiled or raw is a winter delicacy.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The thick white noodles known as <i>udon</i> are a Japanese staple, but Osakans are particularly fond of <i>kitsune</i> udon, a local dish (now popular throughout Japan) in which the noodles are served with fried tofu known as <i>abura-age.</i> Another Osaka invention is <i>takoyaki,</i> griddle dumplings with octopus, green onions, and ginger smothered in a delicious sauce.

Originally built in the 1580s, today the five-story ferro-concrete reconstruction (completed in 1931) presides over the wide Osaka Koen, which encloses the castle moat. Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the first warlord to unite Japan, was showing off with this castle. It was intended to intimidate his rivals and show his commitment to Osaka and attract merchants from all over Japan.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Inside the castle there is a museum with artifacts of the Toyotomi family and historical objects relating to Osaka prior to the Tokugawa shogunate. Unless you are a Hideyoshi aficionado, these exhibits are of limited interest; the castle\'s magnificent exterior and the impressive view from the eighth floor of the donjon are the reasons to see Osaka-jo. If your timing is right, you might catch the cherry blossoms (late March-early April) and <b>Nishi-no-maru Teien</b> (Nishi-no-maru Garden) at their best.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From Osaka-jo Koen-mae Station it\'s about a 10-minute walk up the hill to the castle. You can also take the Tani-machi subway line from Higashi-Umeda Station (just southeast of Osaka Station) to Tani-machi 4-chome Station. From here it\'s a 15-minute walk.

Or you can take the Sognsvann trikk to the end of the line and walk or jog along Sognsvann Lake.

You can also spend a sunny summer afternoon at Oslo\'s harbor, Aker Brygge, admiring the docked boats; or venture out into the fjords on a charter or tour.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Oslo fjord and its islands, the forested woodlands called the <i>marka,</i> (or Oslomarka) make the Norwegian capital an irresistible place for outdoor activities like swimming in lakes or hiking. Nine alpine ski areas have activities until late at night. More than 2,600 km (1,600 mi) of prepared cross-country ski trails run deep into the forest, of which 90 km (50 mi) are lighted for special evening tours.

The museum is a monument to his artistic genius, housing the largest collection of his works and changing exhibitions. Munch actually painted several different versions of <i>The Scream,</i> the image for which he\'s best known. An important one of his Scream paintings, as well as another painting, <i>The Madonna,</i> were stolen from the Munch Museum in an armed robbery in 2004 but were fortunately recovered in 2006, and put back on display in 2008 after extensive restoration work.

From the stoic stave church to farmers\' houses made of sod, the old buildings here span Norway\'s regions and history as far back as the 14th century. Indoors, there\'s a fascinating display of folk costumes. The displays of richly embroidered, colorful <i>bunader</i> (national costumes) from every region includes one set at a Telemark country wedding. The museum also has stunning dragon-style wood carvings from 1550 and some beautiful <i>rosemaling,</i> or decorative painted floral patterns. The traditional costumes of the Sami (Lapp) people of northern Norway are exhibited around one of their tents.

Discovered in Viking tombs around the Oslo fjords between 1860 and 1904, the boats are the best-preserved Viking ships ever found and have been exhibited since the museum\'s 1957 opening. In Viking times, it was customary to bury the dead with food, drink, useful and decorative objects, and even their horses and dogs. Many of the well-preserved tapestries, household utensils, dragon-style wood carvings, and sledges were found aboard ships. The museum\'s rounded white walls give the feeling of a burial mound.

High summer is lovely, but droves of visitors have the same effect on some travelers as bad weather. If crowds trouble you, but you relish a bit of sunshine, consider visiting in late spring or early fall, when the weather is not too bad, and the crowds have headed home for the school year. Book tickets and accommodations well in advance for Henley\'s Royal Regatta at the cusp of June and July or Ascot\'s Royal Meeting in mid-June. Visiting at Eton and the Oxford colleges is much more restricted during term time (generally September to late March and late April to mid-July).

Built by Sir John Vanbrugh in the early 1700s, Blenheim was given by Queen Anne and the nation to General John Churchill, first duke of Marlborough, in gratitude for his military victories against the French in 1704. The exterior is mind-boggling, with its huge columns, enormous pediments, and obelisks, all exemplars of English baroque. Inside, lavishness continues in monumental extremes. In most of the opulent rooms great family portraits look down at sumptuous furniture, elaborate carpets, and immense pieces of silver. Exquisite tapestries in the three state rooms illustrate the first duke\'s victories. For some visitors, however, the most memorable room is the small, low-ceiling chamber where Winston Churchill (his father was the younger brother of the then-duke) was born in 1874; he is buried in nearby Bladon.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sir Winston wrote that the unique beauty of Blenheim lay in its perfect adaptation of English parkland to an Italian palace. Indeed the 2,000 acres of grounds, the work of Capability Brown, 18th-century England\'s most gifted landscape gardener, are arguably the best example of the \"cunningly natural\" park in the country. It\'s well worth a stroll. Tucked away here is the Temple of Diana, where Winston Churchill proposed to his future wife, Clementine. Blenheim\'s formal gardens include notable water terraces and an Italian garden with a mermaid fountain, all built in the 1920s.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Pleasure Gardens, reached by a train that stops outside the main entrance to the palace, contain some child-pleasers: a butterfly house, notable 1-acre hedge maze, playground, and giant chess set. The herb-and-lavender garden is also delightful. In summer a miniature train runs every 30 minutes from 11 until 5, connecting the palace with the pleasure gardens. It\'s easy to spend half a day here. www.blenheimpalace.com. COST: Palace, park, and gardens: mid-Feb. and Apr.-Oct. £17.50; late Feb., Mar., and Nov.-mid-Dec. £14.50.

G. H. Destailleur built the house in the 1880s for Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild in the style of a French chateau, with perfectly balanced turrets and towers and walls of creamy stone. Although intended only for summer weekend house parties, it was lovingly furnished over the course of 35 years with Savonnerie carpets, Sèvres porcelain, furniture made by Riesener for Marie Antoinette, and paintings by Guardi, Dutch and Flemish masters, Gainsborough, and Reynolds. An exquisite 21st-century broken porcelain chandelier by Ingo Maurer in the Blue Dining Room brings the collection up to date. The gardens are equally extraordinary, with an aviary, colorful plantings, and winding trails that provide panoramic views. In the restaurant you can dine on English or French fare and order excellent Rothschild wines if your pocketbook can take the hit. Admission prices are a bit higher on weekends.

They come in all sizes, from pinkie-size bites to holiday cannoli the size of a coffee table. Even your everyday bar will display a window piled high with dozens of varieties of ricotta-based desserts, including delicious fried balls of dough. The traditional cake of Sicily is the <i>cassata siciliana,</i> a rich chilled sponge cake with sheep\'s-milk ricotta and candied fruit. Often brightly colored, it\'s the most popular dessert at many Sicilian restaurants, and you shouldn\'t miss it. From behind bakery windows and glass cases beam tiny marzipan sweets fashioned into brightly colored apples, cherries, and even hamburgers and prosciutto.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If it\'s summer, do as the locals do and dip your morning brioche—the best in Italy—into a cup of brilliantly refreshing coffee or almond granita. The world\'s first ice cream is said to have been made by the Romans from the snow on the slopes of Mount Etna, and the practice of producing top-quality gelato, and eating it in great quantities, is still prevalent throughout the island.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.  All rights reserved.</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1537,'<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mount Etna</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mount Etna is one of the world\'s major active volcanoes and is the largest and highest in Europe—the cone of the crater rises to 10,902 feet above sea level. Plato sailed in just to catch a glimpse in 387 BC; in the 9th century AD, the oldest gelato of all was shaved off its snowy slopes; and in the 21st century the volcano still claims annual headlines. Etna has erupted a dozen times in the past 30 or so years, most spectacularly in 1971, 1983, 2001, 2002, and 2005; there were a pair of medium-size eruptions in 2008. Travel in the proximity of the crater depends on Mount Etna\'s temperament, but you can walk up and down the enormous lava dunes and wander over its moonlike surface of dead craters. The rings of vegetation change markedly as you rise, with vineyards and pine trees gradually giving way to growths of broom and lichen. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Valle dei Templi</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whether you first come upon the Valle dei Templi (Valley of the Temples) in the early morning light, bathed by golden floodlights at night, or at their very best in February, when the valley is awash in the fragrant blossoms of thousands of olive trees, it\'s easy to see why Akragas was celebrated by the Greek poet Pindar as \"the most beautiful city built by mortal men.\" One ticket covers all temples, and none of the plaques is particularly helpful.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though getting to, from, and around the dusty ruins of the Valle dei Templi is no great hassle, this important archaeological zone deserves several hours. The site, which opens at 8:30 AM, is divided into western and eastern sections. For instant aesthetic gratification, walk through the eastern zone; for a more comprehensive tour, start way out at the western end and work your way back uphill.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The temples are a bit spread out, but the valley is all completely walkable and generally toured on foot. However, note that there is only one hotel (Villa Athena) that is close enough to walk to the ruins, so you will most likely have to drive to reach the site; parking is at the entrance to the temple area.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The eight pillars of the <b>Tempio di Ercole</b> (Temple of Hercules) make up Agrigento\'s oldest temple complex, dating from the 6th century BC. Partially reconstructed in 1922, it reveals the remains of a large Doric temple that originally had 38 columns. Like all the area temples, it faces east. The Museo Archeologico Nazionale contains some of the marble warrior figures that once decorated its pediment.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The beautiful <b>Tempio della Concordia</b> (Temple of Concord), up the hill from the Temple of Hercules, is perhaps <i>the</i> best-preserved Greek temple in existence. The structure dates from about 430 BC, and owes its exceptional state of preservation to the fact that it was converted into a Christian church in the 6th century and was extensively restored in the 18th. Thirty-two Doric columns surround its large interior, and everything but the roof and treasury are still standing. For preservation, this temple is blocked off to the public, but you can still get close enough to appreciate how well it\'s withstood the past 2,400 years.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Tempio di Giunone</b> (Temple of Juno), east on the Via Sacra from the Temple of Concord, commands an exquisite view of the valley, especially at sunset. It\'s similar to but smaller than the Concordia and dates from about 450 BC. Traces of a fire that probably occurred during the Carthaginian attack in 406 BC, which destroyed the ancient town, can be seen on the walls of the cellar. Thirty of the original 34 columns still stand, of which 16 still retain their capitals.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though never completed, the <b>Tempio di Giove</b> (Temple of Jupiter) was considered the eighth wonder of the world. The temple was probably built in gratitude for victory over Carthage and was constructed by prisoners captured in that war. Basically Doric in style, it did not have the usual colonnade of freestanding columns but rather a series of half columns attached to a solid wall. Inside the excavation you can see a cast (not the original) of one of the 38 colossal Atlas-like figures, or telamones, that supported the temple\'s massive roof. This design is unique among known Doric temples, and with a length of more than 330 feet the building was once the biggest of the Akragas temples and one of the largest temples in the Greek world.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Tempio di Castore e Polluce</b> (Temple of Castor and Pollux) is a troublesome reconstruction of a 5th-century BC temple. It was pieced together by some enthusiastic if misguided 19th-century romantics, who, in 1836, haphazardly put together elements from diverse buildings. Ironically, the four gently crumbling columns supporting part of an entablature of the temple have become emblematic of Agrigento.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Right opposite the Temple of Castor and Pollox, facing north, the <b>Santuario delle Divinità Ctonie</b> (Sanctuary of the Chthonic Divinities) has cultic altars and eight small temples dedicated to Demeter, Persephone, and other Underworld deities. In the vicinity are two columns of a temple dedicated to Hephaestus (Vulcan).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the left of the Temple of Concord is a Paleochristian <b>necropolis.</b> Early Christian tombs were both cut into the rock and dug into underground catacombs. At the end of Via dei Templi, where it turns left and becomes Via Petrarca, stands the <b>Museo Archeologico Nazionale</b> (Contrada San Nicola. tel. 0922/401565. COST: EUR 6, EUR 10 including temples. OPEN: Tues.-Sat. 9-7, Sun. and Mon. 9-1) An impressive collection of antiquities from the site includes vases, votives, everyday objects, weapons, statues, and models of the temples. Visit the museum after you\'ve seen the temples. The <b>Hellenistic and Roman Quarter,</b> across the road from the archaeological museum, consists of four parallel streets, running north-south, that have been uncovered, along with the foundations of some houses from the Roman settlement (2nd century BC). Some of these streets still have their original mosaic pavements. www.valledeitempli.net. COST: SiteEUR 6, with museumEUR 10 including museum. One ticket covers all temples. OPEN: Daily 8:30-7; Nov.-Mar., western section closes at 5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Duomo</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Siracusa\'s Duomo is an archive of island history: the bottommost excavations have unearthed remnants of Sicily\'s distant past, when the Siculi inhabitants worshipped their deities here. During the 5th century BC (the same time as Agrigento\'s Temple of Concord was built), the Greeks built a temple to Athena over it, and in the 7th century Siracusa\'s first Christian cathedral was built on top of the Greek structure. The massive columns of the original Greek temple were incorporated into the present structure and are clearly visible, embedded in the exterior wall along Via Minerva. The Greek columns were also used to dramatic advantage inside, where on one side they form chapels connected by elegant wrought-iron gates. The baroque facade, added in 1700, displays a harmonious rhythm of concaves and convexes. In front, the piazza is encircled by pink and white oleanders and elegant buildings ornamented with filigree grillwork.

See-through houses with glass exterior walls are common. Oversize flat roofs provide shade from the sun, and many buildings\' sculptural forms reflect nearby landforms. The style is notable for elegant informality, clean lines, and simple landscaping. Emblematic structures in Palm Springs include public buildings, hotels, stores, banks, and private residences.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most obvious to visitors are three buildings that are part of the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway complex, built in the 1960s. Albert Frey, a Swiss-born architect, designed the soaring A-frame Tramway Gas Station, visually echoing the pointed peaks behind it. Frey also created the glass-walled Valley Station, from which you get your initial view of the Coachella Valley before you board the tram to the Mountain Station, designed by E. Stewart Williams.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Frey, a Palm Springs resident for more than 60 years, also designed the indoor-outdoor City Hall, Fire Station #1, and numerous houses. You can see his second home, perched atop stilts on the hillside above the Desert Museum; it affords a sweeping view of the Coachella Valley through glass walls. The classy Movie Colony Hotel, one of the first buildings Frey designed in the desert, may seem like a typical 1950s motel with rooms surrounding a swimming pool now, but when it was built in 1935, it was years ahead of its time.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Donald Wexler, who honed his vision with Los Angeles architect Richard Neutra, brought new ideas about the use of materials to the desert, where he teamed up with William Cody on a number of projects, including the terminal at the Palm Springs airport. Many of Wexler\'s buildings have soaring overhanging roofs, designed to provide shade under the blazing desert sun. Wexler also experimented with steel framing back in 1961, but the metal proved too expensive. Seven of his steel-frame houses can be seen in a neighborhood off Indian Canyon and Frances drives.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Palm Springs Modern Committee is protecting these period structures, occasionally protesting projected demolition projects. The committee also publishes a map and driving guide to 52 historic buildings, which is available for $5 at either of the Palm Springs Visitor Information Centers or at www.psmodcom.com.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Taking part in some of Paris\'s quintessential experiences will allow you to learn more about French culture, and you\'ll get to meet and mingle with locals and like-minded travelers, creating a far more enriching trip to Paris, whether it\'s your first or fortieth visit! Below are some experiences that we recommend.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Food</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nothing is more French than fine wine and gourmet cuisine. So why not enjoy them hands-on, with cooking classes to perfect your <i>magret de canard</i> (duck breast) or to master the art of the soufflé. There are many options, from full-day courses in a Parisian home (in English) that include a market tour, to quick lunch lessons with the locals where everyone dines together afterward. In English except as noted: <b>Paule Caillat\'s Promenades Gourmandes</b> (<i>01-48-04-56-84</i>www.promenadesgourmandes.com). <b>Food Unites the World</b> (<i>01-45-00-08-31</i>www.foodunitestheworld.com). <b>Marguerite\'s Elegant Home Cooking</b> (<i>01-42-04-74-00</i>www.elegantcooking.com).<b> Les Coulisses du Chef</b> (<i>01-40-26-14-00</i>www.coursdecuisineparis.com). <b>Atéliers des Chefs</b> (www.atelierdeschefs.com), group classes in French.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wine</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">And it\'s no secret that appreciating your wine is greatly enhanced when you know what you\'re drinking and where it came from. Wine-tasting classes range from fun and casual lessons in English for absolute beginners to more formal dégustations of the finest vintages by seasoned sommeliers. There\'s something to fit all budgets and experience levels. <b>O-Château</b> (<i>01-44-73-97-80</i> or <i>0-800-801-148</i>toll-free in France www.o-chateau.com) does wine-tasting lessons in English, vineyard tours, and Champagne cruises on the Seine. <b>Legrand Filles &amp; Fils</b> (<i>01-42-60-07-12-12</i>www.caves-legrand.com) conducts Tuesday night Soirées Dégustation with a bilingual presentation of carefully chosen wines. <b>Wine Dinners</b> (<i>01-41-83-80-46</i>www.wine-dinners.com) is a French group hosted by bilingual François Audouze; it organizes gourmet meals (in Michelin-starred restaurants) with a selection of 10 wines.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">21st-century Salons</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Parisian salons—where a select group of connoisseurs gathered in a private home to discuss the artistic, literary, political, and philosophical ideas of the time—flourished in past centuries. They\'re back, in English, and open to anyone who calls to reserve a place. It\'s an experience not to be missed, and a great way to meet interesting people. <b>Jim Haynes</b> (<i>01-43-27-17-67</i>) hosts an international crowd for Sunday night dinner: informal \"standing room only\" affairs in his converted artist atelier. <b>Patricia Laplante-Collins</b> (<i>01-43-26-12-88</i>www.parissoirees.com/aboutsoirees.html) has guest speakers at her twice-weekly dinners on the Ile St-Louis, including writers, artists, chefs, or other personalities. <b>Dinnertime = Talktime</b> (<i>01-43-25-86-55</i>language.meetup.com/59/) is a weekly language gathering hosted in a Quartier Latin home by Michael and Veronique.

This collection is a fascinating hodgepodge of Parisian artifacts and art, from the prehistoric canoes used by Parisii tribes to the furniture of the cork-lined bedroom where Marcel Proust labored over his evocative novels. You can get a great feel for the evolvement of the city through the ages thanks to scores of paintings. The museum fills two adjacent mansions, the Hôtel Le Peletier de St-Fargeau and the Hôtel Carnavalet. The latter is a Renaissance jewel that in the mid-1600s became the home of writer Madame de Sévigné. The long-lived Sévigné wrote hundreds of frank and funny letters to her daughter, giving an incomparable view of both public and private life during the time of Louis XIV. The museum offers a glimpse into her world, but the collection covers far more than just the 17th century. The exhibits on the Revolution are especially interesting, with scale models of guillotines, a replica of the Bastille prison carved from one of its stones, even a cast-iron stove in the shape of the Bastille. There is an amazing assortment of reconstructed interiors from the Middle Ages through the rococo period and into Art Nouveau—showstoppers include the Fouquet jewelry shop and the Café de Paris\'s original furnishings. There is some information in English. www.carnavalet.paris.fr. COST: Free for permanent collection, EUR 6 for exhibits. OPEN: Tues.-Sun. 10-5:40. Metro: St-Paul. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hôtel des Invalides</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Les Invalides (pronounced <i>lehz-ahn-vah-leed</i>), as this Baroque complex is known, is the eternal home of Napoléon Bonaparte (1769-1821), or more specifically, the little dictator\'s tomb, which lies under the towering golden dome. There are two churches here: <b>St-Louis des Invalides Church,</b> built between 1677 and 1706, later subdivided into the <b>Eglise du Dome</b> and the <b>Eglise des Soldats</b> (Soldiers\' Church).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Louis XIV ordered this complex built in 1670 to house-disabled soldiers, and at one time 4,000 military men lived here. Today, a portion of it remains a veterans\' residence and hospital. There\'s also the <b>Musée de l\'Armée,</b> an exhaustive collection of military artifacts from antique armor to weapons. The World Wars Department, also housed here, chronicles the great wars that ravaged Europe.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you see only one sight here, make it the <b>Eglise du Dome</b> at the back of the complex. Napoléon\'s tomb was moved here in 1840 from the island of Saint Helena, where the emperor died in forced exile. Napoléon\'s body is protected by a series of no fewer than six coffins, one inside the next (sort of like a Russian nesting doll), which is then encased in a sarcophagus of red quartzite. The bombastic tribute is ringed by statues symbolizing Napoléon\'s campaigns of conquest. Also on display are the emperor\'s trademark gray frock coat and huge bicorne hat. Look for the collection of figurines reenacting the famous coronation scene when Napoléon crowns his empress, Josephine. (Notice the heavily rouged cheeks; Napoléon hated pale skin.) You can see a grander version of this scene hanging in the Louvre by the painter David.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, in 1989, the dome was regilded using more than half a million gold leaves, or more than 20 pounds of gold. Renovations of the church and the museum are ongoing, so parts of it may be closed. The <b>Esplanade des Invalides,</b> the great lawns in front of the building, are favorite spots for pickup soccer and Frisbee games, sunbathing, and dog walking—despite signs asking you to stay off the grass. The best entrance to use is at the southern end, on Place Vauban (Avenue de Tourville). The ticket office is here, as is Napoléon\'s Tomb. There are automatic ticket machines at the main entrance on the Place des Invalides. www.invalides.org. COST: EUR 8. OPEN: Eglise du Dôme and museums Apr.-Sept., daily 10-6; Oct.-Mar., daily 10-5. Closed 1st Mon. of every month. Metro: La Tour-Maubourg/Invalides. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Louvre</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most recognized symbol of Paris is the Tour Eiffel, but the ultimate traveler\'s prize is the Louvre. This is the world\'s greatest art museum—and the largest, with representative examples from almost every civilization on earth. The three most popular pieces of art here are, of course, the Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo, and Winged Victory. Beyond these must-sees, your best bet is to focus on highlights that interest you personally—and don\'t despair if you get lost, for you\'re bound to stumble into something fascinating. When you arrive, pick up a copy of the museum\'s excellent color-coded map to get your bearings.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Louvre is much more than a museum—it is a saga that started centuries ago, as a fortress at the turn of the 13th century, and later a royal residence. It was not until the 16th century, under François I, that today\'s Louvre began to take shape, and through the years Henry IV, Louis XIII, Louis XV, Napoléon I, and Napoléon III all contributed to its construction. Napoléon Bonaparte\'s military campaigns at the turn of the 19th century brought a new influx of holdings, as his soldiers carried off treasures from each invaded country. During World War II some of the most precious artworks were hidden, while the remainder was looted. Most of the stolen pieces were recovered after the liberation of Paris, but no large-scale changes were made until François Mitterrand was elected President in 1981, when he kicked off the Grand Louvre project to expand and modernize the museum.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mitterrand commissioned I. M. Pei\'s Pyramide, the giant glass pyramid surrounded by three smaller pyramids that opened in 1989 over the new entrance in the Cour Napoléon. The Louvre is comprised of three wings—the Richelieu, the Sully, and the Denon—arranged like a horseshoe, with the <i>Pyramide</i> nestled outside in the middle. Entering from the <i>Pyramide</i>, head upstairs to the sculpture courtyards in the Richelieu Wing, where you\'ll find the <b>Marly Horses</b>, four horse sculptures—two carved for Louis XIV, and two for Louis XV—in Cour Marly. The ground floor and underground rooms in this wing contain French sculpture, 18th-century French art, and the Near East Antiquities Collection, including the <b>Lamassu</b>, carved 8th-century winged beasts. On the first floor of this wing you\'ll find the <b>Royal Apartments of Napoleon III</b>, a dozen elaborately decorated reception rooms. Continue to the second floor to marvel at the French and Northern School paintings, including Vermeer\'s <b><i>The Lacemaker,</i></b> a small but famous work. If you need a bite to eat, check out Café Richelieu on the first floor, or Café Marly, accessible only from outside—both spots offer good views of the <i>Pyramide</i>.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The entrance to the Sully Wing is the most impressive—you get to walk around the 13th century foundations and the site\'s original <b>Medievel Moat</b> (no longer filled with water). Below ground you\'ll find the largest display of Egyptian antiques in the world after the Cairo museum, featuring such artifacts as <b>Ramses II</b>, a beautifully proportionate statue from the site of Tanis. Upstairs in Salle 12 is the famous 2nd-century <b>Venus de Milo</b>, a beautiful armless statue that\'s one of the most recognizable works of art in the world. The first and second floors of the Sully Wing boast decorative arts from all over Europe, as well as 17th-century French paintings, including the <b>Turkish Bath</b> by Jean-August-Dominique Ingres.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the south and east of the <i>Pyramide</i> entrance are galleries displaying early Renaissance sculpture in the Denon Wing. Don\'t skip the coat check on the ground floor tucked behind the stairs—much of the museum is hot and stuffy. Walk up the marble Escalier Daru to discover the sublime <b>Winged Victory of Samothrace</b>, a statue found on a tiny Greek island that was carved in 305 BC to commemorate the naval victory of Demetrius Poliocretes over the Turks. In the Paintings section of the Denon Wing, you\'ll find four by Leonardo da Vinci, including the most famous painting in the world: the <b>Mona Lisa</b>, located in Salle 7. Head across to Salle 75 for the <b>Coronation of Napoléon</b>, or to Salle 77 for the gruesome 1819 <b>The Raft of the Medusa</b>.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The underground entrance to each wing has audio rentals; for EUR 5 you get information about the entire museum. Thematic leaflets (including some for kids) and Louvre guided tours are available from the front desk. To save time, head for the entrance in the underground mall, Carrousel du Louvre, which has automatic ticket machines, or book your tickets online and have them mailed to you before you even leave home. Be sure to hold on to your ticket; you can come and go as often as you like during the day. The shortest lines tend to be around 1 PM. Prices drop after 6 PM for the late-night Wednesday and Friday openings; crowds thin out in the evenings. Remember that the Louvre is closed on Tuesday! www.louvre.fr. COST: EUR 9, EUR 6 after 6. OPEN: Mon., Thurs., and weekends 9-6, Wed. and Fri. 9. Metro: Palais-Royal/Musée du Louvre. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Tour Eiffel</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If the Statue of Liberty is emblematic of New York, Big Ben is London, and the Kremlin is Moscow, then the Eiffel Tower is the symbol of Paris. French engineer Gustave Eiffel—already famous for building viaducts and bridges—spent two years working to erect this monument, for the World Exhibition of 1889.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Because its colossal bulk exudes a feeling of mighty permanence, you may have trouble believing that it nearly became 7,000 tons (the 1,063-foot tower contains 12,000 pieces of metal and 2,500,000 rivets of scrap iron when its concession expired in 1909. At first many Parisians hated the structure, agreeing with designer William Morris, who, explaining why he had been spending so much time at the Tour said \"Why on earth have I come here? Because it\'s the only place I can\'t see it from.\" Only its potential use as a radio antenna saved the day (it still bristles with a forest of radio and television transmitters). Gradually, though, the Tour Eiffel became part of the Parisian landscape, entering the hearts and souls of Parisians and visitors alike. Today the tower is most breathtaking at night, when every girder is highlighted in a sparkling display originally conceived to celebrate the turn of the millennium. The glittering light show was so popular that the 20,000 lights were reinstalled for permanent use in 2003. The tower does its electric shimmy for 10 minutes every hour on the hour until 1 AM in winter and 2 AM in summer.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You can stride up the stairs as far as the third floor, but if you want to go to the top you\'ll have to take the elevator. (Be sure to take a close look at the fantastic ironwork.) The view of the flat sweep of Paris at 1,000 feet may not beat that from the Tour Montparnasse skyscraper, but the setting makes it considerably more romantic, especially if you come in the late evening, after the crowds have dispersed. www.tour-eiffel.fr. COST: By elevator: 2nd fl. EUR 4.50, 3rd fl. EUR 7.80, 4th fl. EUR 11.50. Climbing: 2nd and 3rd fl. only, EUR 4. OPEN: June-late Aug., daily 9 AM-midnight; late Aug.-May, daily 9 AM-11 PM, stairs close at dusk in winter. Metro: Bir-Hakeim, Trocadéro, Ecole Militaire; RER: Champ de Mars. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Notre-Dame</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Looming above place du Parvis on the Île de la Cité is the Cathédrale de Notre-Dame, the most enduring symbol of Paris. Begun in 1163, completed in 1345, badly damaged during the Revolution, and restored by the architect EugèneViollet-le-Duc in the 19th century, Notre-Dame may not be France\'s oldest or largest cathedral, but in beauty and architectural harmony it has few peers—as you can see by studying the facade from the open square. The front entranceways seem like hands joined in prayer, the sculpted kings on the facade form a noble procession, and the west (front) rose window gleams with what seems like divine light. The most dramatic approach to Notre-Dame is from the Rive Gauche, crossing at the Pont au Double from quai de Montebello, at the St-Michel mètro or RER stop. This bridge will take you to the open square, place du Parvis, in front of the cathedral. This area is kilomètre zéro, the spot from which all distances to and from the city are offi cially measured. A polished brass circle set in the ground, about 20 yards from the cathedral\'s main entrance, marks the exact spot.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A separate entrance, to the left of the front facade if you\'re facing it, leads to the 387 stone steps of the south tower. These steps take you to the bell of Notre-Dame—as tolled by the fictional Quasimodo. Quasimodo was created by Victor Hugo in the novel <i>Notre-Dame de Paris</i>, published in 1831. The incredible popularity of the book made Parisians finally take notice of the cathedral\'s state of disrepair and spurred Viollet-le-Duc\'s renovations. These included the addition of the gargoyles (though technically these are chimeras, as they lack the functioning waterspout of true \"gargoyles\"), among other things, and resulted in the structure we see today. Looking out from the tower, you can see how Paris—like the trunk of a tree developing new rings—has grown outward from the Ile de la Cité. To the north is Montmartre; to the west is the Arc de Triomphe, at the top of the Champs-Elysées; and to the south are the towers of St-Sulpice and the Panthéon. TIP Lines to climb the tower are shortest on weekday mornings.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Notre-Dame was one of the first Gothic cathedrals in Europe and one of the first buildings to make use of <b>flying buttresses</b> —exterior supports that spread out the weight of the building and roof. At first people thought they looked like scaffolding that the builders forgot to remove. TIP The most tranquil place to appreciate the architecture of Notre-Dame is from the lovely garden behind the cathedral, Square Jean-XXIII. By night, take a boat ride on the Seine for the best view—the lights at night are magnificent.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The West (front) facade has three main entrances: the Portal of the Virgin, on the left; the Portal of the Last Judgment, in the center; and the Portal of St. Anne (the oldest of the three), on the right. As you enter the nave, the faith of the early builders permeates the quiet interior: the soft glow of the stained glass windows contrasts with the triumphant glory of the exterior. The best time to visit is early in the morning, when the cathedral is at its brightest and least crowded. At the entrance are the massive 12th-century columns supporting the towers. Look down the nave to the transepts—the arms of the church—where, at the south (right) entrance to the choir, you\'ll glimpse the haunting 12th-century statue of <b>Notre-Dame de Paris</b>, <i>Our Lady of Paris,</i> for whom the cathedral is named. On the south side of the choir is the <b>Treasury</b>, with a small collection of garments, reliquaries, and silver and gold plate. Behind the choir you can see <b>The Pietà</b>, representing the Virgin Mary mourning over the dead body of Christ. The <b>biblical scenes</b> on the north and south screens of the choir depict the life of Christ and the apparitions of Christ after the Resurrection. On the north side, the north rose window is one of the cathedral\'s original stained-glass panels; at the center is an image of Mary holding a young Jesus.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Down the stairs in front of the cathedral is the <b>Crypte Archéologique</b>, Notre-Dame\'s archaeological museum. It gives an \"under the city\" view of the area, with remains from previous churches that were built on this site, scale models charting the district\'s development, and artifacts dating from 2,000 years ago. The <b>Musée de Notre-Dame</b>, on the other hand, has little to interest the average visitor. www.monum.fr. COST: Cathedral free, towers EUR 7.50, crypt EUR 3.30, treasury EUR 2.50, museum EUR 2.50. OPEN: Cathedral daily 8-6:45. Towers Apr.-June and Sept., daily 10 AM-6:30; July and Aug., weekdays 10-6:30, weekends 10 AM-11 PM; Oct.-Mar., daily 10-5:30. Note towers close early when over-crowded.

It\'s unlikely you\'ll cover the whole state, even if you decide to permanently relocate. To narrow down your choices, consider whether you have a few days to spend in and around Perth and Fremantle. Does the thought of cooler air and the coastal scenery of the South West appeal to you, or would you rather get in a car and drive to far reaches east or north? Or, do you want to trek north along the coast to Monkey Mia or Ningaloo Reef Marine Park to frolic in and under the waves with amazing sea creatures?</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend most of the first day knocking around <b>Perth</b> \'s city center. Take the train to pleasantly restored <b>Fremantle</b> and stroll through the streets, stopping for breaks at sidewalk cafés. In the evening in either city, have dinner overlooking the water. Over the next two days, take a ferry to <b>Rottnest Island</b> and cycle around, walk on the beach, fish, or try to spot the small local marsupials called quokkas. For a longer excursion, take a coach tour to <b>Nambung National Park</b> Pinnacles, the captivating coastal rock formations, or south to the Treetop Walk.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 5 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Now you can take on some of the larger distances in Western Australia. Fly north to <b>Monkey Mia</b> to learn about and interact with dolphins, or to <b>Ningaloo Reef Marine Park</b> to dive with whale sharks and watch the annual coral spawning. Or drive a couple of hours to the <b>South West</b> coastal area to see spring wildflowers, wineries, orchards, forests, grazing dairy and beef herds, and national parks, and to generally enjoy the good life. You\'ll have enough time for a day or two around <b>Perth</b> before flying to the old goldfields towns of <b>Kalgoorlie</b> and <b>Coolgardie.</b> They may remind you of America\'s Wild West—except that camel teams rather than stagecoaches used to pull into town—but this is pure Oz all the way.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 7 Days or More</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With seven days you can consider all options, mixing parts of the three- and five-day itineraries. Of course, you could opt to spend the entire week leisurely making your way along the coast of the <b>South West,</b> tasting the top-quality regional wines and locally grown foods. Or, you could head for the caves and rough shorelines that define <b>Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park.

It houses <i>Australia 11,</i> winner of the 1983 America\'s Cup, and the hands-on exhibits are great fun for children. You can also take one-hour guided tours of the adjacent submarine <i>Ovens,</i> a former Royal Australian Navy World War II submarine. The Shipwreck Gallery houses the recovered remains of the Dutch wrecks, including the <i>Batavia</i> (wrecked offshore in 1629), and the 1872 SS <i>Xantho</i> steamer. www.museum.wa.gov.au/maritime. COST: Museum A$10 day pass, museum and Ovens A$15, gallery free. OPEN: Museum and gallery daily 9:30-5, Ovens Fri.-Sun. and school holidays 10-4:30. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ningaloo Reef Marine Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">1,512 km (937 mi) north of Perth, 550 km (341 mi) from Monkey Mia.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Some of Australia\'s most pristine coral reef runs 251 km (156 mi) along the coast of the Exmouth Peninsula, very far north of Perth. A happy conjunction of migratory routes and accessibility makes it one of the best places on Earth to see huge manta rays, giant whale sharks, humpback whales, nesting turtles, and the annual coral spawning. Exmouth makes a good overnight base for exploring the marine park.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The beauty of Exmouth doesn\'t end at the seashore. Also worth seeing near Exmouth is the <b>Cape Range National Park</b>, including the Yardie Creek Gorge, a ruggedly beautiful area that\'s excellent for an Outback holiday. Covering more than 123,000 acres, the national park includes red-rock canyons, limestone ranges, and 50 km (31 mi) of pristine beaches. The abundant wildlife includes emus and red kangaroos. A highlight of the winter season is the profusion of wildflowers, which include the Sturt Desert Pea and the Bird Flower. Follow N.W. Coastal Hwy. north 1,170 km (725 mi) to Minilya turnoff; Exmouth is 374 km (232 mi) farther north. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Monkey Mia</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">985 km (611 mi) north of Perth, 450 km (280 mi) from Karijini National Park.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Monkey Mia is a World Heritage Site and the setting for one of the world\'s most extraordinary natural wonders; nowhere else do wild dolphins interact so freely with human beings. In 1964 a woman from one of the makeshift fishing camps in the area hand-fed one of the dolphins that regularly followed the fishing boats home. Other dolphins followed that lead, and an extensive family of wild dolphins now comes of its own accord to be fed.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For many, standing in the shallow waters of Shark Bay to hand-feed a dolphin is the experience of a lifetime. There are no set feeding times. Dolphins show up at any hour of the day at the public beach, where park rangers feed them. Rangers share their food with people who want to get close to the sea creatures. The Monkey Mia Visitor Centre has videos and information. COST: Free. OPEN: Information center daily 7-4:30. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Begin with the basic hoagie roll, which should be slightly crusty with a good amount of chew-Amoroso\'s is a popular choice. Add to that extremely thin-sliced strips of top round, grilled over a bed of onions until well browned. Then, if you want the full effect, request your sandwich \"wit,\" as in a ladle of Cheez Whiz over the top. Other cheeses may also be used, including American and provolone, depending on the cultural etiquette of the particular establishment. As befitting a cultural touchstone, there are many other homages on Philly menus, including chicken cheesesteaks, cheesesteak egg rolls, even vegetarian cheesesteaks. In fact, Philadelphians are so enamored of their signature sandwich that even high-end restaurants pay their respects—including a famous $100 version at Stephen Starr\'s steak house, Barclay Prime.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">BYOBs</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Being able to \"bring your own booze\" to Philly restaurants is a shining example of an unexpectedly positive outcome from government bureaucracy. Due to Pennsylvania\'s draconian liquor laws, liquor licenses are extremely expensive to get. For many small cafés, it\'s not financially feasible to pay for a license, so many go in another direction. For no additional fee, customers can bring their own drink of choice. Most commonly, BYOBs tend to be either Italian (in great abundance in Bella Vista and Queen Village) or French, but there are a growing number of other options, including Mexican, Thai, and Middle Eastern. Vive la gouvernement!</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Squares</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Philly was founded on the idea that a city should have large amounts of open, green space for its residents. The most famous square remains wealthy Rittenhouse, between 18th, 19th, Walnut, and Rittenhouse streets. Rittenhouse is surrounded by posh cafés, boutiques, and hotels, and on weekends crawls with singles sunning themselves, parents with double strollers, and wedding parties posing for pictures. Washington Square, between 6th, 7th, and Walnut streets and Washington Square Road, has somewhat sleeker restaurants and a hipper crowd. Franklin Square, between 6th, 7th, Race, and Vine streets, is a haven for kids with a mini golf course, merry-go-round, and several playgrounds. Logan Square, between 18th, 20th, Race, and Vine streets, is essentially a massive fountain where kids play. Its proximity to the library and art museum make it one of the city\'s best squares to bring a picnic lunch.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fairmount Park</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At a robust 9,200 acres, it includes 63 smaller neighborhood parks, but the main area sits in the northwest section of the city. Start on Kelly Drive, right near the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and work your way out toward the north and west. In warm weather, people swarm to Kelly and West River drives on either side of the Schuylkill to blade, bike, run. For the serious mountain biker, there\'s the Wissahickon Loop, a 30-mi circuit. Further out is the Horticultural Center, which houses an arboretum, greenhouse, and a striking Japanese garden. As you head toward Germantown, the park becomes dense forest ideal for rock climbers, equestrians, and bird-watchers.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Best Brunch</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just as Philadelphians are famous for their disputes over who makes the best cheesesteak, the best hoagie roll, the best water ice, and the best cannoli, each neighborhood has its own ongoing debate for \"best brunch.\" Here are some of the contenders:</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Azure</b> (931 N. 2nd St., Northern Liberties. tel. 215/629-0500) is hard to pin down, but that\'s what makes brunch here so fun (not to mention the four-dollar brunch cocktails). On the menu: baked brie in puff pastry, French toast stuffed with peanut butter and banana, and Monte Cristo sandwiches (a turkey, ham, and swiss sandwich dipped in egg wash, grilled, and served with maple syrup). Vegans and vegetarians will find lots to eat here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Mixto</b> (1229 Spruce St., Center City. tel. 215/592-0363) mixes Latin American and Caribbean cuisine in an airy, two-story space a few blocks below Broad Street. The food is plentiful and slightly greasy, and Latin music sets the mood for mimosas.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Sabrina\'s Cafe</b> (910 Christian St., South Philadelphia. tel. 215/574-1599) is a cozy former bakery around the corner from the Italian Market that often has two-hour waits for its Sunday brunch. Here\'s what they\'re waiting for: apple and sharp cheddar omelets, homemade granola, and stuffed and caramelized challah French toast with vanilla bean maple syrup.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Valanni</b> (1141-43 Pine St., Center City. tel. 215/790-9494) is a hip lounge-restaurant in the evening. Some of those revelers show up late morning to order some of the chef\'s new twists on old favorites, like lemon ricotta pancakes with fresh berries and blueberry-mascarpone crepes.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Philadelphia in 5 Days</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In a city with as many richly stocked museums and matchless marvels as Philadelphia, you risk seeing half of everything or all of nothing. So use the efficient itineraries below to keep you on track as you explore both the famous sights and those off the beaten path.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 1</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Begin your first day with an exploration of the city\'s historic district. Sign up at the Independence National Historical Park Visitor Center for a walking tour hosted by a National Park Service guide; try a go-at-your-own-pace tour offered by Audio Walk and Tour; or take a walk on your own. For lunch, proceed to the Reading Terminal Market, where you can sample the real Philadelphia \"cuisine\"—cheesesteaks, soft pretzels, and Bassett\'s ice cream—or something else from the dozens of food stalls). After lunch, walk nine blocks east on Arch Street (or take a bus on Market Street) to Old City; Christ Church, the Betsy Ross House, and Elfreth\'s Alley are all in close proximity. The galleries and cafés in the area may tempt you to take a short break from your pursuit of history. In the late afternoon, head back to Independence Hall for a horse-drawn carriage ride. Have dinner in Old City; then catch the Lights of Liberty walking sound-and-light show (March-December, weather permitting).</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 2</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend the morning of Day 2 exploring the Philadelphia Museum of Art on Benjamin Franklin Parkway, followed by lunch in the museum\'s lovely dining room. Afterward, depending on your interests and the day of the week, you could head to Merion by bus or car to see the world-renowned collection of impressionist paintings at the Barnes Foundation (open Friday-Sunday). Or you could walk to Eastern State Penitentiary Historic Site for a tour of a former prison or to the Franklin Institute Science Museum.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 3</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Start Day 3 in Center City with a ride to the top of City Hall for a pigeon\'s-eye view of the city. Next, head across the street to the Masonic Temple for a surreal tour through time—and architectural history—led by a Mason. Art lovers may prefer a visit to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, two blocks north of City Hall at Broad and Cherry streets. Eat lunch at the Reading Terminal Market.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you want to stay inside, head to Rittenhouse Square\'s Rosenbach Museum and Library, which has a diverse collection ranging from the original manuscript of James Joyce\'s <i>Ulysses</i> to the works of beloved children\'s author Maurice Sendak. If you prefer being outdoors, visit Penn\'s Landing, where you can check out the Independence Seaport Museum and/or take the ferry across the river to the Adventure Aquarium and Camden Children\'s Garden. At sunset, have a drink on the deck of the <i>Moshulu</i>.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 4</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Begin Day 4 by exploring either Society Hill or the Rittenhouse Square area. Then take a bus west on Walnut Street to the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, in University City. You can have lunch at the museum or on campus. In the afternoon, return to Center City to the corner of 16th Street and John F. Kennedy Boulevard, to pick up the Philadelphia Trolley Works\' narrated tour of Fairmount Park; or if you have children along, visit the Philadelphia Zoo. Afterward, drive or catch the SEPTA R6 train to Manayunk, where you can have dinner in one of the restaurants lining Main Street; many stores here are open late, too.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 5</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On Day 5, head out of the city by car to Valley Forge National Historical Park, where you can hike or picnic after you\'ve taken the self-guided auto tour of General Washington\'s winter encampment. If you like to shop, spend the afternoon at the nearby King of Prussia Mall. Or drive back toward the city to take in the Barnes Foundation, the Eastern State Penitentiary, or the Franklin Institute—whichever ones you didn\'t see on Day 2.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Another option for Day 5 is to stay in the city and explore Queen Village in Southwark and South Philadelphia. Follow up a visit to the Mummers Museum with a strut along 9th Street, site of the outdoor Italian Market. You can pick up the makings for a great picnic, or duck into one of the restaurants here for lunch. In the afternoon, visit the museums you missed on Day 2. Check the local papers for an evening activity—perhaps a sporting event at the South Philadelphia stadiums, a show in Center City, or live music at a jazz club.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 2 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You could easily spend two weeks exploring Philadelphia, but if you have only a few days, you can still get a good taste of what the city has to offer. You\'ll want to get the tour of the historic sights out of the way on Day 1. Either follow the itinerary above, or forgo the Lights of Liberty show and check out Old City\'s bars and clubs instead. Then spend a leisurely day exploring either the Philadelphia Museum of Art or the Barnes Foundation. Wrap up Day 2 with a stroll around Rittenhouse Square or through Fairmount Park.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Walk Through U.S. History</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The best place to orient yourself is at the <b>Independence Visitor Center</b> on 6th Street between Market and Arch. A block to the north is the contemporary <b>National Constitution Center</b> and <b>Franklin Square,</b> which has a carousel and a miniature-golf course. Directly across Market Street is the gathering area for the <b>Liberty Bell Pavilion</b>, an angled glass building with fine sightlines of Independence Hall. Cross Chestnut Street to <b>Independence Square,</b> site of <b>Independence Hall</b>, where the Declaration of Independence was signed; tours begin in the courtyard alongside <b>Old City Hall</b>, home of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1791 to 1800. Just in front of it is Philosophical Hall, home of the country\'s oldest learned society. Independence Hall is flanked by <b>Congress Hall</b>, which holds the chambers of the first U.S. Congress.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Next, cross 5th Street to the cobblestone Library Street, where you can see <b>Library Hall</b>, a reconstruction of the first public library in the United States. Just before 4th Street on the left is the Parthenon look-alike, the <b>Second Bank of the United States</b>, with its portrait gallery of Colonial Americans; its entrance is on Chestnut Street. Crossing 4th Street, follow a redbrick path to the Carpenters\' Court; <b>Carpenters\' Hall</b>, with its displays of 18th-century tools, is on your right. On your left is Pemberton House, now a bookstore and gift shop. Behind the bookstore is the <b>New Hall Military Museum</b>; it contains a variety of weapons and uniforms. Leave Carpenters\' Court and continue on the redbrick path alongside manicured lawns and ancient oaks and maples east to 3rd Street, site of the <b>First Bank of the United States</b>, a handsome example of Federal architecture.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Walk north on 3rd Street, cross Chestnut Street, and turn left to the <b>National Liberty Museum</b>; the exhibits here celebrate diversity and honor Nobel Peace Prize winners. Your next stop should be <b>Franklin Court</b>. Just past the National Liberty Museum, turn right through the gates and walk down the cobblestone path. Head into the underground museum that celebrates the achievements of Benjamin Franklin, and visit the Colonial-era print shop and post office. Exit on Market Street and turn left. Walk several blocks, passing the Liberty Bell and the visitor center, and turn left on 7th Street. On your right, you can see the reconstructed <b>Declaration House</b>, where Thomas Jefferson wrote his rough draft of the Declaration of Independence, and a branch of the Free Library of Philadelphia. Across 7th Street is the <b>Atwater Kent Museum</b>, which chronicles the city\'s history. Next to the museum is a walkway under the Rohm and Haas Building. You\'ll pass the sculpture-fountain <i>Milkweed Pod.</i> At 6th Street turn right and walk south almost to Walnut Street to the <b>Curtis Center</b>; peek into the lobby to see the mural by Maxfield Parrish and Louis Comfort Tiffany.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Continue east on Walnut Street. On the corner of 4th and Walnut is the <b>Todd House</b>, home of Dolley Madison; it stands in contrast with the lavish <b>Bishop White House</b>, at 3rd and Walnut. Follow Walnut a half block east to Philadelphia Merchant\'s Exchange, the city\'s commercial center for part of the 19th century. Around the corner at 2nd, between Walnut and Sansom, is <b>Welcome Park</b>, marking the spot where William Penn once lived.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

That was the way Albert C. Barnes wanted it. The son of a Philadelphia butcher who made millions by inventing Argyrol (used to treat eye inflammations), Barnes considered his art collection an educational tool, and until a 1961 court order the collection was open only to students of the educational institution he had chartered. Now that the trustees of Lincoln University have taken over, Barnes\'s public-be-damned attitude is a thing of the past. Recently, the Foundation was given permission by the court to relocate its gallery to a new building on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, next to the Rodin Museum. Until 2009 you can see the Gauguins, Tintorettos, and Degases displayed as they have always been: wallpapered floor-to-ceiling and cheek-by-jowl alongside household tools, Amish chests, and New Mexican folk icons. Reservations are required, and should be made at least two months in advance for the busiest months of April, May, October, and November. If you don\'t arrive in time to join the limited first-come, first-served docent tours, at 10, 1, and 2, opt for the $7 audio tour. SEPTA\'s Ardmore-bound 44 bus runs from 15th Street and Kennedy Boulevard to Old Lancaster Road and North Latches Lane half a block from the museum; or take SEPTA\'s R-5 train from 30th Street Station to the Merion Station stop, turn right on Merion Road and left on Latch\'s Lane, and walk ½ mi to the museum. www.barnesfoundation.org. COST: $10. OPEN: Sept.-June, Fri.-Sun. 9:30-5; July and Aug., Wed.-Fri. 9:30-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Philadelphia Museum of Art</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city\'s premier cultural attraction is one of the country\'s leading museums. One of the greatest treasures of the museum is the building itself. Constructed in 1928 of Minnesota dolomite, it\'s modeled after ancient Greek temples but on a grander scale. The museum was designed by Julian Francis Abele, the first African-American to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania School of Architecture. You can enter the museum from the front or the rear; choose the front and you can run up the 99 steps made famous in the movie <i>Rocky.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once inside, you\'ll see the grand staircase and Saint-Gaudens\'s statue <i>Diana;</i> she formerly graced New York\'s old Madison Square Garden. The museum has several outstanding permanent collections: the John G. Johnson Collection covers Western art from the Renaissance to the 19th century; the Arensberg and A. E. Gallatin collections contain modern and contemporary works by artists such as Brancusi, Braque, Matisse, and Picasso. Famous paintings in these collections include Van Eyck\'s <i>St. Francis Receiving the Stigmata,</i> Rubens\'s <i>Prometheus Bound,</i> Benjamin West\'s <i>Benjamin Franklin Drawing Electricity from the Sky,</i> Van Gogh\'s <i>Sunflowers,</i> Cézanne\'s <i>The Large Bathers,</i> and Picasso\'s <i>Three Musicians.</i> The museum has the world\'s most extensive collection of works by Marcel Duchamp, including the world-famous <i>Nude Descending a Staircase</i> and <i>The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even.</i> Among the American art worth seeking out is a fine selection of works by 19th-century Philadelphia artist Thomas Eakins, including <i>The Concert Singer.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Perhaps the most spectacular objects in the museum are entire structures and great rooms moved lock, stock, and barrel from around the world: a 12th-century French cloister, a 16th-century Indian temple hall, a 16th-century Japanese Buddhist temple, a 17th-century Chinese palace hall, and a Japanese ceremonial teahouse. Among the other collections are costumes, Early American furniture, and Amish and Shaker crafts. An unusual touch—and one that children especially like—is the Kienbusch Collection of Arms and Armor.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The newly opened Ruth and Raymond G. Perelman Building, across the street in the former Reliance Standard Life Insurance Building, is home to the museum\'s permanent collection of photography, costume, and contemporary design.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Friday evenings feature live jazz performances in the Great Hall. The museum has a fine restaurant and a surprisingly good cafeteria. www.philamuseum.org. COST: $10, Sun. pay what you wish. OPEN: Tues., Thurs., and weekends 10-5; Wed. and Fri. 10-8:45. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Vieques</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This island off Puerto Rico\'s east coast is famed for its Playa Sun Bay, a gorgeous stretch of sand with picnic facilities and shade trees. In May 2003, the U.S. Navy withdrew from its military operations and turned over two-thirds of Vieques to the local government, which is transforming it into the Vieques National Wildlife Refuge. Vieques has two communities—Isabel Segunda, where the ferries dock, and the smaller Esperanza. Both have restaurants and hotels that will surprise you with their sophistication.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In addition to great beaches, Vieques has one attraction that draws visitors from all over the world. <b>Bahía Mosquito</b> (Mosquito Bay) is best experienced on moonless nights, when millions of bioluminescent organisms glow when disturbed—it\'s like swimming in a cloud of fireflies. If you\'re on the island, this is a not-to-be-missed experience. Several local companies lead trips to the bay, either by kayak or by nonpolluting electric boats. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">El Yunque</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">More than 28,000 acres of verdant foliage and rare wildlife make up El Yunque, the only rain forest within the U.S. National Forest system. Formally known as the El Yunque National Forest, El Yunque\'s odd name is believed to be derived from the Taíno word <i>yukiyú</i> (good spirit), although some people say it comes directly from <i>yunque,</i> the Spanish word for \"anvil,\" because some of the forest\'s peaks have flattened tops. More than 100 billion gallons of precipitation fall here annually, spawning rushing streams and cascades, 240 tree species, and oversize impatiens and ferns. In the evening, millions of inch-long <i>coquís</i> (tree frogs) begin their calls. El Yunque is also home to the <i>cotorra,</i> Puerto Rico\'s endangered green parrot, as well as 67 other types of birds.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The forest\'s 13 hiking trails are well maintained; many of them are easy to walk and less than a mile long. Before you begin exploring, check out the high-tech interactive displays—explaining rain forests in general and El Yunque in particular—at <b>El Portal</b> (Rte. 191, Km 4.3, 00745. tel. 787/888-1880. www.fs.fed.us/r8/el_yunque), the information center near the northern entrance. This is also a good place to pick up a map of the park and talk to rangers about weather conditions or which trails are open. You can also stock up on water, snacks, film, and souvenirs at the small gift shop. The center is open daily from 9 to 4:30; admission is $3. The park itself, which is free, is open daily 7:30 to 6. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Having migrated from northwestern Mexico, Hohokam cultivated cotton, corn, and beans in tilled, rowed, and irrigated fields for about 1,700 years, establishing more than 300 mi of canals—an engineering miracle when you consider the limited technology available. They constructed a great town upon whose ruins modern Phoenix is built, and then vanished. Drought, long winters, and other causes are suggested for their disappearance.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Modern Beginnings</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the time the Hohokam left until the Civil War the once fertile Salt River valley lay forgotten, used only by occasional small bands of Pima and Maricopa Indians. Then in 1865 the U.S. Army established Fort McDowell in the mountains to the east, where the Verde River flows into the Salt River. To feed the men and the horses stationed there, a former Confederate Army officer reopened the Hohokam canals in 1867. Within a year, fields bright with barley and pumpkins earned the area the name Pumpkinville. By 1870 the 300 residents had decided that their new city would arise from the ancient Hohokam site, just as the mythical phoenix rose from its own ashes.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">A City on the Rise</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Phoenix would grow indeed. Within 20 years it had become large enough—its population was about 3,000—to wrest the title of territorial capital from Prescott. By 1912, when Arizona was admitted as the 48th state, the area, irrigated by the brand-new Roosevelt Dam and Salt River Project, had a burgeoning cotton industry. Copper was mined elsewhere but traded in Phoenix, and cattle were raised elsewhere but slaughtered and packed here in the largest stockyards outside of Chicago.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Meanwhile, the climate, so long a crippling liability, became an asset. Desert air was the prescribed therapy for the respiratory ills rampant in the sooty, factory-filled East; Scottsdale began in 1901 as \"30-odd tents and a half dozen adobe houses\" put up by health-seekers. By 1930 travelers looking for warm-winter recreation as well as rejuvenating aridity filled the elegant San Marcos Hotel and Arizona Biltmore, the first of the many luxury retreats for which the area is now known worldwide. The 1950s brought residential air-conditioning, an invention that made the summers bearable for the growing workforce of the burgeoning technology industry.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Phoenix Today</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Valley is very much a work still in progress, and historians are quick to point out that never in the world\'s history has a metropolis grown from \"nothing\" to attain the status of Phoenix in such a short period of time. At the heart of all the bustle, though, is a way of life that keeps its own pace: Phoenix is one of the world\'s largest small towns—where people dress informally and where the rugged, Old West spirit lives on in many of the Valley\'s nooks and crannies despite the sprawling growth. And if the summer heat can be overwhelming, at least it has the restorative effect of slowing things down to an enjoyable pace.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Today the site is a National Historic Landmark and still an active community of students and architects. Wright and apprentices constructed a desert camp here using organic architecture to integrate the buildings with their natural surroundings. In addition to the living quarters, drafting studio, and small apartments of the Apprentice Court, Taliesin West has two theaters, a music pavilion, and the Sun Trap—sleeping spaces surrounding an open patio and fireplace. Five guided tours are offered, ranging from a one-hour \"panorama\" tour to a three-hour behind-the-scenes tour, with other tours offered seasonally; all visitors must be accompanied by a guide. Wear comfortable shoes for walking. The half-hour drive from downtown Scottsdale is very worthwhile. Drive north on the 101 Freeway to Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard.

Today the staggering collection includes such exhibits as a Navajo hogan, an Apache wickieup (a temporary Native American structure, similar to a lean-to, constructed from branches, twigs, and leaves, sometimes covered with hides), and rooms filled with art, pottery, jewelry, kachinas, and textiles. The Heard also actively supports Indian artists and displays their work. A fabulous long-term exhibition called \"Home: Native People in the Southwest,\" opened in 2005. Annual events include the Guild Indian Fair &amp; Market and the World Championship Hoop Dance Contest. Children enjoy the interactive art-making exhibits. The museum also has an incredible gift shop with authentic, high-quality goods purchased directly from Native American artists. There\'s a museum satellite branch in Scottsdale that has rotating exhibits, and another in the West Valley featuring some of the Heard\'s permanent collection as well as rotating exhibits. www.heard.org.

Pattaya and Koh Samet are year-round destinations. Many places on Koh Chang and the other islands in the archipelago close down during the rainy season because the seas are rough, making boat travel difficult, and the rainy weather keeps visitors to a minimum. The big car ferries, however, continue to run on a limited schedule, and the larger resorts and many medium-range hotels stay open, offering cheaper rates.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cha-Am and Hua Hin are year-round locations, particularly Hua Hin, which is a developed historical city that has more to offer than just the beach.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As you head farther south, the peak season depends on which side of Thailand you visit. On the Western Gulf side (including Koh Samui, Koh Phangan, and Koh Tao) the monsoon season runs from late October through December; at this time—with the exception of the week from Christmas to New Year\'s—prices can be halved. Peak season in the Western Gulf runs from January through early July. But even during the off-season flying to Koh Samui is still convenient, making it a year-round location. The peak season on the west coast along the Andaman Sea is November through April. The monsoon season is May through October, during which high seas can make beaches unsafe for swimming, though hotel prices are considerably lower.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The diving around the Similan Islands is world class, with visibility of up to 120 feet; abundant blue, green, and purple coral; and rare marine life, such as the whale shark, the world\'s largest fish. The tsunami had a considerable effect on the islands. Shallow reefs were particularly hard hit, and as of this writing islands 1, 2, and 3 were indefinitely closed to divers, snorkelers, and visitors. However, many reefs were less affected and the underwater experience on the Similan Islands is fantastic. If you plan to dive, contact a dive operator in Phuket or Khao Lak; there are no dive shops on the islands, though snorkeling gear is available for rent from the ranger stations.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In addition to sparkling, crystal-clear water, the Similan Islands also have ultrafine, powdery white-sand beaches and lush tropical forests. The national park service allows visitors to stay on the beaches of Koh Miang (Island 4) and Koh Similan (Island 8). Koh Miang, where the park headquarters is located, has bungalows with 24-hour electricity and even some with air-conditioning (B2,000 with air-conditioning, B1,000 without); some bungalows have ocean views as well. Beachside camping is also available on Koh Miang (the park rents out roomy tents, large enough to stand in, which have two camping cots, for B450). Koh Similan has no bungalows, but has the same large tents for rent (B450), as well as an area for visitors to set up their own tents for B80 per person. If you choose to visit the island to stay at the park, expect to pay B1,800-B2,000 for a round-trip boat transfer. Once on the island, you can hire a longtail boat to explore the other islands for about B500 per day. Alternatively, tour groups, such as <b>Jack\'s Similan</b> (tel. 076/443205. www.jacksimilan.com), have their own smaller tents set up in this area and rent them out for the same fee charged by the national park. There are also overnight packages, which include tours of the islands, as well as camping and food.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The park is extremely popular with Thais, so book well in advance if you\'re planning a visit during a Thai holiday. The islands are more enjoyable, and more explorable, if visited midweek. The park entrance fee is B200 per visit. Note that the islands are normally closed to visitors from mid-May until early November. www.dnp.go.th. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Phang Nga Bay National Marine Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The best way—actually, the only way—to visit Phang Nga Bay is by boat. Talk with one of the travel agencies on Phuket that offer half-day tours of the area or hire your own boat and spend as long as you want. There are two inlets, just before you reach the town of Phang Nga, where you can arrange for longtail boats. Most tour buses go to the western inlet, where you can rent a boat for about B1,300 for two hours. The second inlet sees fewer foreign tourists, so the prices are better—about B800 for three hours. The bay can be explored via tour boat, speedboat, or sea canoe. Most tourists don\'t arrive from Phuket until 11 AM, so if you get into the bay earlier, you can explore it in solitude. To get an early start, you may want to stay overnight in the area. Be sure to take time to appreciate the sunsets, which are particularly beautiful on the island of <b>Koh Mak.</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are several key sights around Phang Nga Bay. The island of <b>Koh Panyi</b> has a Muslim fishing village consisting of houses built on stilts. Restaurants are no bargain, tripling their prices for tourists. Beautiful <b>Koh Phing Kan,</b> now known locally as James Bond Island, is well worth a visit. The island of <b>Koh Tapu</b> resembles a nail driven into the sea. <b>Kao Kien</b> has overhanging cliffs covered with primitive paintings of elephants, fish, and crabs. Many are thought to be at least 3,500 years old. <b>Tham Lot</b> is a stalactite-studded cave that has an opening large enough for boats to pass through. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Kaufmann, who had made a fortune as owner of Kaufmann\'s, Pittsburgh\'s premier department store, hired Frank Lloyd Wright to design a weekend retreat for his family on a piece of land in Mill Run. Wright\'s design incorporated much of what was already on the site, including rocks, trees, and a rushing creek. Battles of will between Kaufmann and Wright over the details of the design became legendary. Wright wanted to cover the concrete parapets of the house with gold leaf; Kaufmann didn\'t. Kaufmann wanted a swimming pool on one of the balconies; Wright didn\'t. Despite their many differences, though, they produced a grand house.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tours of the house are essential not just for what you see but for the stories you hear.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><i>To get to Fallingwater, take the Pennsylvania Turnpike southeast from Pittsburgh to Donegal Exit, then take Route 31 east to Route 381 south and look for signs; 724-329-8501.</i></div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bonus Dwelling</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A few miles southwest of Fallingwater is another Frank Lloyd Wright house, <b>Kentuck Knob.</b> Typical of the Usonian style Wright developed between 1930 and his death in 1959, the design for Kentuck Knob emphasizes openness with a single-floor plan without basement or attic. A strict triangular grid pattern makes rooms appear larger than they really are. Tours for up to 15 people are conducted year-round, weather permitting.

Ask that same person about Pennsylvania businesses and thoughts of steel and railroads might enter the conversation. But, there\'s more to Pennsylvania\'s business sector than factories and steel.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Beer has long played a part in Pennsylvania\'s history. In a time when micro-breweries are popping up all over the country, Pennsylvania\'s Yuengling Brewery holds the distinction of being the oldest brewery in America. Straub Brewery is the smallest pre-prohibition brewery in the nation. Nearly every large town—and even some smaller towns—has a brewery within its limits. And, except for Latrobe\'s Rolling Rock, none of the state\'s breweries mass-produce their beer. The breweries cater to a loyal Pennsylvania following.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are more than 50 brewing establishments in the state, more than in any state in the country, and many of those are in the brewpub category. Unlike their big brothers, brewpubs cater to the restaurant crowd as well as to lovers of suds. Their locations range from the traditional roadside restaurant to pubs in a small commercial airport, a converted church, factory buildings, and old movie theaters.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">So while in northern California you can sip some of the world\'s greatest wines, in Pennsylvania you can enjoy some suds with history and tour facilities that have been around since before the turn of the 20th century.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Visit the Portland Art Museum or the Oregon History Center, stop by the historic First Congregational Church and Pioneer Courthouse Square, and take a stroll along the Park Blocks or Waterfront Park. Eat lunch and do a little shopping along Northwest 23rd Avenue in the early afternoon, and be sure to get a look at the beautiful historic homes in Nob Hill. From there, drive up into the northwest hills by the Pittock Mansion, and finish off the afternoon at the Japanese Garden and the International Test Rose Garden in Washington Park. If you still have energy, head across the river for dinner on Hawthorne Boulevard; then drive up to Mt. Tabor Park for Portland\'s best sunset.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On your first day, follow the itinerary above, but stay on the west side for dinner, and take your evening stroll in Waterfront Park. On your second morning, visit the Portland Classical Chinese Garden in Old Town, and then head across the river to the Sellwood District for lunch and antiquing. Stop by the Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden; then head up to Hawthorne District in the afternoon. Wander through the Hawthorne and Belmont neighborhoods for a couple hours, stop by Laurelhurst Park, and take a picnic dinner up to Mt. Tabor Park. In the evening, catch a movie at the Bagdad Theatre, or get a beer at one of the east side brewpubs. On Day 3, take a morning hike in Hoyt Arboretum or Forest Park; then spend your afternoon exploring shops and galleries in the Pearl District and on northeast Alberta Street. Drive out to the Grotto, and then eat dinner at the Kennedy School or one of the other McMenamins brewpubs.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 7 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With a full week, you have time to slow down and take your time in the city. Follow the suggestions outlined above, but spread them out over four days instead of three. Then it\'s time to get out of town. Whether you drive through the beautiful Columbia Gorge, head to the coast, or explore the Oregon wine country, there\'s plenty to see within a few hours drive. See Chapter 8,\"Side Trips from Portland,\" for inspiration and help in planning the rest of your week.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Getting Around Portland</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most visitors comment about how easy it is to get around Portland. The Willamette River is Portland\'s east-west dividing line. Burnside Street separates north from south. The city\'s 200-foot-long blocks make them easy to walk, but you can also explore the downtown core and Nob Hill by MAX light rail, the Portland Streetcar, or TriMet buses. Closer to the downtown core are the Pearl District and Old Town/Chinatown. Both the Pearl District and Nob Hill have a plethora of restaurants, specialty shops, and nightspots.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Aside from being pedestrian-friendly through inviting sidewalk sights and sounds, you can also explore the entire downtown for free through TriMet\'s \"fareless square\" system. Fare is not required when boarding buses, MAX light-rail, or streetcars when traveling within this designated area. Just say \"fareless\" as you board, and be sure to get off before you pass into a fare zone; drivers really do take note of who is riding for free, and may ask you to get off.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Taking advantage of the Zipcar car-sharing service is also a great way to get around Portland when you want a vehicle without major expense. Obtaining membership is easy: sign up online to become a member (www.zipcar.com) based on a few simple guidelines; once you\'ve applied, it takes only a few days for approval. An individual annual membership fee is $50 and members have use of Zipcars in many other major U.S. cities.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Unlike a car rental agency, car-sharing vehicles are dispersed throughout the city rather than at a single location. Once your reservation is made, you go to your car\'s location and let yourself in without paperwork or extra charges. Rates start at $8 per hour or $56 per day, and are all-inclusive.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It\'s the largest Suzhou-style garden outside China, with a large lake, bridged and covered walkways, koi- and water lily-filled ponds, rocks, bamboo, statues, waterfalls, and courtyards. A team of 60 artisans and designers from China literally left no stone unturned—500 tons of stone were brought here from Suzhou—in their efforts to give the windows, roof tiles, gateways, including a \"moongate,\" and other architectural aspects of the Garden some specific meaning or purpose. Also on the premises are a gift shop and a two-story teahouse overlooking the lake and garden. www.portlandchinesegarden.org. COST: $7. OPEN: Nov.-Mar., daily 10-5; Apr.-Oct., daily 9-6. Tours daily at noon and 1. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Japanese Garden</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most authentic Japanese garden outside Japan is nestled among 5½ acres of Washington Park above the International Rose Test Garden. This serene spot, designed by a Japanese landscape master represents five separate garden styles: Strolling Pond Garden, Tea Garden, Natural Garden, Sand and Stone Garden, and Flat Garden. The Tea House was built in Japan and reconstructed here. The west side of the Pavilion has a majestic view of Portland and Mt. Hood. Take MAX light rail to Washington Park station and transfer to Bus No. 63. JUN 2007 www.japanesegarden.com. COST: $6.75.

It\'s so big it has its own map, and rooms are color-coded according to the types of books, so you can find your way out again. Be sure to espy the pillar bearing signatures of prominent sci-fi authors who have passed through the store—the scrawls are protected by a jagged length of Plexiglas. At the very least, stop into Powell\'s for a peek or grab a cup of coffee at the adjoining branch of World Cup Coffee. www.powells.com.

If winter road conditions worry you, consider traveling by train.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Great Itineraries</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With your own transportation, you can easily see many of the places outlined below on day trips from New York City. That said, you can get a better feel for the valley by taking to the open road over three days. Along the way you\'ll stop at a historic site, have a leisurely lunch, and watch the countryside glide past your windshield. You could spend a month exploring the Hudson Valley—the historic sites and mansions alone could easily consume a few weeks—but three days will give a good overview. A six-day stay allows you to spend more time exploring additional villages and combines tours of the area\'s many stately homes with outdoor time.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\'re driving, it\'s not difficult to combine explorations of the western Hudson Valley with excursions into the Catskills region. Woodstock, for instance, is just a few miles from Kingston and Saugerties.</div><br><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 1 Day</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Lower Hudson Valley is a great day-trip destination from New York City. You could spend the morning hiking in <b>Harriman &amp; Bear Mountain State Parks</b>,eat a picnic lunch, and then head for some pre-dinner shopping in either the Woodbury Common Premium Outlets or in <b>Nyack</b>,or center a trip on a visit to <b>West Point</b> or <b>Storm King</b>. On the east side of the Hudson River, you can head for <b>Tarrytown</b>,touring Kykuit or one of the other magnificent homes in the area and then treating yourself to dinner at Blue Hill at Stone Barns (reserve a month ahead) or another local spot. <b>Katonah</b> is a good option with or without kids. <b>Beacon</b> is a blend of cool art, old buildings, funky shops, and laid-back restaurants. <b>Cold Spring</b> is your best bet if you\'re traveling by train; if the shops and eateries don\'t interest you, take a hike—in Hudson Highlands State Park, that is.</div><br><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With just three days, it\'s best to concentrate on one or two areas and to avoid repeatedly crisscrossing the Hudson River. Make <b>Hyde Park</b> your first stop and tour Franklin D. Roosevelt\'s home and/or the Vanderbilt Mansion. If you\'re here on a Friday or Saturday, have dinner at one of the Culinary Institute of America restaurants before continuing on to <b>New Paltz</b>,the <b>High Falls</b> area, <b>Kingston</b>,<b>Millbrook</b>,or <b>Rhinebeck</b>,where you\'ll spend the next two nights. (If it\'s not Friday or Saturday, eat in whichever town you end up overnighting in.)</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\'re staying on the west side of the Hudson River, spend Day 2 exploring the sights and other diversions in your base village. From Kingston you can take a cruise on the Hudson River (May through October) and float past several historic mansions. On Day 3, head for the great outdoors—the Minnewaska State Park Preserve or the Mohonk Preserve, specifically—and go walking, hiking, biking, rock climbing, or cross-country skiing.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\'re staying in Rhinebeck, visit <b>Staatsburg</b>,<b>Annandale-on-Hudson &amp; Tivoli</b>,or <b>Hudson</b> on Day 2. The stately beaux-arts mansion at the Staatsburg State Historic Site; Bard\'s Frank Gehry-designed performing-arts center; the stunning gardens and classical revival-style mansion of Montgomery Place; and Frederic Church\'s Moorish-style home, Olana, are all highlights. If you\'re staying in Millbrook, check out a winery and one of the gardens. On Day 3, spend time strolling and shopping in either village.</div><br><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 6 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Follow Day 1 of the three-day itinerary above and choose a base on either the west or east side of the Hudson. On the second and third days, follow the suggestions given in the above itinerary for this area. At the end of Day 3, head to a new base on the opposite side of the river. On the fourth and fifth days, follow the suggestions given in the three-day itinerary.

The collection includes a reproduction of Charles Lindbergh\'s <i>Spirit of St. Lewis</i> and fighter planes from World War I. For a thrill you can don a Snoopy-style cap and goggles and soar over the area in an open-cockpit biplane.

Lake Minnewaska is its jewel; the park also includes Awosting Lake. A network of historic carriageways, now used by hikers, mountain bikers, horseback riders, and cross-country skiers, and other trails veins the land. Swimming is restricted to designated areas; scuba divers must be certified. Boating is allowed with a permit. Nature programs include walks and talks.

Walk across the Charles Bridge at dawn and take in the dramatic city skyline.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">2. Have a drink at any authentic <i>hospoda</i>, or pub.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">3. Hike down from the Strahov Monastery to Malá Strana, taking in the view.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">4. Get lost in the Old Town. Stow your map at the hotel and wander the labyrinth of little cobblestone alleyways.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">5. Stroll the river on the Malá Strana side while feeding the swans.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Like</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">One-of-a-Kind Castles</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Czech Republic is a veritable compendium of architectural styles. Having emerged from World War II relatively unscathed, it is blessed with intact buildings representing almost every prewar period from Romanesque to cubist. The remarkable range inevitably draws stares. And newer additions—including Frank Gehry\'s bizarrely bent Dancing House (the Tancící dum)—are equally impressive. Nevertheless, it is those grand Czech castles, manor houses, and châteaux that truly capture the collective imagination. More than 2,000 of them are scattered around the country, forming a precious, not-to-be-missed part of the cultural and historical landscape. Some may be little more than grim ruins that glower from craggy hilltops. But many have been restored, either by private owners or the state, and an increasing number are now open to the public.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Prazský Hrad (Prague Castle)—a symbol of the Czech capital for more than a millennium—shelters a Romanesque basilica, a Gothic cathedral, a Renaissance garden, and a baroque palace within its imposing walls.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With its tall rounded tower and gently arched arcades, Hrad Krumlov (Krumlov Castle) complements the fairy-tale look of the town below. Black bears romping in the castle\'s moat further animate the fanciful tableau.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Zámek Konopiste (Konopiste Castle) is an easy drive from Prague. The former residence of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, this castle is packed with paintings, statues, and a compulsive collection of hunting trophies.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Unique Souvenirs</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To see how thoroughly capitalism has trounced communism in the Czech Republic, visitors need only stroll down Prague\'s Parízská Street: an elegant tree-edged boulevard that is home to Hermès, Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, and more. But let\'s be honest. You\'re not going to take a trans-Atlantic flight just to shop at a high-end, high-priced international retailer. So it makes sense to stock up instead on more distinctive indigenous items. Bohemia, for instance, is synonymous with fine crystal—which appeals to decorators with well-padded wallets. It is also known for the superlative quality of its locally mined garnets. If you\'re on a budget, tempting craft stores and low-cost markets are another option. They often sell wooden toys, hand-painted porcelain, intricate lacework, and folksy mementos like decorative <i>kraslice</i> eggs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For traditional crystal, it\'s hard to beat Moser: a Karlovy Vary glassmaker with six stores nationwide. Prefer something more modern? Function coupled with contemporary form make Artel in Staré Mesto a Fodor\'s Choice.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Miners work hard to find those blood-red garnets—but you won\'t have to. Ceský Granát, which sells the genuine article at reasonable prices, is conveniently located in the warren of shops around Old Town Square.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If your Czech list includes kids, you can\'t leave Prague without a marionette. Because they are so ubiquitous, the hardest part of making a purchase will be choosing between that milkmaid figure and the wooden mini Mozart.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fine Dining</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Not so long ago a foray into the Czech Republic meant enjoying the sights in spite of the indifferent food. As a solidly meat-and-potatoes country, its standard menus consisted of little more than pork knuckle or saucy beef, and the culinary rallying cry seemed to be \"make way for dumplings!\" But today new chefs are reinvigorating old combinations and introducing eager diners to fusion flavors. The result is that Prague now boasts the first restaurant in the former Soviet Bloc to earn a coveted Michelin star. More may well be on the way, and if restaurants keep improving at their present pace, it won\'t be long before globe-trotting gourmets fly in specifically for the food. Be prepared, though. This epicurean revolution doesn\'t come cheap. Prices at the best places can easily meet or exceed those of their counterparts in Western Europe and North America.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Even before winning its Michelin star, Allegro (in the Four Seasons hotel) was a worthy splurge. The credit rightfully goes to expatriate chef Andrea Accordi, who marries the best of Italian and Central European cooking.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay proves that he, too, is a contender at maze. Opened at the end of 2007 in the Hilton Old Town hotel, this Prague outpost of his acclaimed London eatery embodies Ramsay\'s signature style.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Foodies and A-listers both flock to Kampa Park. The sensory assault begins with a view of the Charles Bridge and continues right through dinner, thanks to Marek Raditsch\'s artful preparation of seasonal ingredients.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Good Libations</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The king of beers in this part of the world is not Budweiser—though Czech Budvar runs a close second—but rather Plzenský Prazdroj (aka Pilsner Urquell), the world-renowned pale lager that was invented here in 1842. Other beers to quaff include slightly bitter Krusovice, fruity Radegast, and the bolder Staropramen. Czechs, of course, also produce tasty wines, most notably in southern Moravia, where the soil is rich and the summers are comparatively warm. Favorite white varietals are Müller-Thurgau, with a muscat bouquet and light flavor, and Neuburské, yellow-green in color with a dry, smoky scent. Rulandské bílé, a semidry burgundy-like white, has a flowery bouquet and full-bodied flavor. As for reds, Frankovka runs to fiery and slightly acidic, whereas cherry-red Rulandské cervené is a drier alternative.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Within the city itself, beer lovers can sign on for an hour-long tour at the Staropramen Brewery visitor center in the Smíchov district. It begins with a film on Bohemian brewing and ends (hurray!) with a tasting.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Wine connoisseurs, meanwhile, can suss out Moravia\'s best around the towns of Mikulov and Valtice where vineyards, hillside wine cellars, and sundry <i>vino</i>-oriented events make an intoxicating mix.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The word <i>prazdroj</i> translates as \"source\", and you can discover the source of Plzenský Prazdroj by visiting the legendary brewery and brewery-themed museum in Plzen, 55 mi west of Prague. Bottoms up!</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Quintessential</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pivo (Beer)</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Every discussion about the Czech Republic begins and ends with beer. After all, not only are Czechs the world\'s largest per capita consumers of beer, but they also invented modern pilsner (it\'s named after the town Plzen), and their beer is considered to be the world\'s best. It\'s so good, in fact, that beer here commands the type of reverence usually reserved for fine wine. But if you really want to drink it like a native, don\'t chug it from a bottle or a can. Head to the nearest <i>pivnice</i>, or pub, find a seat at a table, wipe the inevitable cigarette ash off the tablecloth, and wait for the waiter to plunk down a mug in front of you. Turn to your neighbor, raise your glass, and say, <i>Na zdraví,</i>\"To your health!\" (any pronunciation will work). Congratulations. You\'re now an honorary citizen.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Culture</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Czechs in general are culture vultures, and the performing arts are hugely popular. Opera and orchestral music are the biggest draws, and you\'ll see touts advertising quick \"greatest hits\"-style concerts in churches all over town. But these are targeted squarely at tourists, with nary a local in sight. So save your koruna for the real deal, like a performance by the Prague State Opera or the Czech Philharmonic. (FYI: the Estates Theatre and Rudolfinum are particularly good venues for anyone who cares as much about architecture as acoustics.) The weekly <i>Prague Post</i> carries a full listing of classical acts plus rock concerts and club shows aimed at Czechs where language is not likely to be a problem. The quality of the performances is high, and the audience reaction is always heartfelt.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Holidays</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Praguers love a holiday, and it seems that any one—official or otherwise—will suffice. Not content, for example, to usher in spring with painted eggs and birch boughs at Easter time, they also insist on pitching themselves over bonfires on Witches\' Night (April 30) in an end-of-winter rite that dates back to pagan days. The biggest bash, though, is reserved for Christmas. It starts four Saturdays before Christmas Eve, when seasonal markets open in local squares, then kicks into high gear on December 5, when St. Nicholas appears to separate the naughty children from the nice. If you really want to get into the spirit of things, services are also held in the two city churches dedicated to St. Nick: one is an 18th-century edifice on Old Town Square, and the other dominates Malá Strana.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parks</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Like many city dwellers, residents of Prague are inordinately fond of their public green spaces, which serve as a sort of communal backyard. Formal gardens—like Vrtba in Malá Strana—offer a grassy respite. Parks are better still, two of the most popular being Letná and Riegrovy Sady. Aside from walking shoes (or Rollerblades if you have them), you should follow the Praguers\' lead by coming equipped with a book, blanket, and picnic. Since both parks have huge beer gardens, you should be prepared to stay awhile, too. Prefer a walk on the wild side? At Divoká Sárka (literally \"Wild Sarka\"), open fields, wooded paths, and a stream-fed pool lure nature lovers, and Petrínské Sady, on Prague\'s highest hill, appeals to the upwardly mobile.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">On the Menu</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Traditional Czech food is hearty, with big portions of meat and something starchy on the side, such as dumplings or potatoes. Herbs and spices are not used heavily, though dill, marjoram, and caraway make frequent appearances, and garlic is a mainstay. Aside from these, the flavor comes from the meat. The Czechs know what they\'re doing when it comes to smoking meat—the natural way—and smoked <i>uzený</i> (pork) makes its way into many meals.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Bramborák</b> (<i>bram</i>-bohr-ahk). Available from fast-food stands throughout the city as well as in restaurants, this large (6- to 8-inch) potato pancake is flavored with marjoram and deep-fried.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Bezmasá jídla.</b> This section of the menu lists dishes without meat. Listings often include <i>cocka</i> (stewed lentils), <i>smazený sýr</i> (fried cheese), and <i>rizoto se zeleninou</i> (risotto with vegetables).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Cesnecka</b> (<i>ches</i>-netch-kah). A Czech standby, this garlic soup is a thin—usually meatless—garlic-laced broth containing small pieces of potato, served with fried bread cubes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Cocky</b> (<i>choch</i>-kee). In this traditional dish, green lentils are stewed with or without smoked meat. An egg and pickle are usually served with the meatless version.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Cibulacka</b> (<i>tsi</i>-boo-latch-kah). A close relative of cesnecka—though a little less potent—this onion soup is usually served with bread, and cheese is sprinkled on top. Unlike the French version, it\'s not made from meat broth, so it\'s usually quite light.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Dábelské toasty</b> (<i>dya</i>-bel-skeh). Devil\'s toasts are a mixture of cooked ground beef, tomatoes, onions, and peppers served on fried or toasted white bread.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Gulás</b> (<i>goo</i>-laush). Less oily than its Hungarian counterpart, Czech goulash is cubes of beef or pork, stewed and served in thin gravy. It\'s usually served with <i>houskové knedlíky</i> (bread dumplings) and chopped onions on top.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Hotová jídla</b> (<i>ho</i>-to-vah <i>yee</i>\'dla). This section of the menu contains dishes that are premade and ready to be served. Listed here you can find the most traditional favorites <i>svíckova</i> (stewed beef) and goulash.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Jídla na objednávku</b> (<i>yee</i>\'dla na <i>ob</i>-yeh\'d-nahv-koo). This section of the menu lists dishes that are cooked to order, including a selection of chicken and pork cutlets, as well as beefsteak, prepared in various ways. Usually, they differ in their use of ingredients, such as onions, garlic, mushrooms, or cheese.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Klobása</b> (kloh-<i>bah</i>-sa). A mainstay of the <i>obcerstveni</i> (fast-food stand), this smoked sausage is also served in restaurants as an addition to certain types of gulás and soups or by itself.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Kulajda</b> (koo-<i>lie</i>-dah). This traditional creamy soup with fresh or dried forest mushrooms is flavored with wine vinegar, caraway, and dill.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Moucníky</b> (<i>moe</i>-ooch-<i>nik</i>kee). The dessert section on any traditional Czech menu is not terribly long, but you might see <i>palacinky</i> (sweet pancakes), <i>zmrzlina</i> (ice cream), <i>compot</i> (fruit compote), or <i>dort</i> (cake).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Nakládaný Hermelín</b> (<i>nah</i>-kla-den-ee). A favorite snack of cafés and pubs that consists of a small round of <i>hermelín</i> (a soft cheese closely resembling Camembert) pickled in oil, onions, and herbs and served with dark rye bread.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Palacinky</b> (pala-<i>ching</i>-kee). Usually served with jam or ice cream inside and whipped cream on top, these pancakes resemble crepes, but are made with a thicker batter.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Prílohy</b> (<i>pr\'zhee</i>-lo-hee). In traditional Czech restaurants side orders aren\'t included with main courses, so look for them in this menu section. Regular dishes include <i>hranolky</i> (french fries), <i>Americké brambory</i> (literally, American potatoes; actually, fried potato wedges), and <i>ryze</i> (rice).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Smazený sýr</b> (<i>sma</i>-zhe-nee <i>see</i>\'r). A postwar addition to the traditional Czech diet, this staple is literally translated as \"fried cheese.\" A thick slab of an Edamlike cheese is breaded and deep fried, ideally giving it a crusty shell and a warm gooey interior. It\'s usually served with tartar sauce—for liberally spreading on top—and fries.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Studené predkrmy</b> (<i>stoo</i>-den-eh <i>pr\'zhed</i>-krmy). The section of cold appetizers on a Czech menu is typically a short one and usually includes <i>utopenec</i> (pickled pork sandwich), <i>tlacenka</i> (head cheese), and <i>sunkova rolka</i> (ham roll with horseradish cream).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Svícková</b> (<i>svitch</i>-koh-vah). Though technically this means a tenderloin cut of beef, on menus it\'s actually a dish consisting of two to four slabs of stewed beef, usually rump roast; in better restaurants you can get real tenderloin covered with a creamy sauce of pureed root vegetables, garnished with a dollop of whipping cream, cranberry sauce, and a slice of lemon. It\'s served with <i>houskové knedlíky</i> (bread dumplings).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Teplé predkrmy</b> (<i>teh</i>-pleh <i>pr</i>\'zhed-kr-mee). Warm appetizers on a Czech menu ordinarily include <i>topinka</i> (toasted or fried dark bread, rubbed with garlic cloves) and <i>dabelské toasty</i> (devil\'s toasts).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Utopenec</b> (<i>oo</i>-toe-pen-etts). Literally translated as \"drowned man,\" utopenec is uncooked pork sausage that has been pickled in vinegar. It\'s not only a common appetizer in Czech restaurants, but a ubiquitous beer-snack staple in Czech pubs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Vepro-knedlo-zelo</b> (<i>veh</i>-pr\'zho-<i>kne</i>\'dlo-<i>zhe</i>-lo). An affectionately shortened name for the three foods that appear on one plate, this popular family dish consists of roast pork, dumplings, and cabbage stewed with a bit of caraway.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Zelnacka</b> (zell-<i>n\'yatch</i>-kah). Cabbage is the main ingredient in this hearty soup whose flavor is accentuated by caraway and smoked pork or sausage. It can be a filling meal by itself when served in a small round loaf of bread.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

INSERT INTO `tbwgtext` VALUES (1643,'<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Obecní dum</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city\'s art nouveau showpiece still fills the role it had when it was completed in 1911 as a center for concerts, rotating art exhibits, and café society. The mature art nouveau style echoes the lengths the Czech middle class went to at the turn of the 20th century to imitate Paris. Much of the interior bears the work of Alfons Mucha, Max Svabinský, and other leading Czech artists. Mucha decorated the Hall of the Lord Mayor upstairs with impressive, magical frescoes depicting Czech history; unfortunately it\'s visible only as part of a guided tour. The beautiful <b>Smetanova sín</b> (Smetana Hall), which hosts concerts by the Prague Symphony Orchestra as well as international players, is on the second floor. The ground-floor restaurants are overcrowded with tourists but still impressive, with glimmering chandeliers and exquisite woodwork. There\'s also a beer hall in the cellar, with decent food and ceramic murals on the walls. www.obecnidum.cz. OPEN: Information center and box office daily 10-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bazilika svatého Jirí</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Inside, this church looks more or less as it did in the 12th century; it\'s the best-preserved Romanesque relic in the country. The effect is at once barnlike and peaceful, as the warm golden yellow of the stone walls and the small arched windows exude a sense of enduring harmony. Prince Vratislav I originally built it in the 10th century, though only the foundations remain from that time. The father of Prince Wenceslas (of Christmas carol fame) dedicated it to St. George (of dragon fame), a figure supposedly more agreeable to the still largely pagan people. The outside was remodeled during early baroque times, although the striking rusty-red color is in keeping with the look of the Romanesque edifice. The painted, house-shape tomb at the front of the church holds the remains of Vratislav. Up the steps, in a chapel to the right, is the tomb Peter Parler designed for St. Ludmila, grandmother of St. Wenceslas. www.hrad.cz. COST: Included in 2-day castle ticket (250-350 Kc). OPEN: Tues.—Sun. 10-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chrám svatého Mikuláse</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With dynamic curves, this church is one of the purest and most ambitious examples of high baroque. The celebrated architect Christoph Dientzenhofer began the Jesuit church in 1704 on the site of one of the more active Hussite churches of 15th-century Prague. Work on the building was taken over by his son Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer, who built the dome and presbytery. Anselmo Lurago completed the whole thing in 1755 by adding the bell tower. The juxtaposition of the broad, full-bodied dome with the slender bell tower is one of the many striking architectural contrasts that mark the Prague skyline. Inside, the vast pink-and-green space is impossible to take in with a single glance. Every corner bristles with life, guiding the eye first to the dramatic statues, then to the hectic frescoes, and on to the shining faux-marble pillars. Many of the statues are the work of Ignaz Platzer; they constitute his last blaze of success. Platzer\'s workshop was forced to declare bankruptcy when the centralizing and secularizing reforms of Joseph II toward the end of the 18th century brought an end to the flamboyant baroque era. The tower, with an entrance on the side of the church, is open in summer. The church also hosts chamber music concerts in summer, which complement this eye-popping setting but do not reflect the true caliber of classical music in Prague. For that, check the schedule posted across the street at <b>Líchtenský palác,</b> where the faculty of HAMU, the city\'s premier music academy, often give performances. COST: 60 Kc. OPEN: Daily 9-4:30 for sightseeing, 8:30-9AMfor prayer; no admission charge for prayer. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chrám svatého Víta</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With its graceful, soaring towers, this Gothic cathedral—among the most beautiful in Europe—is the spiritual heart of Prague Castle and of the Czech Republic itself. The cathedral has a long and complicated history, beginning in the 10th century and continuing to its completion in 1929. To hear its history in depth, English-speaking guided tours of the cathedral and the Královský palác can be arranged at the information office across from the cathedral entrance.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once you enter the cathedral, pause to take in the vast but delicate beauty of the Gothic and neo-Gothic interior. Colorful light filters through the brilliant stained-glass windows. This western third of the structure, including the façade and the two towers you can see from outside, was not completed until 1929, following the initiative of the Union for the Completion of the Cathedral. Don\'t let the neo-Gothic illusion keep you from examining this new section. The six stained-glass windows to your left and right and the large rose window behind are modern masterpieces. Take a good look at the third window up on the left. The familiar art nouveau flamboyance, depicting the blessing of Sts. Cyril and Methodius (9th-century missionaries to the Slavs), is the work of Alfons Mucha, the Czech founder of the style. He achieved the subtle coloring by painting rather than staining the glass.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Walking halfway up the right-hand aisle, you will find the <b>Svatováclavská kaple</b> (Chapel of St. Wenceslas). With a tomb holding the saint\'s remains, walls covered in semi-precious stones, and paintings depicting the life of Wenceslas, this square chapel is the ancient core of the cathedral. Stylistically, it represents a high point of the dense, richly decorated—though rather gloomy—Gothic favored by Charles IV and his successors. Wenceslas (the \"good king\" of Christmas-carol fame) was a determined Christian in an era of widespread paganism. Around 925, as prince of Bohemia, he founded a rotunda church dedicated to St. Vitus on this site. But the prince\'s brother, Boleslav, was impatient to take power, and he ambushed and killed Wenceslas in 935 near a church at Stará Boleslav, northeast of Prague. Wenceslas was originally buried in that church, but so many miracles happened at his grave that he rapidly became a symbol of piety for the common people, something that greatly irritated the new Prince Boleslav. Boleslav was finally forced to honor his brother by reburying the body in the St. Vitus Rotunda. Shortly afterward, Wenceslas was canonized.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The rotunda was replaced by a Romanesque basilica in the late 11th century. Work began on the existing building in 1344. For the first few years the chief architect was the Frenchman Mathias d\'Arras, but after his death in 1352 the work continued under the direction of 22-year-old German architect Peter Parler, who went on to build the Charles Bridge and many other Prague treasures.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The small door in the back of the chapel leads to the <b>Korunní komora</b> (Crown Chamber), the Bohemian crown jewels\' repository. It remains locked with seven keys held by seven important people (including the president) and rarely opens to the public.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A little beyond the Chapel of St. Wenceslas on the same side, stairs lead down to the underground <b>royal crypt,</b> interesting primarily for the information it provides about the cathedral\'s history. As you descend the stairs, you can see parts of the old Romanesque basilica and portions of the foundations of the rotunda. Moving into the second room, you find a rather eclectic group of royal remains ensconced in sarcophagi dating from the 1930s. In the center is Charles IV, who died in 1378. Rudolf II, patron of Renaissance Prague, is entombed at the rear in his original tin coffin. To his right is Maria Amalia, the only child of Empress Maria Theresa to reside in Prague. Ascending the wooden steps back into the cathedral brings you to the white-marble <b>Kralovské mausoleum</b> (Royal Mausoleum), atop which lie stone statues of the first two Hapsburg kings to rule in Bohemia, Ferdinand I and Maximilian II, and another of Ferdinand\'s consort, Anne Jagiello.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The cathedral\'s <b>Kralovské oratorium</b> (Royal Oratory) was used by the kings and their families when attending mass. Built in 1493, the work represents a perfect example of late Gothic. It\'s laced on the outside with a stone network of gnarled branches, similar in pattern to the ceiling vaulting in the Královský palác. The oratory connects to the palace by an elevated covered walkway, which you can see from outside.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A few more steps toward the east end, you can\'t fail to catch sight of the ornate silver <b>sarcophagus of St. John of Nepomuk.</b> According to legend, when Nepomuk\'s body was exhumed in 1721 to be reinterred, the tongue was found to be still intact and pumping with blood. This strange tale served a highly political purpose: the Catholic Church and the Hapsburgs were seeking a new folk hero to replace the Protestant forerunner Jan Hus, whom they despised. The 14th-century priest Nepomuk, killed during a power struggle with King Václav IV, was sainted and reburied a few years later with great ceremony in a 3,700-pound silver tomb, replete with angels and cherubim; the tongue was enshrined in its own reliquary.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The eight chapels around the back of the cathedral are the work of the original architect, Mathias d\'Arras. A number of old tombstones, including some badly worn grave markers of medieval royalty, can be seen within, amid furnishings from later periods. Opposite the wooden relief, depicting the Protestants looting of the cathedral in 1619, is the <b>Valdstejnská kaple</b> (Wallenstein Chapel). Since the 19th century the chapel has housed the Gothic tombstones of its two architects, d\'Arras and Peter Parler, who died in 1352 and 1399, respectively. If you look up to the balcony, you can just make out the busts of these two men, designed by Parler\'s workshop. The other busts around the triforium depict royalty and other VIPs of the time.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Hussite wars in the 15th century put an end to the first phase of the cathedral\'s construction. During the short era of illusory peace before the Thirty Years\' War, the massive south tower was completed, but lack of money quashed any idea of finishing the building, and the cathedral was closed in by a wall built across from the Chapel of St. Wenceslas. Not until the 20th century was the western side of the cathedral, with its two towers, completed in the spirit of Parler\'s conception.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A key element of the cathedral\'s teeming, rich exterior decoration is the <b>Last Judgment mosaic</b> above the ceremonial entrance, called the Golden Portal, on the south side. The use of mosaic is quite rare in countries north of the Alps; this work, constructed from 1 million glass and stone chunks, dates from the 1370s. The once-clouded glass now sparkles again thanks to many years of restoration funded by the Getty Conservation Institute.

Originally laid out in the 16th century, it endured devastation in war, neglect in times of peace, and many redesigns, reaching its present parklike form early in the 20th century. Luckily, its Renaissance treasures survived. One of these is the long, narrow <b>Mícovna</b> (Ball Game Hall), built by Bonifaz Wohlmut in 1568, its garden front completely covered by a dense tangle of allegorical <i>sgraffiti.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Královský letohrádek</b> (Royal Summer Palace, also known as the Belvedere), at the garden\'s eastern end, deserves its unusual reputation as one of the most beautiful Renaissance structures north of the Alps. Italian architects began it; Wohlmut finished it off in the 1560s with a copper roof like an upturned boat\'s keel riding above the graceful arcades of the ground floor. During the 18th and 19th centuries military engineers tested artillery in the interior, which had already lost its rich furnishings to Swedish soldiers during their siege of the city in 1648. The Renaissance-style <i>giardinetto</i> (little garden) adjoining the summer palace centers on another masterwork, the Italian-designed, Czech-produced Singing Fountain, which resonates from the sound of falling water. www.hrad.cz. OPEN: Apr.-Oct., daily 10-5:45. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lobkovický palác</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Greatly benefiting from a recent renovation, this palace is a showcase for baroque and rococo styling. Exhibits trace the ancestry of the Lobkowicz family, who were great patrons of the arts in their heyday. (Beethoven was one of the artists who received their funding.) The audio tour adds a personal touch: it\'s narrated by William Lobwicz, the family scion who spearheaded the property\'s restitution and rehabilitation, and includes quite a few anecdotes about the family through the years. Although inside Prague Castle, this museum has a separate admission. www.lobkowiczevents.cz. COST: 275 Kc. OPEN: Daily 10-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Národní divadlo</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Statues representing Drama and Opera rise above the riverfront side entrances to this theater, and two gigantic chariots flank figures of Apollo and the nine Muses above the main façade. The performance space lacks restraint as well—it\'s filled with gilding, voluptuous plaster figures, and plush upholstery. The idea for a Czech national theater began during the revolutionary decade of the 1840s. In a telling display of national pride, donations to fund the plan poured in from all over the country, from people of every socioeconomic stratum. The cornerstone was laid in 1868, and the \"National Theater generation\" who built the neo-Renaissance structure became the architectural and artistic establishment for decades to come. Its designer, Josef Zítek, was the leading neo-Renaissance architect in Bohemia. The nearly finished interior was gutted by a fire in 1881, and Zítek\'s onetime student Josef Schulz saw the reconstruction through to completion two years later. Today it\'s still the country\'s leading dramatic stage. www.narodni-divadlo.cz.

Start with a day and a night in <b>Park City,</b> skiing one of its three resorts in winter or taking advantage of lift-served mountain biking in summer, then enjoying a night out on historic Main Street. The next day drive west on I-80, south along Salt Lake City\'s eastern bench on I-215, and east again on Route 210 up <b>Little Cottonwood Canyon.</b> In winter spend a day skiing at Alta or Snowbird. In summer hike the Catherine Pass trail into neighboring <b>Big Cottonwood Canyon.</b> On your final day head south again on I-15, then east on Route 92 on the Alpine Loop scenic drive to <b>Sundance Resort</b>, where you can pamper yourself with a massage at the Spa and a quiet meal at the Tree Room or the Foundry Grill. In winter the Alpine Loop will be closed to traffic, so instead of driving east on Route 92 continue south on I-15 and spend some time exploring <b>Provo</b> before driving east on U.S. 189 to Sundance.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 5 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Start your five-day trip by following the suggested three-day itinerary above and then tack on the following: on Day 4 leave Sundance, heading east on Route 189 up Provo Canyon to the <b>Heber Valley</b>. In winter spend the day cross-country skiing or snowshoeing before your late-afternoon sleigh ride, and in summer go hiking, golfing, or horseback riding in Wasatch Mountain State Park. The point is to take in the beauty of the Wasatch at a slower pace than downhill skiing or snowboarding allows. Treat yourself to supper at Snake Creek Grill before retiring to the overnight comforts of the Homestead Resort. Strike out on Day 5 using River Road to connect to U.S. 40 and back to <b>Park City</b> where, even though you started your trip here, something new awaits. Ski and/or snowboard until you\'re worn out and then nestle into an après-ski lounge for a hot toddy before suppertime and your pre-sleep hot tub. In warmer months spend your day fly-fishing with one of the guides from Trout Bum 2 or hiking some of Park City\'s extensive trail system and cap it off with supper on the patio of one of Park City\'s fine restaurants.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 7 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In a week you can get a good feel for the diversity of the Wasatch. Follow the five-day itinerary above, adding a day and a night in <b>Big Cottonwood Canyon</b> between Park City and Little Cottonwood Canyon. Then you can spend an extra day and night either exploring the <b>Heber Valley</b> or <b>Park City</b>.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

In summer, check out the freestyle ski jumpers doing flips and spins into a splash pool and Nordic jumpers soaring to soft landings on a synthetic outrun. Ride one of two zip lines—the extreme version parallels the K-120 jump—or zoom down the steel track of the Quicksliver Alpine Slide. There\'s also an interactive ski museum and an exhibit on the 2002 Winter Olympics; guided tours are offered year-round, or you can take a self-guided tour. www.olyparks.com.

In concept and practice, the 5,000-acre mountain community reflects Redford\'s commitment to the natural environment, outdoor exploration, and artistic expression. All resort facilities—constructed from local materials such as indigenous cedar, fir, and pine, and locally quarried stone—blend well with the natural landscape. No matter the season, you\'ll find plenty of recreational opportunities including hiking, biking, fly-fishing, horseback riding, alpine and cross-country skiing, snowboarding, and snowshoeing. If you\'re looking for a more indulgent experience, relax with a body treatment in The Spa at Sundance or take one of many creative classes at The Art Shack. The Sundance Film Festival, based in nearby Park City each January, is an internationally recognized showcase for independent films. Festival screenings and summer workshops are held at the resort. www.sundanceresort.com.

Blue sky above, ribbons of river below, and in between: a forest of treetops and a healthy shot of adrenaline.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Water Sports</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend a day on the bay. Dive the varied landscape of Las Marietas Islands, angle for billfish, or take a boat ride for the fun of it. Look for orcas or humpbacks in winter and dolphins year-round. Swim, snorkel, or learn to surf or sail. Perhaps just build a sand castle with your kids.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dining Out</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">First-time travelers come for the sun and sea, but it\'s PV\'s wonderful restaurants that create long-term fans. Dozens of top toques have restaurants here, and each November sees the International Gourmet Festival with guest chefs, recipes, and ideas from around the globe. Seaside family-owned eateries grill fish right off the boat, and tiny city cafés have great eats at bargain prices. And a number of street-side stalls are as hygienic as five-star-hotel restaurants.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Late Nights, Latino Style</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Much of Vallarta is geared to the gringo palate, however, there\'s plenty of authentic spice for those who crave it. Enjoy a mojito at La Bodeguita del Medio, on the malecón. Dine on roast pork, black beans, and fried plantains before heading for the dance floor at around 9, when the house band comes to life. Thursday and Friday, take a taxi to J.B. Dance Club, in the hotel zone, for $4 dance lessons at 8 to 10 PM. Otherwise hang at La Bodeguita until around 11, when the Latino crowds start to arrive at J.B. for a late night of cumbia, salsa, and merengue.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sensational Sunsets</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After a day of activity, you deserve R, R, and R: rest, relaxation, and rewarding views. Sip a fancy cocktail to live music at busy Los Muertos Beach or indulge in dessert from the crow\'s nest at Bucerías\'s The Bar Above. For dramatic views from high above the sea head to Barcelona Tapas, Vista Guayabitos, or Las Carmelitas. All serve dinner and drinks.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hilltop Retreats</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Get away from the gringo trail 4,000 feet above sea level in the mountain towns east of PV. Admire the elegant simplicity of tiny San Sebastian; in Talpa, visit the diminutive Virgin of Talpa statue, revered throughout Mexico for petitions granted. Buy keepsakes and mountain-grown coffee in shops on the square. Road access is relatively easy, but you can still charter a plane to these towns or to Mascota, where you can sample homemade <i>raicilla</i>—second cousin of tequila. Hike into tapestry hills and deep green valleys where, on a good day, you can spy PV and a ribbon of the Pacific. For an unforgettable experience (at least until your thigh muscles recover), take a horseback expedition into forests. Rancho Charro and Rancho Ojo de Agua have full-day excursions; the former offers multiday excursions as well, including tours to the former silver-mining towns of Mascota and San Sebastián. For those who prefer motorized horsepower, Wild Vallarta runs full-day ATV tours to San Sebastián.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Snapshot of Puerto Vallarta</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Geography</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Puerto Vallarta sits at the center point of C-shape Banderas Bay. Spurs from the Sierra Cacoma run down to the sea, forming a landscape of numerous valleys. This highly fractured mountain range is just one of many within the Sierra Madre—which runs from the Rockies to South America. Sierra Cacoma sits at the juncture of several major systems that head south toward Oaxaca State. Forming a distinct but related system is the volcanic or transversal volcanic axis that runs east to west across the country—and the globe. Comprising part of the so-called Ring of Fire, this transverse chain includes some of the world\'s most active volcanoes. Volcán de Fuego, southeast of Puerto Vallarta in Colima State, and the giant Popocateptl, near the Gulf of Mexico, are active. Visible from PV are the more intimate Sierra Vallejo and the Sierra Cuale ranges, to the north and south respectively.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Heading down to the sea from these highlands are a number of important rivers, including the Ameca and the Mascota, which join forces not far from the coast at a place called Las Juntas (The Joining). The Ameca is a large river whose mouth forms the boundary between Jalisco and Nayarit states. The Cuale River empties into the ocean at Puerto Vallarta, dividing the city center in two. In addition to many rivers the area is blessed with seasonal and permanent streams and springs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Banderas Bay, or Bahía de Banderas, is Mexico\'s largest bay, at 42 km (26 mi) tip to tip. The northern point, Punta Mita, is in Nayarit State. Towns at the southern extreme of the bay, at Cabo Corrientes (Cape Currents)—named for the frequently strong currents off its shore—are accessible only by boat or dirt roads. The mountains backing the Costalegre are part of the Sierra Madre Occidental range. The hilly region of eroded plains has two main river systems: the San Nicolás and Cuitzmala.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Several hundred miles east of Banderas Bay, Guadalajara—capital of Jalisco State—occupies the west end of 5,400-foot Atemajac Valley, which is surrounded by mountains. Just south of Guadalajara, Lake Chapala is Mexico\'s largest natural lake.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Flora</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The western flanks of the Sierra Madre and foothills leading down to the sea have tropical deciduous forest. At the higher levels are expanses of pine-oak forest. Many species of pines thrive in these woods, mixed in with <i>encinos</i> and <i>robles,</i> two different categories of oak. Walnut trees and <i>oyamel,</i> a type of fir, are the mainstays of the lower <i>arroyos,</i> or river basins.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Along the coast magnificent <i>huanacaxtle,</i> also called <i>parota</i> (in English, monkey pod or elephant ear tree), mingle with equally huge and impressive mango as well as kapok, cedar, tropical almond, tamarind, flamboyant, and willow. The brazilwood tree is resistant to insects, and, therefore, ideal for making furniture. <i>Matapalo,</i> or strangler fig, are common in this landscape. As its name hints, these fast-growing trees embrace others in a death grip; once the matopalo is established, the host tree eventually dies.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Colima palms, known locally as <i>guaycoyul,</i> produce small round nuts smashed for oil or sometimes fed to domestic animals. Mango, avocado, citrus, and guava are found in the wild. Imported trees and bushes often seen surrounding homes and small farms include Indian laurel, bamboo, and bougainvillea.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The coastal fringe north of San Blas is surprisingly characterized by savannas. Guinea grass makes fine animal fodder for horses and cows. Lanky coconut trees line roads and beaches. The watery \"milk\" is a refreshing drink, and the meat of the coconut, although high in saturated fat, can be eaten or used in many types of candy. Another drink, <i>agua de tuba,</i> is made from the heart of the palm; the trunk is used in certain types of construction. Mangroves in saltwater estuaries provide an ecosystem for crabs, crustaceans, and birds.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">South of Banderas Bay, thorn forest predominates along the coastal strip, backed by tropical deciduous forest. Leguminous trees like the <i>tabachin,</i> with its bright orange flowers, have long, dangling seedpods used by indigenous people as rattles. Other prominent area residents are the acacias, hardy trees with fluffy puffballs of light yellow blooms. The dry forest is home to more than 1,100 species of cacti. The <i>nopal,</i> or prickly pear cactus abounds; local people remove the spines and grill the cactus pads or use them in healthful salads. The fruit of the prickly pear, called <i>tuna,</i> is used to make a refreshing drink, <i>agua de tuna.</i></div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fauna</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hunting, deforestation, and the encroachment of humans have diminished many once-abundant species. In the mountains far from humankind, endangered margay, jaguar, and ocelot hunt their prey, which includes spider monkeys, deer, and peccaries. More commonly seen are skunks, raccoons, rabbits, and coyote. The coatimundi is an endearing little animal that lives in family groups, often near streambeds. Inquisitive and alert, they resemble tall, slender prairie dogs. Along with tanklike, slow-moving armadillo, the sandy-brown coatimundi is among the animals you\'re most likely to spot without venturing too deep within the forest. Local people call the coatimundi both <i>tejón</i> and <i>pisote,</i> and often keep them as pets.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Poisonous snakes include the Mexican rattlesnake and the fer-de-lance. Locals call the latter <i>cuatro narices</i> (four noses) because it appears to have four nostrils. It\'s also called <i>nauyaca;</i> the bite of this viper can be deadly. There are more than a dozen species of coral snakes with bands of black, yellow, and red in different patterns. False corals imitate this color scheme to fool their predators, but unless you\'re an expert, it\'s best to err on the side of caution.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most famous of the migratory marine species is the humpback whale, here called <i>ballena jorobada,</i> or \"hunchback\" whale. These leviathans grow to 51 feet and weigh 40 to 50 tons; they travel in pods, feeding on krill and tiny fish. In a given year the females in area waters may be either mating or giving birth. During their annual migration of thousands of miles from the Bering Sea, the hardy creatures may lose some 10,000 pounds, or approximately 10% of their body weight. Hunted nearly to extinction in the 1900s, humpbacks remain an endangered species.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A few Bryde whales make their way to Banderas Bay and other protected waters near the end of the humpback season, as do some killer whales (orca) and false killer whales. Bottlenose, spinner, and pantropic spotted dolphins are present pretty much year-round. These acrobats love to bow surf just under the water\'s surface and to leap into the air. Another spectacular leaper is the velvety-black manta ray, which can grow to 30 feet wide. Shy but lovely spotted eagle rays hover close to the ocean floor, where they feed on crustaceans and mollusks. Nutrient-rich Pacific waters provide sustenance for a wide range of other sea creatures. Among the most eye-catching are the graceful king angelfish and the iridescent bumphead parrotfish, striped Indo-Pacific sergeants and Moorish idols, and the funny-looking guinea fowl puffer and its close relative, the equally unusual black-blotched porcupine fish.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The varied landscape of Nayarit and Jalisco states provides a tapestry of habitats for some 350 species of birds. In the mangroves, standouts are the great blue heron, mangrove cuckoo, and vireo. Ocean and shorebirds include red-billed tropic birds as well as various species of heron, egret, gulls, and frigate birds. Military macaws patrol the thorn forests, and songbirds of all stripes live in the pine-oak forests. About 40% of the birds in the Costalegre region are migratory. Among the residents are the yellow-headed parrot and the Mexican wood nymph, both threatened species.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Environmental Issues</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The biggest threat to the region is deforestation of the tropical dry forest. Slash-and-burn techniques are used to prepare virgin forest for agriculture and pasturing of animals. This practice is counterproductive, as the thin soil fails to produce after the mulch-producing trees and shrubs have been stripped.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The tropical dry forests (also called tropical thorn forest) are now being deforested due to the increasing tourism and human population. Controlled ecotourism offers a potential solution, although failed projects in the area have significantly altered or drained salt marshes and mangrove swamps.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The dry forest is an extremely important ecosystem. It represents one of the richest in Mexico and also one with the highest level of endemism (plant and animal species found nowhere else). Several species of hardwood trees, including the Pacific coast mahogany and Mexican kingwood, are being over-harvested for use in the building trade. The former is endangered and the latter, threatened.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">South of Puerto Vallarta in the Costalegre are two adjacent forest reserves that together form the 32,617-acre Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve. Co-owned and managed by nonprofit agencies, private companies, and Mexico\'s National University, UNAM, the reserve protects nine major vegetation types, including the tropical dry forest, tropical deciduous, and semi-deciduous forests. A riparian environment is associated with the north bank of the Cuixmala River. Within the reserve there are approximately 72 species considered at risk for extinction including the American crocodile and several species of sea turtles.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hojonay Biosphere Reserve was established by the Hojonay nonprofit organization to preserve the jaguar of the Sierra de Vallejo range and its habitat. The 157,060-acre reserve is in the foothills and mountains behind La Cruz de Huanacaxtle and San Francisco, in Nayarit State.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are no tours or casual access to either reserve, which serve as a buffer against development and a refuge for wildlife.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The People</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The population of Puerto Vallarta is overwhelmingly of mestizo (mixed Native American and white/European descent). According to the 2000 census, fewer than 1% of Jalisco residents speak an indigenous language. Compare that to nearby states: Michoacán with 3.6%; Guerrero with about 14%; and Oaxaca, where more than a third of the inhabitants converse in a native language. Those indigenous people who do live in Jalisco State are small groups of Purépecha (also called Tarascans), in the south. The Purépecha were among the very few groups not conquered by the Aztec nation that controlled much of Mesoamerica at the time of the Spanish conquest.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although not large in number, the indigenous groups most associated with Nayarit and Jalisco states are the Cora and their relatives, the Huichol. Isolated in mountain and valley hamlets and individual <i>rancherías</i> (tiny farms) deep in the Sierra Madre, both have maintained to a large extent their own customs and culture. According to the CDI (Comisión Nacional Para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas, or National Commission for the Development of Native Peoples), there are about 24,390 Cora in Durango, Zacatecas, and Nayarit states, and some 43,929 Huichol, mainly in Jalisco and Nayarit. Nearly 70% of the culturally related groups speak their native language.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1947 a group of prominent vallartenses was returning along twisty mountain roads from an excursion to Mexico City. When the driver lost control and the open-sided bus plunged toward the abyss, death seemed certain. But a large rock halted the bus\'s progress, and Los Favorecidos (The Lucky Ones), as they came to be known, returned to Puerto Vallarta virtually unharmed. Their untrammeled gestures of thanks to the town\'s patron saint, the Virgin of Guadalupe, set the precedent for this animated religious procession. Today, all Puerto Vallartans consider themselves to be Los Favorecidos, and thus universally blessed. This optimism and good cheer are two vital components of the local persona. For those of us fortunate enough to visit, that angelic magnetism is a big part of the pull.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Magic of Mexico</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To say that Mexico is a magical place means more than it\'s a place of great natural beauty and fabulous experiences. Cities like Catemaco, in Veracruz, have a reputation for their <i>brujos</i> and <i>brujas</i> (male and female witches, respectively) and herbal healers (<i>curanderos/curanderas</i>). But Mexicans use these services even in modern Mexico City and Guadalajara and in tourist towns like Puerto Vallarta. Some might resort to using a curandera to reverse <i>mal de ojo,</i> the evil eye, thought to be responsible for a range of unpleasant symptoms, circumstances, disease, or even death.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A <i>limpia,</i> or cleansing, is the traditional cure for the evil eye. The healer usually passes a raw chicken or turkey egg over the sufferer to draw out the bad spirit. Green plants like basil, or branches from certain trees can also be used, drawing the greenery over the head, front, and back to decontaminate the victim. Prayer is an essential ingredient.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Some cures are of a more practical nature. Mexican herbalists, like their colleagues around the world, use tree bark, nuts, berries, roots, and leaves to treat everything from dandruff to cancer. Epazote, or wormseed, is a distinctly flavored plant whose leaves are used in cooking. As its English name implies, its medicinal task is to treat parasites.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most folk wisdom seems to draw from both fact and, if not fiction, at least superstition. Breezes and winds are thought to produce a host of negative reactions: from colds and cramps to far more drastic ailments like paralysis. Some people prefer sweating in a car or bus to rolling down the window and being hit by the wind, especially since mixing hot and cold is something else to be avoided. Even worldly athletes may refuse a cold drink after a hot run. Sudden shock is thought by some to cause lasting problems.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although it doesn\'t take a leap of faith to believe that herbal remedies cure disease and grandma\'s advice was right on, some of the stuff sold in shops is a bit \"harder to swallow.\" It\'s difficult to imagine, for example, that the sky-blue potion in a pint-size bottle will bring you good luck, or the lilac-color one can stop people from gossiping about you. Those that double as floor polish seem especially suspect.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whether magic and prophesy are real or imagined, they sometimes have concrete results. Conquistador Hernán Cortés arrived on the east coast of Mexico in 1519, which correlated to the year \"One Reed\" on the Aztec calendar. A few centuries prior to Cortés\'s arrival, the benevolent god-king Quetzalcoatl had, according to legend, departed the same coast on a raft of snakes, vowing to return in the year One Reed to reclaim his throne.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">News of Cortés—a metal-wearing god-man accompanied by strange creatures (horses and dogs) and carrying lightning (cannons and firearms)—traveled quickly to the Aztec capital. Emperor Moctezuma was nervous about Quetzalcoatl\'s return and his reaction to the culture of war and sacrifice the Aztecs had created. In his desire to placate the returning god, Moctezuma ignored the advice of trusted counselors and opened the door for the destruction of the Aztec empire.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">La Vida Loca</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Living the good life in Mexico—specifically in and around Banderas Bay—seems to get easier year by year. Americans and Canadians are by far the biggest groups of expats. In addition to those who have relocated to make Mexico their home, many more foreigners have part-time retirement or vacation homes here. A two-bedroom property in a gated community by the sea begins at around $230,000. You could get more modest digs for less; at the upper end of the spectrum, the sky\'s the limit.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The sheer number of foreigners living in Puerto Vallarta facilitates adventures that were much more taxing a decade or two ago, like building a home or finding an English-speaking realtor or lawyer. Contractors and shopkeepers are used to dealing with gringos; most speak good to excellent English. The town is rich with English-language publications and opportunities for foreigners to meet up for events or volunteer work.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Top sights, restaurants, and hotels are within or near Old Québec, which takes up only 11 square km (4 square mi). The area is not flat, so walking takes a bit of effort, especially if you decide to walk to the Upper Town from the Lower Town. Helpful city maps are available at visitor-information offices, the best of which is on the public square in front of the Château Frontenac.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Great Itineraries</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 2 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With only a couple of days, you should devote one day to Lower Town, which is the earliest site of French civilization in North America, and the second day to Upper Town. On Day 1, stroll the narrow streets of the Quartier Petit-Champlain, visiting the Maison Chevalier and browsing at the many handicraft stores. Moving on to Place Royale, head for the Église Notre-Dame-des-Victoires; in summer there\'s almost always entertainment in the square. On Day 2, view the St. Lawrence River from Terrasse Dufferin and visit the impressive buildings of Upper Town, where 17th- and 18th-century religious and educational institutions predominate.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 4 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Four days will give you some time to explore outside the walls of the Old City as well as the countryside. Follow the itinerary above for a two-day trip. On Day 3, plan a picnic on the Plains of Abraham, site of the battle that ended France\'s colonial dreams in North America and marked the beginning of British rule in Canada. In the afternoon check out the Musée National des Beaux-Arts du Québec or the Musée de la Civilisation. On Day 4, head out of town to explore the Côte de Beaupré, including the colossal Basilique Ste-Anne-de-Beaupré, or see Montmorency Falls and Île d\'Orléans.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">St-Roche: Where It\'s At</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you want to be where it\'s at in Québec City, take a trip to the funky former industrial area St-Roch, bordered by the St-Charles River and the cliff, where artists first flocked about a decade ago and cafés, boutiques, galleries, restaurants, lofts, and condos followed.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">St-Roch\'s epicenter is Parc St-Roch, with its elongated flower beds and benches around a modern square. Rue St-Joseph is a shopping hot spot with places to savor a pot of imported tea, and pick up a little something for the house at <b>Villa</b> (600 St-Joseph Est. tel. 418/524-2666) or <b>Baltazar</b> (461 rue St-Joseph. tel. 418/524-1991). For high-end shopping, there\'s <b>Hugo Boss</b> (505 rue St-Joseph Est. tel. 418/522-5444) as well as a flurry of smaller boutiques with the latest urban wear.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There\'s plenty of green public space along boulevard Charest and the odd sculpture, too. Complexe Méduse is an avant-garde arts cooperative that houses multimedia artists, a community radio station, a café, galleries, artists-in-residence, and performance spaces.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">St-Roch is also becoming known for its exquisite dining experiences, such as the luxurious <b>L\'Utopie</b> (226½ rue St-Joseph Est. tel. 418/523-7878) within walking distance of a night on the town. After dinner, you can boogie down to a live DJ\'s picks at <b>Le Boudoir</b> (441 rue du Parvis. tel. 418/524-2777).

The monument recalls the 1759 battle on the Plains of Abraham, which ended French rule here. British general James Wolfe lived only long enough to hear of his victory; French general Louis-Joseph Montcalm died shortly after Wolfe with the knowledge that the city was lost. On the south side of the park is <b>avenue Ste-Geneviève,</b> lined with well-preserved Victorian houses dating from 1850 to 1900. Several have been converted to inns. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Parc Jeanne d\'Arc</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">An equestrian statue of Joan of Arc is the focus of this park, which is bright with colorful flowers in summer. A symbol of military courage and of France itself, the statue stands in tribute to the heroes of 1759 near the place where New France was lost to the British. The park also commemorates the Canadian national anthem, \"O Canada\"; it was played here for the first time on June 24, 1880. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Plains of Abraham</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This park, named after the river pilot Abraham Martin, is the site of the famous 1759 battle that decided New France\'s fate. People cross-country ski here in winter and in-line skate in summer. In summer a bus driven by a guide portraying Abraham Martin provides an entertaining tour—with commentary in French and English—around the park. At the <b>Discovery Pavilion of the Plains of Abraham</b> you can take in the multimedia display, Odyssey: A Journey Through History on the Plains of Abraham, which depicts 400 years of Canada\'s history. www.ccbn-nbc.gc.ca.

So, before you head out on that trek or boat trip, keep the following in mind:</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Be sure to wear the right protective clothing: sturdy hiking boots, a waterproof jacket, and a warm layer such as a fleece or wool pullover. Weather in this region, especially at high altitude, can change dramatically in a short time.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Watch out for sunburn—take sunscreen and a hat with you. Also bring bug repellent for sandflies, which are impossible to avoid in this region unless you\'re traveling offshore by boat.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\'re heading off without a guide for more than an hour or two, let someone know where and when you\'re going and when you\'ve returned. DOC visitor centers have sign-in books and issue regular weather and trail updates.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Use extreme caution when crossing rivers. Especially after rain, mountain runoff can quickly turn a gentle stream into an angry torrent, and drowning is a major hazard. If you do get trapped on one side of a quickly rising river, wait for the water to recede rather than risk crossing.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For longer treks into serious country always carry a map and compass, first-aid gear, bottled water, high-energy foods, warm clothes and tent, and a mountain radio or EPIRB (locator beacon—these can be rented locally). Cell phones don\'t work in the mountains.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lake Manapouri & Doubtful Sound</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just 20 minutes south of Te Anau, Lake Manapouri has long had the reputation as one of New Zealand\'s prettiest lakes. The subject of contentious debate back in the 1970s when hydroelectricity producers wanted to raise the level of the lake and submerge the town, it is now a very down-to-earth spot. The lake is unspoiled, hemmed by high mountains and studded by many bush-covered islands. Cruises run several times a day to the head of the lake, where you can join a tour of the West Arm hydro-station, deep underground. West Arm is also the departure point for those traveling on to Doubtful Sound, a stunning stretch of water, largely untouched by visitors. A connecting bus crosses you over the 2,177-foot Wilmot Pass before dropping steeply down to sea level at Deep Arm, the head of Doubtful Sound.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Real Journeys</b> (Pearl Harbour, Manapouri. tel. 03/249-660 or 0800/656-502. www.realjourneys.co.nz) runs daily cruise options on Lake Manapouri, providing scenic cruises, a visit to the power station, or connections to their Doubtful Sound cruises. Costs for these tours start at $59 per person. <b>Fiordland Expeditions</b> (Deep Cove, Doubtful Sound. tel. 03/442-2996. www.fiordlandexpeditions.co.nz) offers a truly New Zealand experience on their great little boat, <i>Tutuko.</i> Skipper Richard Abernethy is totally at home on these waters and will take you to the most inaccessible reaches of Doubtful Sound, or out and around the coast, weather permitting (which doesn\'t happen often). This is the tour to do if you want to do a bit of fishing, dive some of the world-class water beneath the boat, or just soak up the scenery, of which there is plenty. Tours are run by arrangement, rather than on a set schedule, so you\'ll need to make a group, or join one.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Hemmed in by walls of rock that rise from the waterline sheer up to 4,000 feet, the 13-km-long (18-mi-long) fiord was carved by a succession of glaciers as they gouged a track to the sea. Its dominant feature is the 5,560-foot pinnacle of <b>Mitre Peak,</b> which is capped with snow for all but the warmest months of the year. Opposite the peak, Bowen Falls tumbles 520 feet before exploding into the sea. On a clear day or after rain this is a spectacular place. Luxuriant rain forest clings to the sheer precipices washed with waterfalls. You\'ll often see seals on rocks soaking up the sun; dolphins sometimes flirt with the boats. But Milford Sound is also spectacularly wet: the average annual rainfall is around 20 feet, and it rains an average of 183 days a year. In addition to a raincoat you\'ll need insect repellent—the sound has voracious sandflies. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Aoraki (Mt. Cook)</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Above the grassy Mackenzie Basin towers Aoraki (Mt. Cook), at approximately 12,283 feet the tallest of the 22 peaks over 10,000 feet in <b>Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park.</b> The mountain\'s Maori name is Aoraki (Aorangi to North Island Maori), after one of three brothers who were the sons of Rakinui, the sky father. Legend has it that their canoe was caught on a reef and frozen, forming the South Island. In these parts, South Island\'s oldest Maori name is Te Waka O Aoraki (Aoraki\'s canoe) and the highest peak is Aoraki, himself frozen by the south wind, then turned to stone. Maori see these mountains as their ancestors. The officially recognized names of this mountain, the national park, and many other South Island places have been changed to their original Maori names as part of a 1998 settlement between the government and the major South Island Maori tribe, Ngai Tahu.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Aoraki was dramatically first scaled in 1894 by three New Zealanders—Tom Fyfe, George Graham, and Jack Clarke—just after it was announced that an English climber and an Italian mountain guide were about to attempt the summit. In a frantic surge of national pride, the New Zealand trio resolved to beat them to it, which they did on Christmas Day. In the summer of 1991 a chunk of it broke away, but fortunately there were no climbers in the path of the massive avalanches. High Peak, the summit, is now about 66 feet lower, but its altered form makes for a much more difficult ascent.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At 439 square km (270 square mi), the park is a formidable area of ice and rock, with glaciers covering 40% of the land and little forest cover. Unfortunately, the high altitude attracts its share of bad weather. Visitors can often stand at the end of Lake Tekapo or Lake Pukaki, looking westward, and not know that the country\'s highest mountain is just a few miles away. But that shouldn\'t prevent you from taking the 40-km (25-mi) paved road up to Mount Cook village. And stay the night while you\'re there—nowhere else in the region compares for a true alpine experience. Accommodation and food options range from luxury rooms to backpackers\' lodges and campsites. If the clouds lift, you\'ll be glad you stayed: the vistas are beyond spectacular.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The national park surrounds <b>Aoraki/Mount Cook Village</b> (population 300), which consists of a visitor center, a grocery store, an airfield, a pub, a little school, a hotel/motel complex, and several hostels. Walking is always an option, and in winter there\'s heli-skiing. If the weather is clear, a scenic flight around the Mt. Cook area and across to the West Coast can be the highlight of your stay in New Zealand. Contact the <b>Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park Visitor Centre</b> or the <b>weather phone</b> (tel. 03/435-1171) to check conditions before setting out on an unguided excursion. A network of hiking trails radiates from the Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park Visitor Centre, offering everything from easy walking paths to full-day challenges. There are some especially lovely wildflowers to search out, such as the Mount Cook lily, really the world\'s largest buttercup. A cairn just a few minutes along the track up the Hooker Valley remembers 40 of the more than 180 people who have died in the park since climbing began there. Be sure to fill your car\'s gas tank before leaving Twizel or Tekapo; although fuel is available at the Hermitage hotel, there are no credit card facilities at the pumps and the hours are limited.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For a unique hands-on educational experience take a half-hour hike to the fast-growing 2-square-km (1-square-mi) <b>Terminus Lake of the Tasman Glacier.</b> Fed by the glacier and the Murchison River, the lake was formed only in the past couple of decades, because of the glacier\'s retreat. Rock flour, a powdery white residue, gives the water a milky color (farther downstream, it also creates the unusual turquoise-blue color of Lake Pukaki). From Terminus Lake, which is officially growing by a foot a week, you can examine up close the terminal face of the glacier, which is 3 km (2 mi) wide. A trip with Glacier Explorers can take you by boat to explore some of the large floating icebergs that have calved (fallen away) from the Tasman Glacier. It\'s an eerie experience skimming across the milky-white water and closing in on icebergs—even riding <i>through</i> where they have melted—to touch rocks caught in the ice.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Another main activity is \"flightseeing.\" From the airfield at Mount Cook Village, helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft make spectacular scenic flights across the Southern Alps. One of the most exciting is the one-hour trip aboard the ski planes that touch down on the <b>Tasman Glacier</b> after a gorgeous scenic flight. The 10-minute stop on the glacier doesn\'t allow time for much more than a snapshot, but the sensation is tremendous. The moving tongue of ice beneath your feet—one of the largest glaciers outside the Himalayas—is 27 km (17 mi) long and up to 2,000 feet thick in places. The intensity of light on the glacier can be dazzling, and sunglasses are a must. In winter the planes drop skiers on the glacier at 10,000 feet, and they ski down through 13 km (8 mi) of powder snow and fantastic ice formations. With guides, this run is suitable even for intermediate skiers. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Continental flies nonstop from Houston. Delta connects Atlanta with Quito once daily. U.K. visitors can connect in Miami or Atlanta, or in Amsterdam with KLM, or in Madrid with Iberia or with discount airline Air Comet. From Australia or New Zealand, connect in Los Angeles to itineraries on American, Continental, or Delta.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tame, Ícaro, and AeroGal are Ecuador\'s domestic carriers; all offer flights several times daily to Guayaquil and Cuenca. Tame also flies between Quito and San Cristóbal and Baltra in the Galápagos Islands and to the mainland towns of Coca, Esmeraldas, Lago Agrio, Loja, Macas, Machala, Manta, Portoviejo, and Tulcán. AeroGal also flies between Quito and Manta, and Baltra and San Cristóbal, as well as Bogotá and Medellín, Colombia. Within South America, LanEcuador connects Quito with Lima and Santiago; TACA Peru connects it with Lima; Avianca with Bogotá; and Santa Bárbara Airlines with Caracas.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Quito\'s small, aging Aeropuerto Internacional Mariscal Sucre (UIO) is 8 km (5 mi) north of the city center. Stop at the Cooperativa de Taxis Aeropuerto booth beyond the customs barrier to arrange taxi transport. Prices are a fixed $6 for a ride to the New City. The new Aeropuerto Internacional de Quito is under construction near Puembo, about an hour east of the capital, at this writing. The $75 million facility is scheduled to open in 2010.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">By Bus</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Buses for most mainland destinations leave from Quito\'s sprawling Terminal Terrestre Cumandá, south of the Old City. Quito\'s buses are inexpensive (15) and run frequently during the day. Heavy crowds during the morning and afternoon rushes, however, make them less appealing options. Clearly marked ejecutivo buses cost 20 and guarantee you a seat, making them a more comfortable option. Much faster is the Trole (pronounced <i>tro</i>-lay), an electric trolley-bus system running through the center of town along Avenida 10 de Agosto in the New City and Calle Guayaquil in the Old City. A similar nonelectric system, the Ecovía, generally plies Avenida 6 de Diciembre between the New and Old cities. Fares for both are 25.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At this writing, a 30-km (18-mi) light-rail line called the TRAQ (Tren Rápido de Quito) is on the drawing board to replace the saturated Trole system. The 80-kph (48 mph) train will provide the fastest, easiest connection between Old and New Cities and beyond in each direction. Completion is scheduled for 2010.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">By Car</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Pan-American Highway runs right through Quito, which makes driving to most places in the country fairly easy. Short trips are possible to some of the nearby tourist areas but should be carefully planned because road conditions are not always good once you leave the main highway. Do not drive into the Amazon or anywhere near the Colombian border. A better idea is to rent a car and driver. Three of the major international rental agencies—Avis, Budget, and Hertz—have offices in downtown Quito and at Aeropuerto Mariscal Sucre. You can also rent a car from Localiza, an Ecuadoran company, at the airport.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lofty Heights</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The minute you step off the plane onto the jetway at Quito\'s airport, a sign advises you that you are now at 2,800 meters (9,200 feet) above sea level, and to take it easy your first couple of days here. Good advice.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">By Taxi</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Taxis are inexpensive and an ideal way to get around. A ride between the New and Old cities runs about $2. Most drivers use their meters, which begin tallying the fare at 35. Agree on a price beforehand if the driver says the meter isn\'t working. The fare to most destinations in the city should be $5 or less. Expect a $2 surcharge after dark. Tele Taxi and City-Taxi are reliable companies that will send a driver to pick you up. They will also arrange city tours for $10 per hour.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

In many cities, Quito included, the local Jesuit church outshone the local cathedral. La Compañía is the most impressive of the capital\'s 86 churches, with 10 side altars and a high altar plated with gold. An ambitious 25-year restoration project was completed in 2006, and if you see nothing else in Quito, don\'t miss this. The high central nave and the delicacy of its Arab-inspired plasterwork give the church a sumptuous, almost sinfully rich appearance. Indeed, almost half a ton of gold was poured into the ceilings, walls, pulpits, and altars during its 160 years of construction (1605-1765). At the center of the main altar is a statue of the Quiteña saint Mariana de Jesús; her remains are entombed at the foot of the altar.

You can take organized day trips from Reykjavík or explore the surrounding area yourself with a rental car. Ask travel agents or tour operators about special offers within Iceland that allow you to fly one way and take a bus the other. Theoretically, you can drive the Ring Road—the most scenic route, which skirts the entire Iceland coast—in two days, but that pace qualifies as rally-race driving, and you won\'t see much. You should plan on at least a week to travel the Ring Road, enjoying roadside sightseeing and relaxing in the tranquil environment along the way. Side jaunts add significant time, as secondary roads are often not paved. When traveling outside Reykjavík, always allow plenty of time to make it back for departing flights.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3-4 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Start by taking a leisurely tour of <b>Reykjavík.</b> The mix of the old and new in the capital\'s midtown is seen in the 19th-century <b>Alþingishús</b> and the <b>Ráðhús,</b> barely a decade old. Colorful rooftops abound, and ornate gingerbread can be spotted on the well-kept older buildings. Make sure you visit one of the seven outdoor thermal swimming pools, a great way to relax after a day of sightseeing and fun for the whole family.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On Day 2 head out to the countryside for the famous <b>Golden Circle</b> tour, and take in the spectacular <b>Gullfoss</b> waterfall, the <b>Geysir</b> hot springs area, and <b>Þingvellir National Park.</b> There are many organized tours that cover this route, or you can rent a car yourself.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you leave on Day 3, stop at the surreal <b>Blue Lagoon,</b> for a late morning-early afternoon dip that will leave you refreshed and is only 20 minutes from the airport if you have an afternoon flight connection.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you have an extra day, wake up early and head north to the <b>Snæfellsnes Peninsula</b> on Iceland\'s west coast. The <b>Hvalfjörður tunnel</b> cuts travel time dramatically. On emerging from the tunnel, bypass the town of Akranes and drive north to Borgarnes. Just north of it, turn west (left) on Route 54 out on the peninsula and head to the tiny village of <b>Arnarstapi.</b> If you left the capital before 9 AM, here is a good place to have lunch and take a stroll along the shore, watch small boats come and go, and marvel at the seabirds as they dive and soar. Afterward, enter Iceland\'s newest national park, Snæfellsjökull, and marvel at the mystical moods of this mountain as you circle north to Ólafsvík en route to Stykkishólmur. It takes a little over two hours to drive back to Reykjavík from here.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 6 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Complete the three full days of the tour above. Then you have two options:</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Option 1—Northern Journey: On the morning of Day 4 fly northeast to <b>Akureyri.</b> With a rental car visit the numerous historical houses here, such as <b>Matthíasarhús,</b><b>Nonnahús,</b><b>Laxdalshús,</b> and <b>Davíðshús.</b> After lunch, take some time at the <b>Lystigarðurinn.</b> Next drive east to the Lake Mývatn area, taking in <b>Goðafoss</b> and maybe even <b>Dettifoss</b> along the way. Spend a good part of Day 5 around <b>Mývatn,</b> visiting <b>Dimmuborgir</b> lava formations, <b>Námaskarð</b> sulfur springs, and the shoreline birding areas. Return to Akureyri and stay the fifth night (or you can take the last flight back to Reykjavík). On Day 6, leave the north on a morning flight back to Reykjavík, and if time permits, duck in for a quick dip in the <b>Blue Lagoon.</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Option 2—Southern Gems: Leave Reykjavík early on Day 4 and take your rental car south along Highway 1 through the towns of Hveragerði and Selfoss and past the stunning waterfalls of Skogafoss and Seljalandsfoss, beneath the glacier Eyjafjallajökull (each is off a short spur road). The sea arch of Dyrólaey, with its beautiful black beach, is just before the town of Vík, where you can spend the night. Continue east on Day 5 over wide lava flows and broad sandy plains to Skaftafell National Park and, farther east, to the Jökulsárlón glacial lagoon, where you can take a boat trip through the chunks of glacier floating in the water. Turn around and retrace your route west, where you can spend the night near Hella. Leave early on Day 6 to head toward the airport, through the villages of Stokksheyri and Eyjarbakki, stopping for a dip in the Blue Lagoon if there\'s time.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Geologist\'s Dream</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Where the warm southern Gulf Stream confronts the icy Arctic currents from the north, Iceland straddles the mid-Atlantic ridge at the merger of the North American and European tectonic plates. Volcanic activity continues to form the island by slowly forcing the plates to separate. During the past few centuries, a volcanic eruption has occurred on average every five years. Mt. Hekla erupted in February 2000, and the cauldron that awoke under the Vatnajökull glacier in the fall of 1996 quickly melted through hundreds of feet of ice not far from Grímsvatn.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Yet no one need wait for an eruption to be reminded of the fiery forces\' presence, because they also heat the hot springs and geysers that gurgle, bubble, and spout in many parts of the country. The springs, in turn, provide hot water for public swimming pools and heating for most homes and buildings, helping to keep the air smog-free. Hydropower generated by harnessing some of the country\'s many turbulent rivers is another main energy source that helps to keep pollution and the expense of fossil fuels at a minimum.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Icelandic History</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Iceland was settled by Vikings with strong Celtic elements in the late 9th century. Tradition has it that the first Norse settlers arrived in AD 874, but there is some evidence that Irish monks landed even earlier. Icelanders today speak a language remarkably similar to the ancient Viking tongue in which the sagas were recorded in the 13th and 14th centuries. The Norse settlers brought to the island sturdy horses, robust cattle, and Celtic slaves. Perhaps Irish tales of the supernatural inspired Iceland\'s traditional lore of the <i>huldufólk,</i> or hidden people, said to reside in splendor in rocks, crags, caves, and lava tubes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Iceland\'s near-universal literacy might be attributed to its long tradition of participatory democracy, dating from AD 930, when the first parliament met at Þingvellir. Icelandic tribal chiefs decided to join the Norwegian crown in the mid-13th century, and after many centuries under Norwegian, and later Danish, rule, Iceland finally gained full independence in 1944. Today Iceland is a modern Nordic—most find the term <i>Scandinavian</i> too limited—society with a well-developed social-welfare system and one of the highest standards of living in the world.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

If you\'ve got extra time in Rio, roam through the <b>Jardim Botânico</b>, bike around <b>Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas,</b> and consider an escape to <b>Prainha</b> and <b>Grumari</b> beaches and the <b>Sítio Roberto Burle Marx.</b></div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Top Reasons to Go</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beaches</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rio\'s beaches define its culture: vibrant, joyful, beautiful. From infants to senior citizens, and from women in barely-there string bikinis to Speedo-wearing men—and the tourists goggling at it all (yes, that man <i>is</i> wearing a thong!)—the beach culture seduces everyone who visits. Because the beaches are intertwined with the city\'s urban core, the cleanliness of the ocean can vary from day to day; your hotel concierge can help you decide which beach to hit for swimming.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Carnival</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rio\'s Carnival is right up there with Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and carnivals in Venice and Trinidad and Tobago. Carnival celebrations unfold all over Brazil, and there\'s a lively debate as to whether Rio or Salvador has the best, but no other city can match Rio in terms of glitter, glitz, or downright decadence.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Music</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rio is the music capital of Brazil. It witnessed the birth of bossa nova and <i>choro,</i> and it is here that samba became established as Brazil\'s national style. A seemingly endless stream of first-class concerts of all styles of Brazilian music takes place here: classical music at the Theatro Municipal, samba at Lapa\'s nightclubs, and bossa nova at Ipanema\'s bars, to name just a few.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Eating Out</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Be prepared to indulge in some of the finest dining you\'ve experienced. The cuisine in Rio is a true reflection of the ethnic diversity within Brazil. There are wonderful Portuguese and Brazilian options, but Rio is also home to fantastic Italian and Japanese restaurants.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Enjoying the Landscape</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The unique juxtaposition of sea and mountains makes Rio the beautiful city that it is. You can experience the view from the ocean by taking a boat cruise, or a more adventurous kayaking trip, or you can climb one of the many mountains of the Floresta da Tijuca by trolley or by foot to take in the view.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">What\'s Your Beach Style?</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rio\'s circuit of <i>praias</i> (beaches) begins with Flamengo, on Guanabara Bay, but the best strands are in the Zona Sul. Beaches are the city\'s pulse points: exercise centers, gathering places, lovers\' lanes. Although cariocas wander into the water to cool off, most spend their time sunning and socializing, not swimming. Copacabana and Ipanema are nerve centers. Beaches west of São Conrado are increasingly isolated and undeveloped.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Praia do Flamengo.</b> Power-walkers, volleyballers, and yoga enthusiasts come to Flamengo Beach to work up a sweat. It isn\'t a tourist destination, and you rarely see people swimming (pollution can be a problem) or sunbathing.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Praia do Botafogo.</b> The view of the bay and the Sugar Loaf from this beach is breathtaking, but it isn\'t a popular beach with tourists or even locals, due to pollution in the bay waters.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Praia do Vermelha.</b> This tiny beach neighboring the Pão de Açucar has beautiful scenery but polluted waters. It\'s generally populated only by cariocas who live nearby.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Praia do Leme.</b> A continuation of Copacabana Beach, Leme has a similar feel. Lined with kiosks and volleyball nets, it\'s a popular with locals and tourists.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Praia do Diabo.</b> Between Ipanema and Copacabana, this small strip attracts surfers. The view is beautiful, and if you\'re at Ipanema, it\'s worth the walk to Praia do Diabo.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Praia de Copacabana.</b> The city\'s grande dame, Copacabana is a 3-km (2-mi) stretch packed to the gills on sunny days with sunbathers, vendors, and athletes. Kiosks along its busy promenade have snacks and drinks. Cafés and high-rise hotels line the waterfront avenue.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Praia de Ipanema.</b> Always-crowded Ipanema is smaller than Copacabana, but equally famous. It\'s a perfect place to sunbathe and people-watch. At the east end is the dramatic rock formation Pedra do Arpoador; visible to the west, past Leblon, is the Morro Dois Irmaos (Two Brothers Mountain) and the hillside Vidigal favela.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Praia do Leblon.</b> Ipanema Beach extends west to meet Leblon Beach, which has the same feel. It\'s very popular for exercising on the sand or boardwalk. Water pollution is a problem.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Praia do São Conrado.</b> Hang gliders land here after leaping from a nearby peak. The proximity to the Rocinha favela keeps many people away. Tourists are rare.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Praia Barra da Tijuca.</b> Rio\'s longest beach (18 km/11 mi) has clean and cool waters. Its far end, called Recreio dos Bandeirantes, was a fishing village until the late 1960s. The neighborhood of Barra da Tijuca feels like a suburb, and the beach reflects that. It attracts families with young children and older folks out for a stroll.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Prainha.</b> Just beyond Barra da Tijuca, Prainha has rough seas that make it popular with surfers. It\'s nearly empty on weekdays.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Praia de Grumari.</b> The copper sands of this lovely beach are packed on weekends. It has little infrastructure but clean sand and water, and is backed by green hills.</div><div  class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>GETTING THERE</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For beaches not accessible by metro, consider taking a taxi. City buses and chartered minivans drop you off along the shore, but safety is an issue. Most beaches have parking lots—look for attendants in green-and-yellow vests. Turismo Clássico can arrange for drivers and guides.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Why Rio\'s Carnival Rules</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many people tout the virtues of Carnival in Salvador and other cities in Brazil, but Rio\'s Carnival is the real deal. After all, it was here that the whole thing started. The first samba schools appeared in Rio in the 19th century and it was here that the parades happened for the first time. It is no accident that for every Carnival (in February or early March, depending on where Lent falls on the calendar), Brazil comes to a halt to see the parades in Rio de Janeiro. In those four days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday) it\'s said that Brazilians think only of samba, women and beer—Rio\'s Carnival triad. Without the three, the party is not complete, Brazilians say.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <i>mulatas,</i> women fantasically dressed in barely-there sequin-and-feather-adorned costumes, are at the head of the parades. They are what one generally thinks of when Brazilian Carnival comes to mind—so again, what is considered a quintessential part of Carnival was born in Rio. Right behind them comes the rousing percussion wing. Then come the floats, full of color, over three meters high. Beautiful women with the tiniest of golden bikinis ride them, sensually dancing the samba, accompanied on the street level by the various <i>alas</i> (wings, or sections), of the <i>escola de samba</i> (samba school). Each of the 14 schools creates an overall theme with its floats, costumes, music, and dancers; each wing of the school wears a different type of costume, all of them breathtaking. In some cases, more than $1 million is spent on the extravagant displays. Rehearsals for the better part of a year lead to one hour-and-twenty-minute performance for each samba school. At the end of Carnival, the best samba school is elected the champion of the year\'s parade by a group of jurors, in a dispute closely followed by millions of Brazilians throughout the country.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though past Carnivals took place in Centro, today the parades are in the Sambódromo, a huge stadium, open only for Carnival, that was designed by the renowned architect Oscar Niemeyer and built in the heart of the city in 1984. It can be reached by subway or by taxi, and admittance tickets cost US$30—but if you want a seat, you\'ll pay between US$200 and $1,000. The Brazilian Tourism Office has links to a Sambódromo map on its Web site (www.braziltourism.org/sambodromo.shtml) and great tips about which seats to choose.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <i>carioca</i> (resident of Rio) makes no distinction between Brazilians and foreigners at Carnival, and even those who have no familiarity whatsoever with samba are welcome to participate in the event. To join a samba school all you have to do is attend one of the rehearsals in the school\'s headquarters and pay about US$200 for a costume (this includes the admittance ticket). Then just join the party!</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">-by Carla Aranha</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Eighteen presidents lived here. Gaze at the palace\'s gleaming parquet floors and intricate bas relief ceilings as you wander through its <b>Museu da República</b> (Museum of the Republic). The permanent exhibits include a shroud-draped view of the bedroom where President Getúlio Vargas committed suicide in 1954 after the military threatened to overthrow his government. Presidential memorabilia, furniture, and paintings that date from the proclamation of the republic to the end of Brazil\'s military regime in 1985 are also displayed. A small contemporary art gallery, a movie theater, a restaurant, and a theater operate within the museum. COST: Tues. and Thurs.-Sat., R$6. Wed. and Sun., free.

It\'s an apt setting for the plantation-turned-museum where Brazil\'s famous landscape designer Roberto Burle Marx is memorialized. Marx, the mind behind Rio\'s swirling mosaic beachfront walkways and the Atêrro do Flamengo, was said to have \"painted with plants\" and was the first designer to use Brazilian flora in his projects. More than 3,500 species—including some discovered by and named for Marx as well as many on the endangered list—flourish at this 100-acre estate. He grouped his plants not only according to their soil and light needs but also according to their shape and texture. Marx also liked to mix the modern with the traditional—a recurring theme throughout the property. The results are both whimsical and elegant. In 1985 he bequeathed the farm to the Brazilian government, though he remained here until his death in 1994. His house is now a cultural center full of his belongings, including collections of folk art. The grounds also contain his large ultramodern studio (he was a painter, too) and a small, restored colonial chapel dedicated to St. Anthony. COST: R$5. OPEN: Tues.-Sun. by appointment only; Tours at 9:30 AM and 1:30 PM. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Embraced by the arms of the colonnades of St. Peter\'s Square, they attend Papal Mass, marvel at St. Peter\'s Basilica, and savor Michelangelo\'s Sistine Ceiling.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Colosseum</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Legend has it that as long as the Colosseum stands, Rome will stand; and when Rome falls, so will the world. One of the seven wonders of the world, the mammoth amphitheater was begun by Emperor Vespasian and inaugurated by Titus in the year 80. For \"the grandeur that was Rome,\" this obstinate oval can\'t be topped.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Piazza Navona</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You couldn\'t concoct a more Roman street scene: caffès and crowded tables at street level, coral- and rust-colored houses above, most lined with wrought-iron balconies, and, at the center of this urban \"living room,\" Bernini\'s spectacular Fountain of the Four Rivers and Borromini\'s super-theatrical Sant\'Agnese.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Roman Forum</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This fabled labyrinth of ruins variously served as a political playground, a commerce mart, and a place where justice was dispensed during the days of the emperors (500 BC to 400 AD). Today, the Forum is a silent ruin—<i>sic transit gloria mundi</i> (so passes away the glory of the world).</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Campidoglio</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Catch a bird\'s-eye view of the Roman Forum from Michelangelo\'s piazza, situated atop one of the highest spots in Rome, the Capitoline Hill. Here you\'ll find the Capitoline Museums and beloved Santa Maria in Aracoeli.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Trevi Fountain</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the few fountains in Rome that\'s actually more absorbing than the people crowding around it, the Fontana di Trevi was designed by Nicola Salvi in 1732. Immortalized in <i>Three Coins in the Fountain</i> and <i>La Dolce Vita,</i> this granddaddy of all fountains may be your ticket back to Rome—that is, if you throw a coin into it.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Spanish Steps</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Byron, Shelley, and Keats all drew inspiration from this magnificent \"Scalinata,\" constructed in 1723. Connecting the ritzy shops at the bottom with the ritzy hotels at the top, this is the place for prime people-watching. The steps face west, so sunsets offer great photo-ops.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Castel Sant\'Angelo</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Originally constructed as a mausoleum for Roman emperor Hadrian, this cylindrical building, which towers over the city\'s skyline, alternately served as a fortress, a castle, and papal prison.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Trastevere</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Located just across the Tiber River, this time-stained, charming neighborhood is a maze of jumbled alleyways, traditional Roman <i>trattorie,</i> cobblestone streets, and medieval houses. The area also boasts the oldest church of Rome—Santa Maria in Trastevere.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Musei Capitolini</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">None other than the great Michelangelo would suffice to design the master plan for Rome\'s own collection of art and archaeological museums, which enticingly crown the Capitoline Hill. The museum is divided into two wings: Palazzo Nuovo, devoted to ancient sculpture, and the Palazzo dei Conservatori, with great Old Masters.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Palazzo Doria-Pamphili</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Waltzing through this 17th-century palace may be the closest you ever get to the aristocratic nobles. Fabled Old Master paintings line the walls, with pride of place going to Velàzquez\'s <i>Innocent X</i> (the family pope), perhaps the greatest portrait ever painted.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Palazzo Altemps</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Catch a glimpse of exquisite taste in this 15th-century palace, once owned by Cardinal Altemps and today part of the Museo Nazionale Romano—on view are many legendary examples of classic Greek and Roman sculpture, including the \"Ludovisi Throne.\"</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Galleria Borghese</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Only the best could only satisfy the aesthetic taste of Cardinal Scipione Borghese, whose holdings evoke the essence of Baroque Rome. Spectacularly frescoed ceilings and multihued marble walls frame great Bernini sculptures and paintings by Titian and Raphael.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Keats-Shelley House</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">During the 18th century, the Spanish Steps became a gathering place for Grand Tour artists and writers, so here in 1821 the English Romantic poet John Keats came to write—and ultimately die (of tuberculosis)—in the Casina Rossa, a dusty pink house at the base of the steps.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museo Nazionale Romano</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city\'s own great collections of ancient Roman sculpture, paintings, and precious relics—salvaged from excavations completed over several centuries—is so vast that four separate museums at different locations are needed: Palazzo Altemps, Aula Ottagona, Terme di Diocleziano, and Palazzo Massimo alle Terme.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Villa Farnesina</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><i>Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,</i> Renaissance-era version, are on display at this extravagant villa, built around 1511 by banker Agostino Chigi, with loggias decorated by Raphael. After lavish dinners, Chigi would toss his gold plates into the Tiber and slyly retrieve them with a net in the water.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Vatican Museums</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The seemingly endless line waiting for entry here can be intimidating, but the reward—a vast collection of masterpieces, including the Raphael Rooms—make it worth it. The agony, not the ecstasy, of it all is summed up in Michelangelo\'s sublime <i>Last Judgment</i> and Sistine ceiling.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Palazzo Barberini</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The three fathers of the Baroque—Bernini, Borromini, and Pietro da Cortona—whipped up this imposing 17th-century palace for the Croesus-rich Barberini family. Built around 1625, with the Gran Salone, Rome\'s largest ballroom, the palazzo is now home to the city\'s collection of Old Master paintings.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Palazzo Spada</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A glorious 17th-century assemblage of stuccowork and statuary, together with the impressive trompe l\'oeil \"trick\" of its courtyard colonnade, inspired by master designer Borromini, is what draws the crowds.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">St. Peter\'s Basilica</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Every year, millions of pilgrims flock to the world\'s most important Catholic church, as art lovers marvel at Michelangelo\'s cupola, Bernini\'s papal altar, and the vast nave. The burial site of its namesake, St. Peter\'s took such Italian masterminds as Raphael and Bramante more than a century to complete.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Santa Maria in Trastevere</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Even locals can\'t help being mesmerized by the splendors of this church\'s piazza, chief among them being the incandescent Byzantine mosaics on the basilica\'s facade and the elegant octagonal fountain. Inside, the vast nave stupefies with its gigantic Roman columns and glittering golden mosaics.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sant\'Ignazio</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Studying the dome up high in this fantastically bejeweled 1626 Jesuit church, you may think your eyes are playing tricks on you. But it\'s not your eyes! That extraordinarily accurate replica of a Baroque dome was painted in its place after plans for the cupola fell through.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sant\'Agnese in Agone</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Prominently positioned in Piazza Navona, this church has some of Rome\'s most quintessential Baroque architecture. Designed by Borromini (1652), a fervent rival of Bernini\'s, the church\'s facade is a stunning symphony of voluminous concave spaces and bell towers.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Santa Maria in Cosmedin</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Moody, medieval, and magnificent, this 12th-century Romanesque church draws throngs to its portico where the stone Bocca della Verità (Mouth of Truth) sits in judgment—dare you test the legend that its stone jaws clamp shut on the hands of the untruthful?</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">San Clemente</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Uncover the layers of Medieval Rome here at this half-basilica, half archaeological site. Famed for its mosaics, this 12th-century church actually sits on top of another church that dates back to the 4th century <i>and</i> a 2nd-century BC temple to the pagan god, Mithras.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Santa Maria del Popolo</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Few other churches in Rome reflect the richness of Renaissance art as does Santa Maria del Popolo, thanks to its nave enlarged by Bramante and the Chigi Chapel, a Raphael masterwork. But equally striking are Baroque treasures like Caravaggio\'s Cerasi Chapel and Bernini\'s mosaic-covered dome.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Santa Maria sopra Minerva</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Set on a piazza graced by Bernini\'s famed elephant obelisk, this Gothic-style church—best known for Michelangelo\'s <i>Risen Christ</i> and famed frescoes by Filippino Lippi—gives off a heavenly aura, thanks to arched blue ceilings ashimmer with gold stars.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Santa Maria in Aracoeli</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Set on the Capitoline Hill and atop a towering, 137-step stairway (designed in 1348 to celebrate the passing of the Black Death), this Romanesque-Gothic landmark was begun in the 6th century and is home to the famed Santo Bambino, a carved-wood Baby Jesus figure.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">San Giovanni in Laterno</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\'s hard to miss the 15 gargantuan marble statues (including Christ and the 12 Apostles) that tower over the facade of Rome\'s official cathedral and first church of the popes. The Baroque interior was accomplished by Borromini, but many pilgrims head first to the legendary Scala Santa (Holy Steps).</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Tips on Touring the Vatican Museums</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Remember that the Vatican\'s museum complex is humongous—only after walking through what seems miles of galleries do you see the entrance to the Sistine Chapel (which, note should be made, cannot be entered from St. Peter\'s Basilica directly). Check out the Sistine location vis-a-vis the main church on their Web site: http://www.stpetersbasilica.org/. Most people—especially those who rent an audio guide, who must return it to the main desk—tour the complex, see the Sistine, then trudge back to the main museum entrance, itself a 15-minute walk from St. Peter\'s Square.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">However, there is an \"insider\" way to exit directly from the Sistine Chapel to St. Peter\'s Basilica: Look for the \"tour groups only\" door on the right as you face the rear of the chapel—when a group exits, go with the flow and follow them. This will deposit you in St. Peter\'s Basilica and you won\'t have to take that 15-minute hike back to St. Peter\'s Square, nor run the gauntlet of the basilica\'s security line (note: the X-ray machines can prove hazardous to your camera film).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In point of fact, this \"groups\" exit will deposit you on a line forming to go up to St. Peter\'s Dome—if you wish to ascend the dome, take this golden opportunity, as long lines form for this attraction around at the basilica entrance.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Note that if you run to the Sistine Chapel, then do the \"short-cut\" exit into the basilica, you will have missed all the rest of the Vatican Museum collection.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This means you should probably plan on touring the complete complex, including the ancient statues and the Pinacoteca painting collection, before you get to the Sistine.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Today\'s Rome ...</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">... is not the Roma your mother knew</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Home to nearly 3 million residents and a gazillion tourists, Rome is virtually busting at the seams. For decades, the city was all about its <i>centro storico</i>, where a chunk of the city\'s most fabled museums, monuments, and cultural relics have stood for centuries. Replete with postcard landmarks, Baroque palaces, and hyper-luxury hotels, the \"Disneyfication\" of the historic center is well under way.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As there was no room to grow upward, Rome has had to stretch outward. To relieve pressure in the city center, city officials have focused on building a \"new\" Rome beyond the historic quarter. In the process, old, economically weaker, satellite districts have been revitalized. Former working-class neighborhoods—San Lorenzo to the north, Ostiense and Testaccio to the south—have become trendy. This \"other\" Rome is now studded with buildings designed by superstar architects and neighborhoods that are shabby-chic, alternative, and full of flair.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">... is creating new \"It\" neighborhoods</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The leader among Rome\'s \"It\" nabes is San Lorenzo, set just a stone\'s throw away from the Termini train station. Rome\'s new \"Left Bank\" district is filled with students and a young bohemian crowd thanks to its close proximity to the La Sapienza University. In fact, if you don\'t know what you\'re looking for, you could easily get lost in this maze of dark narrow streets, many now lined with underground caffès, bars, hip restaurants, and locales with live-music venues. The leading scene-arenas include Formula 1 (Via degli Equi 13), for top pizzas; Da Franco ar Vicoletto (Via dei Falisci 1/b), just around the corner, for fish lovers; and Arancia Blu (Via dei Latini 55), which draws the green crowds thanks to its vegetarian menus. The likes of bands such as The Cure, U2, and Pearl Jam have been known to play at I Giardini di Adone (Via dei Reti 38/A). Or throw down your best moves at Balic (Via degli Aurunci 35), where the vibe is ethno-chic disco-pub.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">... is going multi-culti</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend a day in Rome\'s Esquilino neighborhood and you\'ll see just how multicultural the Eternal City is becoming. Once famous for its spice market at Piazza Vittorio, the area neighborhood has fast become a multiethnic stomping ground. In fact, finding a true Roman restaurant or a local shopkeeper is hard to come by in this area, now that Chinese, Indian African, and Middle Eastern restaurants have moved in (a typical example: the Syrian restaurant, <i>Zenobia,</i> perched on Piazza Dante, even includes a weekend belly-dancing show). Homegrown and locally produced, the Orchestra di Piazza Vittorio is a perfect picture of the neighborhood\'s growing ethnic population. Made up of 16 musicians from Brasil, Senegal, Tunisia, Cuba, Argentina, Hungary, Ecuador, and Italy, the troupe was founded in 2002 and got its start in the ramshackle district just steps away from Rome\'s Termini train station.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">... is going Hollywood</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A physicist with a secret symbol branded on his dead body. An antimatter bomb meant to incinerate the Vatican. A 400-year-old secret society unleashing scientific terrorists against the Catholic church. Take these elements, then add in Gian Lorenzo Bernini\'s greatest sculptures, Rome\'s historic settings, and a climax that features everything but the <i>Starship</i><i>Enterprise</i>, and you have <i>Angels &amp; Demons,</i> the page turner that is Dan Brown\'s prequel to his smash novel, <i>The Da Vinci Code.</i>Hollywood arrive in April 2008 to film.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Director Ron Howard probably called out for \"Lights...camera...and <i>lots</i> of violent action!\" For when four cardinals (candidates to be the new pope) wind up missing and murdered at a papal enclave, it is up to Tom Hanks and Naomi Watts to track down the trail of the Illuminati, the secret society founded by Galileo, Bernini, and others to bolster science against the 17th-century Inquisition. The \"Path of Illumination\" that they follow through Rome leads to four Altars of Science: Raphael\'s Chigi Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo (Earth); the \"West Ponente\" disk in St. Peter\'s Square (Air); Bernini\'s <i>Ecstasy of St. Theresa</i> in Santa Maria della Vittoria (Fire); and Bernini\'s Piazza Navona fountain (Water). Along the way, they decipher mysterious ambigrams, uncover corpses in St. Peter\'s, and unlock the Illuminati\'s lair (in Castel Sant\'Angelo, no less).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many of the sights in the book and film are now included on popular \"Angels &amp; Demons\" walking tours. No matter that critics have faulted Brown for factual errors, gratuitous violence, and James Bond-like shenanigans—any project that can bring Bernini\'s greatest masterpieces to the world\'s movie multiplexes gets our vote.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">... is breaking old ground</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the fall of 2007, archaeologists unearthed an important discovery dating back to the birth of Rome. A domed cavern with lustrous mosaics, which experts believe to be the sacred sanctuary of the Lupercal dedicated to Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome, was discovered underneath the House of Augustus near the Palatine Hill. Legend has it that Romulus and Remus, sons of the god Mars, were abandoned by the Tiber river and later discovered in a nearby cave by a female wolf who nursed them. City officials plan to make the site open to the public once restoration is finished in 2009.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">... is looking a lot like Epcot</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At least if you headed to Rome\'s brand-new and cutting-edge convention center, the Nuova Fiera di Roma. Its space-age archways and atrium make it look like it would fit right in at Walt Disney World\'s Epcot. The new exposition center is located just minutes from Rome\'s Fiumicino Airport, conveniently connected by railway, and replaces the original Fiera di Roma located in EUR. The new facility boasts 22 pavilions covering more than 300,000 square meters of land—a prominent contender on the European-Expo scene for business tourism, conferences, and conventions.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">... is shopping-till-you-drop</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Three maxi-shopping complexes were opened in the span of two years in and around Rome. The first to open was Centro Commerciale Leonardo, with some 200 stores, conveniently located near Rome\'s Fiumicino Airport and connected by train to and from the city center. Originally conceived to be the granddaddy of malls in Italy, Roma Est opened its doors in March 2007 with 200 individual outlets and a mega-movie complex. In July 2007, that mall was trumped by the giant shopping playground, Porta di Roma, where shoppers can choose from 250 stores, and even that\'s not the full picture. By 2008, when the rest of the mall is slated for completion, a bowling alley, multiplex movie theater, two indoor swimming pools, and a fitness facility will have been added. On the rooftop level, shoppers will be able to blow off steam on one of four tennis courts, two mini-soccer fields, and a covered swimming pool, plus two rooftop restaurants.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">... is in love with amore</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many a Roman lothario feels the need to prove the everlasting quality of his love. One of the ways favored recently was inspired by scenes from the 2007 movie version of the popular Italian book, <i>Ho Voglia Di Te</i> (<i>I Really Want You</i>). In this scenario, Riccardo Scarmarcio, Italy\'s leading teen heartthrob plays an impassioned lover who literally chains his sweetheart to a lamppost on the Ponte Milvio bridge—which spans the Tiber—then dramatically throws the key into the river. So many couples began flocking to the Tiber-spanning bridge to reenact the scene that one of the lampposts collapsed some months after the movie\'s release. To cope with the craze, city officials installed 24 heart-shaped columns on the bridge, with chains strong enough to withstand the hundreds of locks. A Web site (<i>www.lucchettipontemilvio.com</i>) was also created for die-hard romantics who wish to create a virtual lovelock.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">... is more commuter-friendly</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Plans are underway to build Rome\'s third subway line, or \"Line C.\" Slated for completion in 2015, the new line will cover key parts of the historic city center, including Piazza Venezia and Largo Argentina. City officials also approved construction of an extension of the B-line from the Metro\'s Piazza Bologna station, adding four more stops, with completion for 2010. Relief is also in store for commuters traveling aboveground: ATAC, Rome\'s public bus transportation company, has added GPS monitors to help track distances and waiting times, with the new tracking devices already in place at major bus stops throughout the city.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">... is going green</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In efforts to further promote an \"environmentally friendly\" way of living, the city of Rome teamed up with the Ministry for the Environment and installed seven new stations where cars, scooters, and bicycles that run on electricity can recharge their batteries. There are now a total of 11 recharging stations across the city including those closest to the historic city center: Piazza Mastai (Trastevere), Via Appia Nuova (San Giovanni), Piazza Cola di Rienzo (St. Peter\'s), and Viale Europa (EUR). Currently, there is no fee for recharging your vehicles (though the city plans to implement a 40-euro-cent fee for use in the future).</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">... is breaking new ground</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Eternal Rome is in the middle of a building boom, one kick-started by the Vatican\'s 2000 Jubilee celebrations and backed by Rome\'s can-do mayor, Walter Veltroni.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Voguish new landmarks, like the Parco della Musica, a set of three armadillolike music halls designed by modernist Renzo Piano, garnered magazine covers; the slaughterhouse-turned-contemporary art museum of MACRO al Mattatoio earned headlines; and minimalist masterpieces like Richard Meier\'s Jubilee Church may yet prove to be as enduring and image-defining as were Michelangelo\'s Palazzo Senatorio or Bernini\'s St. Peter\'s Square.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When it comes to transforming an old working-class district into a scene-arena,\"starchitects\" and their new iconic buildings often lead the way.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">New case in point: Rem Koolhaas recently won the competition to revamp Ostiense\'s Mercati Generali food market.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Before long this moldering landmark will be transformed into Rome\'s \"Covent Garden.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Magliana is now the site of a new model residential complex rising up near Rome\'s airport and designed by Richard Rogers, architect of Paris\'s Beaubourg Centre and New York City\'s Hearst Tower.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Among the newest projects is the Casa della Ballo (House of Dance).

It was entirely rebuilt by the emperor Hadrian around AD 120 on the site of an earlier pantheon (from the Greek <i>pan,</i> all, and <i>theon,</i> gods) erected in 27 BC by Augustus\'s general Agrippa. The majestic circular building was actually designed <i>by</i> Hadrian, as were many of the temples, palaces, and lakes of his enormous villa outside the city at Tivoli. Hadrian nonetheless retained the inscription over the entrance from the original building that named Agrippa as the builder, in the process causing enormous confusion among historians until, in 1892, a French architect discovered that all the bricks used in the Pantheon dated from Hadrian\'s time.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most striking thing about the Pantheon is not its size, immense though it is (until 1960 the dome was the largest ever built), nor even the phenomenal technical difficulties posed by so vast a construction; rather, it\'s the remarkable unity of the building. You don\'t have to look far to find the reason for this harmony: the diameter described by the dome is exactly equal to its height. It\'s the use of such simple mathematical balance that gives classical architecture its characteristic sense of proportion and its nobility and why some call it the world\'s only architecturally perfect building. The great opening at the apex of the dome, the oculus, is nearly 30 feet in diameter and was the temple\'s only source of light. It was intended to symbolize the \"all-seeing eye of heaven.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To do the interior justice defied even Byron. He piles up adjectives, but none seems to fit: \"Simple, erect, severe, austere, sublime.\" Not surprising, perhaps, when describing a dome 43 meters high and the same across and built to mirror the universe itself, albeit in Roman times a geocentric one. Poised on top of a mighty concrete ring, the five levels of trapezoid-shaped coffers represent the course of the five then-known planets and their concentric spheres. Then, ruling over them, comes the sun represented symbolically and literally by the 9-meter-wide eye at the top. The heavenly symmetry is further paralleled by the coffers themselves: 28 to each row, the number of lunar cycles. Note how each coffer takes five planetary steps toward the wall. Then in the center of each would have shone a small bronze star. Down below the seven large niches were occupied, not by saints, but statues of Mars, Venus, the deified Caesar, and the other \"astral deities,\" including the moon and sun, the \"sol invictus.\" And in their midst, to quote one historian, would sit the emperor, his authority bolstered by the system above \"while in the role of universal legislator he set in motion new laws and presided over the Supreme Court.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Pantheon is by far the best preserved of the major monuments of imperial Rome, a condition that is the result of it being consecrated as a church in AD 608. No building, church or not, escaped some degree of plundering through the turbulent centuries of Rome\'s history after the fall of the empire. In 655, for example, the gilded bronze covering the dome was stripped. Similarly, in the early 17th century, Pope Urban VIII removed the bronze beams of the portico, using the metal to produce the <i>baldacchino</i> (canopy) that covers the high altar at St. Peter\'s Basilica. Most of its interior marble facing has also been stripped and replaced over the centuries. Nonetheless, the Pantheon suffered less than many other structures from ancient Rome.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Pantheon serves as one of the city\'s important burial places. Its most famous tomb is that of Raphael (between the second and third chapels on the left as you enter). The inscription reads \"Here lies Raphael; while he lived, mother Nature feared to be outdone; and when he died, she feared to die with him.\" Two of Italy\'s 19th-century kings are buried here, too: Vittorio Emanuele II and Umberto I. The tomb of the former was partly made from bronze that had been taken from the Pantheon by Urban VIII to cast as cannon. Thankfully, the temple\'s original bronze doors have remained intact for more than 1,800 years. Be sure to ponder them as you leave. COST: Free. OPEN: Mon.-Sat. 8:30 -7:30, Sun. 9-5:30. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Musei Capitolini</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Surpassed in sheer size and richness only by the Musei Vaticani, this immense collection was the first public museum in the world. A greatest-hits collection of Roman art through the ages, from the ancients to the Baroque, it is housed in the twin Museo Capitolino and Palazzo dei Conservatori that bookend Michelangelo\'s famous piazza. Here, you\'ll find some of antiquity\'s most famous sculptures, such as the poignant <i>Dying Gaul,</i> the regal <i>Capitoline Venus,</i> the <i>Esquiline Venus</i> (identified as another Mediterranean beauty, Cleopatra herself), and the <i>Lupa Capitolina</i>, the very symbol of Rome itself. Although some pieces in the collection—first assembled by Sixtus IV (1414-84), one of the earliest of the Renaissance popes—may excite only archaeologists and art historians, others are unforgettable, including the original bronze statue of Marcus Aurelius whose copy sits in the piazza.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Buy your ticket and enter the museums on the right of the piazza (as you face the center Palazzo Senatorio), into the building known as the Palazzo dei Conservatori. Lining the courtyard are the colossal fragments of a head, leg, foot, and hand—remains of the famous statue of emperor Constantine the Great, who believed that Rome\'s future lay with Christianity. These immense effigies were much in vogue in the latter days of the Roman Empire. Take the stairs up past a series of intricately detailed ancient marble reliefs to the resplendent Salone dei Orazi e Curiazi (Salon of Horatii and Curatii) on the first floor. The ceremonial hall is decorated with a magnificent gilt ceiling, carved wooden doors, and 16th-century frescoes depicting the history of ancient Rome. At both ends of the hall are statues of the Baroque era\'s most charismatic popes: a marble Urban VIII (1568-1644) by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598-1680) and a bronze Innocent X (1574-1655) by Bernini\'s rival, Algardi (1595-1654). The renowned symbol of Rome, the Capitoline Wolf, a 6th-century BC Etruscan bronze, holds a place of honor in the room; the suckling twins were added during the Renaissance to adapt the statue to the legend of Romulus and Remus.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Marcus Aurelius Status</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The centerpiece and, indeed, heart of the museum is the Exhedra of Marcus Aurelius (Sala Marco Aurelio), a large, airy room with skylights and high windows, which showcases the spectacular original bronze statue of the Roman emperor whose copy sits in the piazza below. Created in the 2nd century AD, the statue should have been melted down like so many other bronze statues of emperors after the decline of Rome, but this one is thought to have survived because it was mistaken for a likeness of the Christian emperor Constantine, rather than of the pagan Marcus Aurelius. Also under the glass roof of the Sala are the spectacular remains of a colossal bronze statue of Constantine.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The room segues into the area of the Temple of Jupiter, with its original ruins rising organically into the museum space. A reconstruction of the temple and Capitol Hill from the Bronze Age to present day make for a fascinating glance through the ages. On the top floor is the museum\'s pinacoteca, or painting gallery, which has some noted Baroque masterpieces, including Caravaggio\'s La Buona Ventura (1595) and San Giovanni Battista (1602), Peter Paul Rubens\'s (1577-1640) Romulus and Remus (1614), and Pietro da Cortona\'s (1627) sumptuous portrait of Pope Urban VIII. Adjacent to the Palazzo dei Conservatori is <b>Palazzo Caffarelli,</b> where temporary exhibitions are mounted. Here, set on the Piazzale Caffarelli, the new Caffè Capitolino offers a spectacular vista over Rome (looking toward St. Peter\'s)—it is open daily (except Monday) 9 to 8 in the evening.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To reach the Palazzo Nuovo section of the museum (the palace on the left-hand side of the Campidoglio), take the stairs or elevator to the basement of the Palazzo dei Conservatori, where a corridor called the Galleria Congiunzione leads to the Tabularium, holding a poignant collection of ancient gravestones, connects the two buildings underground. But before going up into Palazzo Nuovo, be sure to take the detour to the right to the Tabularium Gallery with its unparalleled view over the Roman Forum.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Room of the Emperors</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Inside the Palazzo Nuovo is the noted Sala degli Imperatori, lined with busts of Roman emperors, along with the Sala dei Filosofi, where busts of philosophers sit in judgment—a fascinating who\'s who of the ancient world, and a must-see of the museum.Although many ancient Roman treasures were merely copies of Greek originals, portraiture was one area in which the Romans took precedence. Within these serried ranks are 48 Roman emperors, ranging from Augustus to Theodosius (AD 346-395). On one console, you\'ll see the handsomely austere Augustus, who \"found Rome a city of brick and left it one of marble.\" On another rests Claudius \"the stutterer,\" an indefatigable builder brought vividly to life in the history-based novel I, Claudius by Robert Graves. Also in this company is Nero, one of the most notorious emperors—though by no means the worst—who built for himself the fabled Domus Aurea. And, of course, there are the standout baddies: cruel Caligula (AD 12-41) and Caracalla (AD 186-217), and the dissolute, eerily modern boy-emperor, Heliogabalus (AD 203-222). In the adjacent Great Hall, be sure to take in the 16 resplendently restored marble statues.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Downstairs at the center of the courtyard near the exit is the gigantic, reclining figure of Oceanus, found in the Roman Forum and later dubbed Marforio, one of Rome\'s famous \"talking statues\" to which citizens from the 1500s to the 1900s affixed anonymous satirical verses and notes of political protest. www.museicapitolini.org. COST: EUR  6.50 EUR. OPEN: Tues.-Sun. 9-8. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Musei Vaticani</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Other than the pope and his papal court, the occupants of the Vatican are some of the most famous artworks in the world. The museums that contain them are part of the <b>Vatican Palace,</b> residence of the popes since 1377. The palace consists of a number of individual buildings containing an estimated 1,400 rooms, chapels, and galleries. The pope and his household occupy only a small part of the palace, most of the rest of which is given over to the Vatican Library and Museums. Beyond the glories of the Sistine Chapel, the collection is so extraordinarily rich you may just wish to skim the surface, but few will want to miss out on the great antique sculptures, the Raphael Stanze, and Old Master paintings, such as Leonardo da Vinci\'s <i>St. Jerome.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Subsidiary Museums</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Among the collections on the way to the chapel, the <b>Egyptian Museum</b> (in which Room II reproduces an underground chamber tomb of the Valley of Kings) is well worth a stop. The <b>Chiaramonti Museum</b> was organized by the Neoclassical sculptor Canova and contains almost 1,000 copies of classical sculpture. The gems of the Vatican\'s sculpture collection are in the <b>Pio-Clementino Museum,</b> however. Just off the hall in Room X, you can find the <i>Apoxyomenos</i> (Scraper), a beautiful 1st-century AD copy of a bronze statue of an athlete. There are other even more famous pieces in the <b>Octagonal Courtyard,</b> where Pope Julius II installed the greatest pieces from his private collection: on the left stands the celebrated <i>Apollo Belvedere.</i> In the far corner, on the same side of the courtyard, is the <i>Laocoön</i> group, found on Rome\'s Esquiline Hill in 1506, held to be possibly the single most important antique sculpture group in terms of its influence on Renaissance artists.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">An adjacent hall dedicated to animals is filled with sculpture and mosaics done in colored marble, some of them very charming. There\'s a gallery of classical statues and a <b>Gallery of Busts;</b> the smallish <b>Mask Room</b> displays a lively mosaic pavement from the emperor Hadrian\'s Villa at Tivoli just outside Rome, and a copy of the 4th-century BC Greek sculptor Praxiteles\' <i>Cnidian Venus.</i> In the <b>Hall of the Muses,</b> the <i>Belvedere Torso</i> occupies center stage: this is a fragment of a 1st-century BC statue, probably of Hercules, all rippling muscles and classical dignity, much admired by Michelangelo. The lovely neoclassical room of the <b>Rotonda</b> has an ancient mosaic pavement and a huge porphyry basin from Nero\'s palace, as well as several colossal statues. The room on the Greek-cross plan contains two fine porphyry sarcophagi (great marble burial caskets), one of Costantia and one of St. Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Upstairs is an <b>Etruscan Museum,</b> an <b>Antiquarium,</b> with Roman originals; and the domed <b>Sala della Biga,</b> with an ancient chariot. In addition, there are the <b>Candelabra Gallery</b> and the <b>Tapestry Gallery,</b> including some designed by Raphael. Perhaps used more as a grand passageway, the incredibly long <b>Gallery of Maps</b> is frescoed with 40 maps of Italy and the papal territories, commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII in 1580. Nearby is the <b>Apartment of Pius V.</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The Raphael Stanze</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rivaling the Sistine Chapel for artistic interest are the <b>Stanze di Raffaello</b> (Raphael Rooms), which are directly over the Borgia apartments and can be very crowded with people. Pope Julius II moved into this suite of rooms in 1507, four years after his election. Reluctant to continue living in the Borgia apartments with their memories of his ill-famed predecessor, Alexander VI, he called in Raphael to decorate his new quarters. When people talk about the Italian High Renaissance—thought to be the very pinnacle of Western art—it\'s Raphael\'s frescoes they\'re probably thinking about. The theme of the <b>Segnatura Room,</b> the first to be frescoed, was painted almost entirely by Raphael himself (as opposed to the other rooms, which were painted in large part by his assistants). The theme of the room—which may broadly be said to be \"enlightenment\"—reflects the fact that this was Julius\'s private library.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Theology triumphs in the fresco known as the <i>Disputa,</i> or <i>Debate on the Holy Sacrament,</i> on the wall behind you as you enter. Opposite, the <i>School of Athens</i> glorifies philosophy in its greatest exponents. Plato (perhaps a portrait of Leonardo da Vinci), in the center, is debating a point with Aristotle. The pensive figure on the stairs is thought to be modeled after Michelangelo, who was painting the Sistine ceiling at the same time Raphael was working here. Michelangelo does not appear in preparatory drawings, so Raphael may have added his fellow artist\'s portrait after admiring his work. In the foreground on the right are Euclid, the architect Bramante, and, on the far right, the handsome youth just behind the white-clad older man is Raphael himself. Over the window on the left are Parnassus, who represents poetry, and Apollo, the Muses, and famous poets, many of whom are likenesses of Raphael\'s contemporaries. In the lunette over the window opposite, Raphael painted figures representing and alluding to the Cardinal and Theological Virtues, and subjects showing the establishment of written codes of law. Beautiful personifications of the four subject areas, Theology, Poetry, Philosophy, and Jurisprudence, are painted in circular pictures on the ceiling above.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The first in the series is the <b>Incendio Room</b>; it was the last to be painted in Raphael\'s lifetime, and was executed mainly by Giulio Romano, who worked from Raphael\'s drawings for the new pope, Leo X. It served as the pope\'s dining room. The frescoes depict stories of previous popes called Leo, the best of them showing the great fire in the Borgo (the neighborhood between the Vatican and Castel Sant\'Angelo), which threatened to destroy the original St. Peter\'s Basilica in AD 847; miraculously, Pope Leo IV extinguished it with the sign of the cross. The other frescoes show the coronation of Charlemagne by Leo III in St. Peter\'s Basilica, the <i>Oath of Leo III,</i> and a naval battle with the Saracens at Ostia in AD 849, after which Pope Leo IV showed clemency to the defeated.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Eliodoro Room</b> is a private antechamber. Working on the theme of Divine Providence\'s miraculous intervention in defense of endangered faith, Raphael depicted Leo the Great\'s encounter with Attila; it\'s on the wall to your left as you enter. The <i>Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple of Jerusalem,</i> opposite the entrance, refers to Pope Julius II\'s insistence on the Church\'s right to temporal possessions. He appears on the left, watching the scene. On the left window wall, the <i>Liberation of St. Peter</i> is one of Raphael\'s best-known and most effective works.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Adjacent to the Raphael Rooms, the <b>Hall of Constantine</b> was decorated by Giulio Romano and other assistants of Raphael after the master\'s untimely death in 1520. The frescoes represent various scenes from the life of the emperor Constantine. Don\'t miss the tiny <b>Chapel of Nicholas V,</b> aglow with Fra Angelico (1395-1455) frescoes of episodes from the life of St. Stephen (above) and St. Lawrence (below), one of the greatest gems of Renaissance art. If it weren\'t under the same roof as Raphael\'s and Michelangelo\'s works, it would undoubtedly draw greater attention.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Returning downstairs, you enter the <b>Borgia apartments,</b> where some intriguing historic figures are depicted in the elaborately painted ceilings, designed but only partially executed by Pinturicchio at the end of the 15th century, and greatly retouched in later centuries. It\'s generally believed that Cesare Borgia murdered his sister Lucrezia\'s husband, Alphonse of Aragon, in the Room of the Sibyl. In the Room of the Saints, Pinturicchio painted his self-portrait in the figure to the left of the possible portrait of the architect Antonio da Sangallo. (His profession is made clear by the fact that he holds a T-square.) The lovely picture of St. Catherine of Alexandria is said to be a representation of Lucrezia Borgia herself. The resurrection scene in the next room, the Room of the Mysteries, offers excellent portraits of the kneeling Borgia pope, of Cesare Borgia (the soldier with a lance at the center), and of the young Francesco Borgia (the Roman at the soldier\'s side), who also was probably assassinated by Cesare.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the frescoed exhibition halls that are part of the Vatican Museums, the <b>Vatican Library</b> displays precious illuminated manuscripts and documents from its vast collections. The <b>Aldobrandini Marriage Room</b> contains beautiful ancient frescoes of a Roman nuptial rite, named for their subsequent owner, Cardinal Aldobrandini. The <b>Braccio Nuovo</b> (New Wing) holds an additional collection of ancient Greek and Roman statues, the most famous of which is the <i>Augustus of Prima Porta,</i> in the fourth niche from the end on the left. It\'s considered a faithful likeness of the emperor Augustus, who was 40 years old at the time. Note the workmanship in the reliefs on his armor.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The Vatican Pinacoteca</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Much more celebrated are the works on view in the <b>Pinacoteca</b> (Picture Gallery). These often world-famous paintings are almost exclusively of religious subjects and are arranged in chronological order, beginning with works of the 11th and 12th centuries. Room II has a marvelous Giotto triptych, painted on both sides, which formerly stood on the high altar in the old St. Peter\'s. In Room III you\'ll see Madonnas by the Florentine 15th-century painters Fra Angelico and Filippo Lippi. The Raphael Room contains some of the master\'s greatest creations, including the exceptional <i>Transfiguration,</i> the <i>Coronation of the Virgin,</i> and the <i>Foligno Madonna</i> as well as the tapestries that Raphael designed to hang in the Sistine Chapel. The next room contains Leonardo\'s beautiful (though unfinished) <i>St. Jerome</i> and a Bellini <i>Pietà.</i> A highlight for many is Caravaggio\'s gigantic <i>Deposition.</i> In the courtyard outside the Pinacoteca you can admire the reliefs from the base of the Colonna di Marco Aurelio, the column in Piazza Colonna. A fitting finale to your Vatican visit can be found in the <b>Museo Pio Cristiano</b> (Museum of Christian Antiquities), where the most famous piece is the 3rd-century AD statue called the <i>Good Shepherd,</i> much reproduced as a devotional image.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For those interested in guided visits to the Vatican Museums, head to the Office of Guided Visits to Vatican Museums located on the Piazza San Pietro.

Typical of the outré style of the period, the eyes are the house\'s windows; the entrance portal is through the monster\'s mouth (this is one of the best photo-ops in Rome—have someone photograph you standing in front of the door with your own mouth gaping wide). Zuccaro—whose frescoes adorn many Roman churches, including Trinità del Monti just up the block—sank all of his money into this bizarre creation, dying in debt before his curious memorial, as it turned out to be, was completed. Today, it is the property of the Biblioteca Hertziana, Rome\'s prestigous fine-arts library. Leading up to the quaint Piazza Trinità del Monti, Via Gregoriana is a real charmer and has long been one of Rome\'s most elegant addresses, with residents ranging from French 19th-century painters Ingres and David to famed couturier Valentino. Metro: Spagna. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Palazzo Altemps</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Containing some of the finest ancient Roman statues in the world, this collection formerly formed the core of the Museo Nazionale Romano. As of 1995, it was moved to these new, suitably grander digs. The palace\'s sober exterior belies a magnificence that appears as soon as you walk into the majestic courtyard, studded with statues and covered in part by a retractable awning. It\'s a reconstruction of a nicety used in many a patrician abode, a throwback to the type of awning that shaded the ancient Romans in the Colosseum. The restored interior hints at the splendid Roman lifestyle of the 16th through 18th centuries and serves as a stunning showcase for the most illustrious pieces from the Museo Nazionale\'s collection of ancient Roman sculpture, which includes famous pieces from the Ludovisi family collection. In the frescoed salons you can see the <i>Galata,</i> a poignant work portraying a barbarian warrior who chooses death for himself and his wife rather than humiliation by the enemy. Another highlight is the large Ludovisi sarcophagus, magnificently carved from marble. In a place of honor is the Ludovisi Throne, which shows a goddess emerging from the sea being helped by her acolytes. For centuries this was heralded as one of the most sublime statues of Greek sculpture but, today, at least one authoritative art historian considers it a colossally overrated fake. Look for the framed explanations of the exhibits that detail (in English) how and exactly where Renaissance sculptors, Bernini among them, added missing pieces to the classical works.

The <b>Central</b> area, south and east of the main railway station, is focused on the pedestrianized zone around the Lijnbaan and Van Oldenbarneveltstraat. This is where the city goes out to shop—all the major department stores and many exclusive boutiques are located here. Along the river are three old harbors, <b>Delfshaven, Oude Haven,</b> and <b>Leuvehaven,</b> although there is little similarity between them. Charming Delfshaven is so narrow it looks like a canal, and is lined with gabled houses dating back centuries, creating a classic Dutch scene. The Oude Haven, by contrast, is surrounded by modern buildings, some of which, like the Blaak Rail Station and Kijk-Kubus, are among Rotterdam\'s most-iconic buildings.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the south of the river, across the Erasmus Bridge, the <b>Kop van Zuid</b> and <b>Entrepot</b> districts are where famous architects such as Sir Norman Foster and Renzo Piano have been given free rein to design housing projects, theaters, and public buildings to complete the area\'s transformation into a modern and luxurious commercial and residential district. <b>Museumpark</b> is the cultural heart of the city, and home to four museums and bordered by a Sculpture Terrace. Because these different areas are fairly spread out, to get between them you may want to make use of the efficient public transport network (taxis are expensive). Buses and trams fan out across the city above ground, while two underground metro lines—one north-south, one east-west—offer an even faster way of getting about. To use the network you\'ll need an <b>OV-chipkaart</b> (public transport chip card)—a new electronic payment system that\'s being tested in Rotterdam before being rolled out nationally in 2009.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Brief History of Delft</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Delft has more than painterly charm—many great men lived and died here. Toward the end of the 16th century Prince William of Orange (known as William the Silent) settled in Delft to wage his war against Spanish rule. He never left: the nation\'s founder was assassinated in his mansion in 1584 by a spy of the Spanish Duke of Alva, and buried in the Nieuwe Kerk (New Church). Also buried here is Grotius, the humanist and father of international law. And Delft was home to Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek, who mastered the fledging invention of the microscope and was born the same year as Vermeer, 1632. Vermeer was just one of many artists who set up shop in the city—which had grown rich with the trade in butter, cloth, beer, and pottery.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Delft\'s history was often turbulent. In the 17th century, the canal water became tainted, forcing 180 of the 200 resident breweries to close. In 1654, the \"Thunderclap,\" an accidental gunpowder explosion, leveled half the town and killed hundreds. But Delft rebounded thanks to riches it had amassed as the headquarters of the Dutch East India Company. The porcelains their traders brought back from the Far East proved irresistible, and in 1645 De Porceleyne Fles started making and exporting the famous blue-and-white earthenware that soon became known the world over as Delft Blue.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Thanks to the fortuitous way the Barons van Zuylen had of marrying Rothschilds, their family home grew into a Neo-Gothic extravaganza replete with moat, fairy-tale spires, and machicolated towers. The castle was founded back in 1165, but several renovations and many millions later, the family expanded the house under the eye of P. J. H. Cuypers, designer of Amsterdam\'s Centraal Station and Rijksmuseum in 1892. Inside the castle are acres of tapestries, medieval iron chandeliers, and the requisite ancestral portraits snootily studying you as you wander through chivalric halls so opulent and vast they could be opera sets.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At de Haar, be sure to explore the magnificent gardens and park, dotted with romantic paths, fanciful statues, and little bridges. As was the wont of aristo owners in the 19th century, entire villages were relocated to expand their estate parks, and in this case, Haarzuilens was reconstructed a mile from the castle. Designed in 1898 around a village square, all its cottages have red-and-white doors and shutters, reflecting the armorial colors of the Van Zuylen family. Every year in September, the village funfair is kicked off by the current baron to the accompaniment of a fireworks display. As for the castle itself, you can view its grand interiors only via one of the guided tours (no kids under five), which leave on the hour and are led only in Dutch. No matter, the objects of beauty on display can be understood in any language. Once you explore this enchanted domain, you\'ll easily understand why Marie-Hélène van Zuylen, who grew up here, went on to become Baroness Guy de Rothschild, the late-20th-century\'s \"Queen of Paris,\" famous for her grand houses and costume balls. Directions for car travelers are given on the castle Web site. For public transport, take Bus No. 127 from Utrecht Centraal Station, direction Breukelen/Kockengen, until the Brink stop in Haarzuilens, a 15-minute walk from the castle. You can also train it to Vleuten and then take a taxi. www.kasteeldehaar.nl. COST: EUR 8, grounds only EUR 3, parking EUR 3. OPEN: Grounds daily 10-5; castle Tues.-Fri. 11-4, weekends noon-4.

The modern art section runs the gamut from Monet to Warhol and beyond, picking up Kandinsky, Magritte, and Dalí in between. In the Decorative Art and Design collection, both precious ornamental objects and everyday utensils dating from medieval times are displayed.

By the 1700s, other legends—about piles of gold and mines full of jewels—had been proven false by Spanish explorers, but the lake legend endured. Following a source of water through the West\'s harsh desert, and traveling along a flat river bank instead of struggling over mountains, would make trade easier between New Mexico and the settlements springing up along California\'s coast. Perhaps goods could be shipped to the coast rather than hauled by mules, a trip the Spanish guessed (and they were right) would take months.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Franciscan fathers Francisco Atanasio Dominguez and Francisco Silvestre Velez de Escalante came close to finding Great Salt Lake in 1776, but they cut through the Wasatch Mountains too far to the south. They did blaze a major trade route through Utah, but there is no record of any travelers wandering far enough off the route to see the lake of legend. In 1804-05, Lewis and Clark searched for a water route to the West Coast, but their focus on the Columbia River gave them no reason to travel south of Idaho. They, too, missed the lake.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mountain men had heard of the lake. Legend has it that an argument about the lake broke out at the alcohol-soaked 1824 rendezvous in northern Utah—the trappers couldn\'t agree whether the nearby Bear River flowed into the lake. Jim Bridger was chosen to settle the argument, some say because he was the youngest. For whatever reason, he was set adrift on the Bear River in a rickety bull boat and told to report his findings at a future rendezvous—if he survived.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Jim Bridger did survive, and he was able to report that the Bear River did flow into the Great Salt Lake. However, his travels and those of fellow mountain man Jedediah Smith indicated that the lake was landlocked. Plus it was no good for drinking. (With no rivers to drain the lake, water that flows in has no way out but to evaporate, leaving behind a highly concentrated solution of salts and minerals.) Even worse, the explorers found that travel around the lake was hampered by vast expanses of marshland, a muddy shoreline, and hundreds of square miles of salt flats that looked solid but were often little more than a thin crust over layers of muck.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With dreams of a freshwater oasis and an easy route to the coast crushed, the legends of the lake changed. The lake became a place where monsters lurked in the water, giants rode elephantlike creatures on the islands, and the bottom periodically opened, swallowing everything nearby. The area became a place to avoid, or to pass by quickly, until 1847, when Brigham Young and the Mormon pioneers crossed the plains to settle on its shore.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Each bloco has its own all-purpose beer, first-aid, and toilet truck—and you\'ll have instant camaraderie with your crewmates. (A warning: it\'s not unusual for women to be kissed by strangers. It might sound feeble, but having a male friend close may deter unwanted groping.)</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Favorite bloco themes include Egyptian-garbed percussion band Olodum, and axé acts Are Ketu and Timbalada. Alternatively, there\'s the peaceful Filhos de Ghandy (Children of Ghandi), a white sea of robes and jeweled turbans. Once you\'ve chosen your bloco, all you have to do is lay down upward of US$100 to buy a crew-specific T-shirt, called an <i>abadá,</i> purchased at Central do Carnival kiosks, or at markets from scalpers.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Blocos travel along specific <i>circuitos</i> (routes) through the city. Seaside Dodô (about 1 mi, 5 hours) is the route of choice for Carnival\'s biggest stars and begins at Farol da Barra. Osmar (about 2 mi, 6 hours), beginning near Campo Grande, is large and traditional. The less-populated and calmer Batatinha, which clings to historic Pelourinho, allows an intimate look at smaller percussionist groups and is popular with families. Prepare by checking the maps atwww.carnaval.salvador.ba.gov.br (click on Mapas do Circuito).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Add to all of these fine reasons to patronize Salvador\'s Carnival the more than 20 pre-Carnival warm-up celebrations and its honor in the <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> as the biggest street carnival on the planet, and it\'s hard to argue that, come Carnival season, true partiers shouldn\'t be anywhere but Salvador.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">-Joe Gould</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beach Savvy</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As a rule, the farther away from the downtown area, the better the beach in terms of water cleanliness and number of people, especially on weekends.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Beaches in Bahia, as in most of Brazil, tend not to have facilities like bathrooms or showers.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pickpocketing and minor theft can be a problem. Bring as few items to the beach as possible, and just enough money for the day. Never leave anything unattended.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Vendors, no matter what age or gender, tend to be aggressive and overly persistent in Bahia, sometimes bordering on harassment. You might have to say no many times before they move on. Be patient or look for police officers (there are usually several on duty at Centro Historico for this reason alone).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Larger cities such as Salvador, Ilhéus, and Porto Seguro have quick and comfortable public transportation to beaches, like the <i>ônibus executivo</i> (executive bus; a minibus or van, usually labeled roteiro das praias).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Be careful when entering the water for the first time—a few steps in can put you in deep waters.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Be aware of rock outcroppings and coral reefs that can cut your feet.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you plan to snorkel, bring your own gear. Rentals are not always available.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Food and drink are available at almost every beach, except those you have to hike to.

The ceiling was painted in 1774 by José Joaquim da Rocha, who founded Brazil\'s first art school. The ornate cedar-and-rosewood interior is covered with images of mermaids and other fanciful creatures bathed in gold leaf. Guides say that there\'s as much as a ton of gold here, but restoration experts maintain there\'s much less. At the end of Sunday morning mass, the lights are switched off so you can catch the wondrous subtlety of the gold leaf under natural light. The <b>Convento de São Francisco</b> (tel. 071/3322-6430), part of the church complex, has an impressive series of 37 white-and-blue tile panels lining the walls of the cloister, each with a scene from Greco-Roman mythology. The <b>Ordem Terceira de São Francisco</b> (tel. 071/321-6968), on the north side of the complex, has an 18th-century Spanish plateresque sandstone facade—the only one in Brazil—that is carved to resemble Spanish silver altars made by beating the metal into wooden molds.

The headquarters of Projeto Tamar, established in 1980, has turned what was once a small, struggling fishing village into a tourist destination with a mission—to save Brazil\'s giant sea turtles and their hatchlings. During the hatching season (September through March), workers patrol the shore at night to locate nests and move eggs or hatchlings at risk of being trampled or run over to safer areas or to the open-air hatchery at the base station. Here you can watch adult turtles in the swimming pools and see the baby turtles that are housed in tanks until they can be released to the sea. Eighteen other Tamar base stations on beaches along 1,000 km (621 mi) of coastline in five northeastern Brazilian states protect about 400,000 hatchlings born each year. The headquarters also has educational videos, lectures, and a gift shop where you can buy turtle-theme gifts. From December to February, you can sign up for the \"Tartaruga by Night\" project to help release hatchlings from the station hatchery to the sea. www.tamar.org.br. COST: R$12.

The <b>Hellbrunner Allee</b> from Freisaal to Hellbrunn Palace is a pleasurable run, taking you past Frohnburg Palace and a number of elegant mansions on either side of the tree-lined avenue. The more adventurous can go farther afield, taking the <b>Salzach cycle path</b> north to the village of Oberndorf, or south to Golling and Hallein.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mozart: Marvel & Mystery</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">\"Mozart is sunshine.\" So proclaimed Antonin Dvorak—and how better to sum up the prodigious genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (January 27, 1756-December 5, 1791)? Listening to his Rococo orchestrations, his rose-strewn melodies, and his insouciant harmonies, many listeners seem to experience the same giddiness as happiness. Scientists have found Mozart\'s music can cause the heart to pound, bring color to the cheeks, and provide the expansive feeling of being thrillingly alive. Yet, Mozart must have sensed how hard it is to recognize happiness, which is often something vaguely desired and not detected until gone. It is this melancholy undertow that makes Mozart modern—so modern that he is now the most popular classical composer, having banished Beethoven to second place. Shortly after <i>Amadeus</i> won the 1984 Oscar for best film—with its portrayal of Mozart as a giggling, foul-mouthed genius—<i>Don Giovanni</i> began to rack up more performances than <i>La Bohème.</i> The bewigged face graces countless \"Mozartkugeln\" chocolates, and Mostly Mozart festivals pay him homage. But a look behind the glare of the spotlights reveals that this blond, slightly built tuning-fork of a fellow was a quicksilver enigma.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Already a skilled pianist at age three, the musical prodigy was dragged across Europe by his father Leopold to perform for empresses and kings. In a life that lasted a mere 35 years, he spent 10 on the road—a burden that contributed to making him the first truly <i>European</i> composer. Growing up in Salzburg, the <i>Wunderkind</i> became less of a <i>Wunder</i> as time went by. Prince-Archbishop Hieronymus von Colloredo enjoyed dissing his resident composer by commanding him to produce \"table music\" with the same disdainful tone he commanded his chef\'s dinner orders. Being literally forced to sit with those cooks, Mozart finally rebelled. In March 1781 he married Constanze Weber and set out to conquer Vienna.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hated by Mozart\'s father, Constanze is adored today, since we now know she was Mozart\'s greatest ally. Highly repressed by stuffy Salzburg, Mozart came to like his humor glandular (he titled one cantata \"Kiss My XXX\") and his women globular, a bill Constanze adequately filled. She no doubt heartily enjoyed the fruits of his first operatic triumph, the naughty <i>Abduction from the Seraglio</i> (1782). His next opera, <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> (1786), to no one\'s surprise, bombed. Always eager to thumb his nose at authority, Mozart had adapted a Beaumarchais play so inflammatory in its depiction of aristos as pawns of their own servants, it soon helped ignite the French Revolution. In revenge, wealthy Viennese gave a cold shoulder to his magisterial <i>Don Giovanni</i> (1787). Mozart was relegated to composing, for a lowly vaudeville house, the now immortal <i>Magic Flute</i> (1790), and to ghosting a <i>Requiem</i> for a wealthy count. Sadly, his star only began to soar after a tragic, early death. But in company with fellow starblazers Vincent van Gogh and Marilyn Monroe, we assume he must be enjoying the last laugh.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">-Robert I. C.

It was built early in the 17th century by Santino Solari for Markus Sittikus, after the latter had imprisoned his uncle, Wolf-Dietrich, in the fortress. The castle has some fascinating rooms, including an octagonal music room and a banquet hall with a trompe-l\'oeil ceiling. Hellbrunn Park became famous far and wide because of its <b>Wasserspiele,</b> or trick fountains: in the formal gardens, a beautiful example of the Mannerist style including a later-added outstanding mechanical theater, some of the exotic and humorous fountains spurt water from strange places at unexpected times—you will probably get doused (bring a raincoat). A visit to the gardens is highly recommended: nowhere else can you experience so completely the realm of fantasy that the grand Salzburg archbishops indulged in. The <b>Monatsschlösschen,</b> the old hunting lodge (built in one month), contains an excellent folklore museum. Following the path over the hill you find the <b>Steintheater</b> (Stone Theater), an old quarry made into the earliest open-air opera stage north of the Alps. The former palace deer park has become a <b>zoo</b> featuring free-flying vultures and Alpine animals that largely roam unhindered. You can get to Hellbrunn by Bus 25, by car on Route 159, or by bike or on foot along the beautiful Hellbrunner Allee past several 17th-century mansions. On the estate grounds is the little gazebo filmed in <i>The Sound of Music</i> (\"I am 16, going on 17\")—the doors are now locked because a person once tried to repeat the movie\'s dance steps, leaping from bench to bench, and managed to fall and break a hip. www.hellbrunn.at.

Mozart.\" The setting is splendid, as this building was Prince-Archbishop Wolf-Dietrich\'s \"overflow\" palace (he couldn\'t fit his entire archiepiscopal court into the main Residenz across the plaza). As such, it features 10 state reception rooms that were among the first attempts at a <i>stil Renaissance</i> in the North. Highlights of the archaeological collection include Hallstatt Age relics, remains of the town\'s ancient Roman ruins, and the famous Celtic bronze flagon found earlier this century on the Dürrnberg near Hallein (15 km [10 mi] south of Salzburg). Pride of place is given to the spectacular <b>Sattler Panorama,</b> one of the few remaining 360-degree paintings in the world, which shows the city of Salzburg in the early 19th century.

Eight take-it-to-the-max roller coasters are here, including Superman: Krypton Coaster (the Southwest\'s largest steel coaster) and the new Goliath, a suspended looping coaster that opened in spring 2008. The more than 40 other rides include a white-water rapids flume and a tower drop. Rounding out the offerings are many excellent family-friendly musical shows (a lasting feature from when the property was owned by Opryland)—Fiesta Texas has won the Golden Ticket award for best theme-park shows in the country for nine straight years. Some of the shows invite audience participation. Concerts with big-name artists are also held periodically throughout the season. www.sixflags.com/fiestaTexas. COST: $46.99. OPEN: Mar.-Dec., hours vary. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Brackenridge Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The 343-acre green space between U.S. 281 and Broadway Street (also known as State Spur 368) makes an excellent setting for a picnic or a stroll, and also offers jogging trails, public art, athletic fields, a golf course, concessions, and rides on a carousel and miniature train. However, the park is much more than just an outdoorsy retreat. It\'s home to—or in the vicinity of—many noteworthy attractions: the San Antonio Zoo, the San Antonio Botanical Gardens, the Japanese Tea Gardens, McNay Art Museum, and the Witte Museum. Families should budget at least half a day here. COST: Free. OPEN: Daily 5AM-11PM. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">River Walk</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <i>Paseo del Rio</i> is the city\'s (and the state\'s) leading tourist attraction. Built a full story below street level, it comprises about 3 mi of scenic stone pathways lining both banks of the San Antonio River as it flows through downtown, connecting many of the city\'s tourist attractions. (Soon, however, it will expand to 13 miles, connecting downtown with Brackenridge Park to the north and the missions to south.) In some places the walk is peaceful and quiet; in others it is a mad conglomeration of restaurants, bars, hotels, shops, and strolling mariachi bands, all of which can also be seen from river taxis and charter boats. www.thesanantonioriverwalk.com.

A member of the Franciscan order, Father Serra was part of a larger expedition chartered by King Charles III of Spain and headed by explorer Don Gaspar de Portola to travel north from Baja California and occupy the territory known then as Alta California.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When they arrived in San Diego, the Spaniards found about 20,000 Kumeyaay Indians living in a hundred or so villages along the coast and inland. The missionaries attempted to convert them to Christianity, and taught them agricultural and other skills so they could work what would become the missions\' vast holdings.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mission San Diego Alcalá, established on a hillside above what is now Mission Valley, was the first of the 21 that the Franciscans ultimately built along the coast of California. After establishing the mission and presidio in San Diego, Serra and Portola moved on, founding the Mission San Carlos Borromeo and presidio at Monterey. This was later moved to Carmel, where Father Serra settled and maintained his headquarters until his death in 1784.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Father Serra, the padre president of California, established nine missions. Besides those at San Diego and Monterey, these were: San Antonio de Padua, 1771; San Gabriel, 1771; San Luis Obispo, 1772; Dolores, 1776; San Juan Capistrano, 1776; Santa Clara, 1777; and San Buenaventura, 1782. He personally oversaw the planning, construction, and staffing of each of these, and conferred the sacraments. His work took him from Carmel to locations up and down the length of California. It\'s estimated that during this period he walked more than 24,000 mi in California visiting missions.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The missions comprised millions of acres and were in fact small self-sufficient cities with the church as the centerpiece. In addition to converting the Indians to Christianity and teaching them European ways, the padres managed farming, education, and industries such as candle making and tanning. San Diego is the southernmost mission, while the mission at Sonoma, San Francisco Solano, the last to be founded, in 1823, is the northernmost; each was established a day\'s walk—about 30 mi—from the previous one and was linked to El Camino Highway. The missions were the earliest form of lodging in the Golden State, known far and wide for the hospitality they afforded visitors.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Father Serra spent barely a year in San Diego before embarking on his journey to establish missions across California, but his presence left a lasting imprint. You can see some of the history at the Junípero Serra Museum and at Mission San Diego Alcalá. Within walking distance from Old Town, the Junípero Serra Museum at Presidio Hill displays furniture, housewares, and tools from the Native Americans, Spanish, and Mexicans through 1929. Also showcased at the museum is a historic cannon, salvaged from a sunken vessel at the bottom of San Diego Bay. You can trace the steps of Father Serra along El Camino Real by driving U.S. 101, the historic route that traverses coastal California from south to north.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">-Bobbi Zane</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Like</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beaches</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Locals stake out their favorite sunning, surfing, body boarding, and walking territories at the easily accessible North Coast beaches. Skilled surfers seeking a challenge head for Swami\'s Point in Encinitas. While dogs are welcome at several San Diego County beaches, many like to climb down to the water at Del Mar\'s James Scripps Bluff Preserve, where owners and canines can ride the San Dieguito River out to sea.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Desert Adventures</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Anza-Borrego Desert State Park encompasses more than 600,000 acres, most of it wilderness. Springtime, when the wildflowers are in full bloom, is glorious. In the sandstone canyons you can walk in the footsteps of prehistoric camels, zebras, and giant ground sloths.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dining</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fine dining, once limited to downtown San Diego, now goes beyond the city limits. At the top of foodies\' must-do list is Addison, Grand Del Mar Hotel\'s signature restaurant. Right behind it is the BlueFire Grill at La Costa Resort. Sure, some of the beach dives serving burgers and smoothies remain, as do some of the area\'s popular Mexican eateries where the fare is homemade. If you\'re looking for celebrity chefs, check out Pamplemousse, Addison, or Market Restaurant + Bar. Heading north, Temecula offers a variety of dining options ranging from the simple but satisfying Bank of Mexican Food to the artful Vineyard Rose.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Flowers</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The North County is a prolific flower-growing region. Nurseries, some open to the public, line the hillsides on both sides of I-5 in Encinitas, Leucadia, and Carlsbad. Most of the poinsettias sold in the United States get their start here. Quail Botanical Gardens in Encinitas displays native and exotic plants year-round. The gardens at the San Diego Wild Animal Park attract nearly as many people as the animals do.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lodging</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The North County is home to a growing number of luxury hotels, making it possible to enjoy the great outdoors in many places while pampering yourself indoors. Leading the list is the Four Seasons Aviara Resort, which occupies a storied vantage point overlooking the Pacific. The Casa del Zorro in the Anza-Borrego desert is a storied oasis of class and culture surrounded by desert scenery. For those who want the ultimate pampered vacation, the North County holds two world-class spas: Cal-A-Vie and the Golden Door. Bed-and-breakfast lodging rules in Julian, where you can relax in a country cabin or an historic house.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Two Good Balboa Park Walks</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\'s impossible to cover all the park\'s museums in one day, so choose your focus before you head out. To help maximize your time, rent one of the 60-minute audio headsets that guide you on a tour of the park\'s history, architecture, and horticulture. If your interests run to the aesthetic, the Museum of Photographic Arts, the San Diego Museum of Art, the Mingei International Museum, and the Timken Museum of Art should be on your list. Those with a penchant for natural and cultural history shouldn\'t miss the San Diego Natural History Museum and the Museum of Man; visitors oriented toward space and technology should see the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center, the San Diego Air and Space Museum, and the San Diego Automotive Museum. If you\'re traveling with kids, the National History Museum and the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center are musts, as is catching a show at the Marie Hitchcock Puppet Theater.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For a nice walk, enter the park via Cabrillo Bridge through the West Gate. Park south of the <b>Alcazar Garden</b>. It\'s a short stretch north across El Prado to the landmark California Building, modeled on a cathedral in Mexico and now home to the <b>San Diego Museum of Man</b>. Look up to see busts and statues of heroes of the early days of the state carved on the facade. Next door are the <b>Globe Theatres</b>, which adjoin the sculpture garden of the <b>San Diego Museum of Art</b>, an ornate Plateresque-style structure built to resemble the 17th-century University of Salamanca in Spain.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Continuing east you\'ll come to the <b>Timken Museum of Art</b>, the <b>Botanical Building</b>, and the Spanish colonial-style Casa del Prado, where the San Diego Floral Association has its offices and a gift shop.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the end of the row is the <b>San Diego Natural History Museum</b> ; you\'ll have to detour a block north to visit the <b>Spanish Village Art Center</b>. If you were to continue north, you would come to the <b>carousel</b>, the <b>miniature railroad</b>, and, finally, the entrance to the <b>San Diego Zoo</b>.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Return to the Natural History Museum and cross Fountain Plaza to reach the <b>Reuben H. Fleet Science Center</b>. (Beyond the parking lot to the south lies the <b>Centro Cultural de la Raza</b>. ) You\'re now on the opposite side of the Prado and heading west. You\'ll next pass <b>Casa de Balboa</b> ; inside are the model-railroad and photography museums and the historical society. Next door in the <b>House of Hospitality</b> is the Balboa Park Visitor Center, where you can buy a reduced-price pass to the museums, or dine at the Prado restaurant. Across the Plaza de Panama, the Franciscan mission-style <b>House of Charm</b> houses a folk art museum and a gallery for San Diego artists. Your starting point, the Alcazar Garden, is west of the House of Charm.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A second walk leads south from the Plaza de Panama, which doubles as a parking lot. The majority of the buildings along this route date from the 1935 fair, when the architecture of the Maya and native peoples of the Southwest was highlighted. The first sight you\'ll pass is the <b>Japanese Friendship Garden</b>. Next comes the ornate, crownlike <b>Spreckels Organ Pavilion</b>. The road forks here; veer to the left to reach the <b>House of Pacific Relations</b>, a Spanish mission-style cluster of cottages. Continue past the Balboa Park Club until you reach the Palisades Building, which hosts the <b>Marie Hitchcock Puppet Theater</b>. Just beyond is the <b>San Diego Automotive Museum</b>.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The road loops back at the spaceshiplike <b>San Diego Air and Space Museum</b>. As you head north again, you\'ll notice the Starlight Bowl, an amphitheater on your right. Next comes perhaps the most impressive structure on this tour, the Federal Building, the home of the <b>San Diego Hall of Champions</b>. Its main entrance was modeled after the Palace of Governors in the ancient Mayan city of Uxmal, Mexico. You\'ll now be back at the Spreckels Organ Pavilion, having walked a little less than a mile.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Once a location for filming Disney\'s <i>Zorro</i> TV series, the well-preserved mission, still owned by the Franciscans, was the 18th and largest and most prosperous of California\'s missions. The <i>sala</i> (parlor), the kitchen, a friar\'s bedroom, a weaving room, and a collection of religious art convey much about early mission life. Retreats are still held here, but a picnic area, a gift shop, and a museum (which has the most extensive collection of old Spanish vestments in the United States) are also on the grounds, as are sunken gardens and the <i>lavanderia,</i> the original open-air laundry area. Self-guided and docent-led tours are available. The mission\'s retreat center has limited, inexpensive dormitory-style overnight accommodations. www.sanluisrey.org. COST: $6. OPEN: Daily 10-4. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">LEGOLAND California</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">LEGOLAND California, the centerpiece of a development that includes resort hotels and a designer discount shopping mall, offers a full day of entertainment with more than 60 rides and attractions for pint-size fun-seekers and their parents. The mostly outdoor experience, which celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2009, is best appreciated by kids ages 2 to 12, who often beg to ride the mechanical horses around the Royal Joust again and again or to take just one more turn through the popular Volvo Jr. Driving School. Miniland USA, an animated collection of U.S. cities and other areas constructed entirely of LEGO bricks, captures the imaginations of all ages. Kids get a chance to dig for buried fossils on Dino Island, which holds the Dig Those Dinos paleontological play area as well as the Coastersaurus, a junior roller coaster. At the Fun Town Fire Academy, families compete at fire fighting by racing in a model fire truck and hosing down a simulated burning building. Also in Fun Town, besides the driving school, with miniature cars, is the Skipper School, with miniature boats. In Pirate Shores, kids cruise through pirate-infested waters past exploding volcanoes; Treasure Falls, a mini-flume log ride with a 12-foot soaking plunge; and Splash Battle, water-fight headquarters. Lost Kingdom Adventure, LEGOLAND\'S first dark ride (meaning indoors) and part of a new four-ride block, features the adventures of popular LEGO mini-figure Johnny Thunder battling the bad guys in an Egyptian temple with the help of riders using laser blasters to accumulate points and ultimately capture Sam Sinister and find the treasure. In 2009, the 128-acre park debuted the Egyptian-theme Dune Raiders, a 30-foot-high slide with six side-by-side racing lanes. Also part of the mix are stage shows and restaurants with kid-friendly buffets. www.legolandca.com. COST: $63, additional fees for some rides. OPEN: Hrs vary; call for information. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Maritime Museum</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A must for anyone with an interest in nautical history, this collection of six restored and replica ships affords a fascinating glimpse of San Diego during its heyday as a commercial seaport. The museum\'s headquarters are the <i>Berkeley,</i> an 1898 ferryboat moored at the foot of Ash Street. The steam-driven ship, which served the Southern Pacific Railroad in San Francisco until 1958, played its most important role during the great earthquake of 1906, when it saved thousands of people from the fires that had engulfed San Francisco. Its ornate carved-wood paneling, stained-glass windows, and plate-glass mirrors have been restored, and its main deck serves as a floating museum, with permanent exhibits on West Coast maritime history and complementary rotating exhibits.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you crave more than a dockside experience, you can take to the water in the museum\'s other sailing ship, the Californian, a replica of a 19th-century revenue cutter that patrolled the shores of California. Designated the state\'s official tall ship, it can be boarded for a variety of half- and full-day sails (weather permitting) on weekends. (Typically, weekday cruises are reserved for schoolchildren.) Tickets may be purchased online or at the museum on the day of sail. Full-day sails leave at 10 AM and half-day sails leave between 12:30 and 4:30 PM. They\'re most popular on sunny days, when it\'s recommended to show up at least one hour ahead of desired departure. www.sdmaritime.org. COST: $14 includes entry to all ships except the Californian. OPEN: Daily 9-8, until 9PMin summer. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">La Jolla Cove</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is one of the prettiest spots on the West Coast. A palm-lined park sits on top of cliffs formed by the incessant pounding of the waves. At low tide the tide pools and cliff caves provide a destination for explorers. Divers, snorkelers, and kayakers can explore the underwater delights of the San Diego-La Jolla Underwater Park Ecological Reserve. The cove is also a favorite of rough-water swimmers. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">SeaWorld San Diego</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the world\'s largest marine-life amusement parks, SeaWorld is spread over 189 tropically landscaped bayfront acres—and it seems to be expanding into every available square inch of space with new exhibits, shows, and activities. The biggest attraction in its 40 years of existence opened in 2004: <b>Journey to Atlantis</b> involves a cruise on an eight-passenger \"Greek fishing boat\" down a heart-stopping 60-foot plunge to explore a lost, sunken city. After this journey serenaded by dolphins calls, you view a 130,000-gallon pool, home to exotic Commerson\'s dolphins, a small black-and-white South American species known for speed and agility.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The majority of SeaWorld\'s exhibits are walk-through marine environments. Kids get a particular kick out of the <b>Shark Encounter,</b> where they come face-to-face with sandtiger, nurse, bonnethead, black-tipped, and white-tipped reef sharks by walking through a 57-foot clear acrylic tube that passes through the 280,000-gallon shark habitat. The hands-on <b>California Tide Pool</b> exhibit gives you a chance to get to know San Diego\'s indigenous marine life. At <b>Forbidden Reef</b> you can feed bat rays and go nose-to-nose with creepy moray eels. At <b>Rocky Point Preserve</b> you can view bottlenose dolphins, as well as Californian sea otters. At <b>Wild Arctic,</b> which starts out with a simulated helicopter ride to a research post at the North Pole, beluga whales, walruses, and polar bears can be viewed in areas decked out like the wrecked hulls of two 19th-century sailing ships. <b>Manatee Rescue</b> lets you watch the gentle-giant marine mammals cavorting in a 215,000-gallon tank. Various <b>freshwater and saltwater aquariums</b> hold underwater creatures from around the world. And for younger kids who need to release lots of energy, <b>Sesame Street Bay of Play at SeaWorld</b>, opened in 2008, is a hands-on fun zone that features three family-friendly Sesame Street-themed rides.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">SeaWorld\'s highlights are its large-arena entertainments. You can get front-row seats if you arrive 30 minutes in advance, and the stadiums are large enough for everyone to get a seat in the off-season. Introduced in 2006 and starring the ever-beloved Shamu the Killer Whale, <b>Believe</b> features synchronized whales and brings down the house. Another favorite is <i>Sesame Street Presents: Lights, Camera, Imagination!</i>in 4-D, a new film that has Cookie Monster, Elmo, and other Sesame Street favorites swimming through an imaginary ocean and flying through a cinematic sky. <b>Clyde and Seamore\'s Sea Lions LIVE,</b> the sea lion and otter production, also is widely popular.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Not all the shows are water-oriented. <b>Pets Rule!</b> showcases the antics of more common animals like dogs, cats, birds, and even a pig. One segment of the show actually has regular house cats climbing ladders and hanging upside down as they cross a high wire. The majority of the animals used in the show were adopted from shelters.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The Dolphin Interaction Program</b> gives guests the chance to interact with SeaWorld\'s bottlenose dolphins in the water. The 30-minute experience, during which visitors can feed, touch, and give behavior signals, costs $170. A less expensive treat ($36 adults, $19 children) is the <b>Dine With Shamu</b> package, which includes a buffet lunch or dinner and allows you the thrill of eating while the whales swim up to you or happily play nearby.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Shipwreck Rapids,</b> SeaWorld of San Diego\'s first adventure ride, offers plenty of excitement—but you may end up getting soaked. For five minutes, nine \"shipwrecked\" passengers careen down a river in a raftlike inner tube, encountering a series of obstacles, including several waterfalls. There\'s no extra charge, making this one of SeaWorld\'s great bargains—expect long lines. Those who want to head to higher ground might consider the <b>Skytower,</b> a glass elevator that ascends 265 feet; the views of San Diego County are especially spectacular in early morning and late evening. The <b>Bayside Skyride,</b> a five-minute aerial tram ride located on the west side of the park, travels across Mission Bay. Combined admission for the Skytower and the tram is $5. The fact that Anheuser-Busch is the park\'s parent company is evident in the presence of the beer company\'s signature Clydesdales, huge horses that you can visit in their \"hamlet\" when they\'re not putting on demonstrations.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The San Diego 3-for-1 Ticket ($115 for adults, $92 for children ages 3 to 9) offers five consecutive days of unlimited admission to SeaWorld, the San Diego Zoo, and the San Diego Wild Animal Park. This is a good idea, because if you try to get your money\'s worth by fitting everything in on a single day, you\'re likely to end up tired and cranky. Many hotels, especially those in the Mission Bay area, also offer SeaWorld specials that may include rate reductions or two days\' entry for the price of one. www.seaworld.com. COST: $65 adults, $55 kids; parking $12 cars, $8 motorcycles, $17 RVs and campers; 1-hr behind-the-scenes walking tours $12 extra. OPEN: Daily 10-dusk; extended hrs in summer. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hotel Del Coronado</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of San Diego\'s best-known sites, the hotel has been a National Historic Landmark since 1977. It has a colorful history, integrally connected with that of Coronado itself. The Del, as natives call it, was the brainchild of financiers Elisha Spurr Babcock Jr. and H. L. Story, who saw the potential of Coronado\'s virgin beaches and its view of San Diego\'s emerging harbor. The hotel opened in 1888, just 11 months after construction began.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Del\'s distinctive red-tile roofs and Victorian gingerbread architecture have served as a set for many movies, political meetings, and extravagant social happenings. It\'s speculated that the Duke of Windsor may have first met Wallis Simpson here. Eleven presidents have been guests of The Del, and the film <i>Some Like It Hot—</i>starring Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, and Tony Curtis—used the hotel as a backdrop.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Broad steps lead up to the main, balconied lobby, which is adorned with grand oak pillars and ceiling and opens out onto a central courtyard and gazebo. To the right is the cavernous <b>Crown Room,</b> whose arched ceiling of notched sugar pine was constructed without nails. A lavish Sunday brunch is served here from 9:30 to 2. During the holidays, the hotel hosts Skating by the Sea, an outdoor beachfront ice-skating rink open to the public.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The patio surrounding the swimming pool is a great place to sit back and imagine what the bathers looked like during the 1920s, when the hotel rocked with good times. To its right, the Windsor Lawn provides a green oasis between the hotel and the beach. To the pool\'s left are the seven-story Ocean Towers accommodations, built in the 1970s. The History Gallery displays photos from the Del\'s early days, and books elaborating on its history and that of Kate Morgan, the hotel\'s resident ghost, are sold along with logo apparel and gifts in the hotel\'s 15-plus shops. In early 2008 the Del unveiled $150 million in luxury enhancements, including 78 new cottages and villas, a signature restaurant, a wine room, and a spa. The resort recently published a new book titled <i>Building the Dream: The Design and Construction of the Hotel del Coronado.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tours of the Del are available Tuesday at 10:30 and Friday-Sunday at 2. Reservations are required through the <b>Coronado Visitor Center</b> (tel. 619/437-8788. www.coronadovisitorscenter.com) www.hoteldel.com. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Nab a little something for breakfast, then take the California line cable car uphill to Chinatown. Walk along Grant Avenue and Stockton Street, peeking into mysterious herb apothecaries, live-seafood stores, and sweet-smelling tea shops before having a dim sum lunch or a steamed-bun snack.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Then head to North Beach for an espresso and pastry at one of the classic outdoor cafés. The Italian delis, bakeries, and pasta houses are worth visiting even if you can\'t eat another bite. Get your appetite back by making your way uphill to Coit Tower for sweeping views of the bay. (Climbing the steep stairways is a tough but scenically stunning way to do this.)</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the end of the day, either head back to North Beach\'s Columbus Avenue and let one of the restaurant hawkers talk you into coming in for pasta, or make the trip to the Mission District for fantastic, inexpensive ethnic food.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Work the Wharf</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fisherman\'s Wharf and the surrounding attractions may be touristy with a capital T, but there are some fun experiences to be had. With your prereserved ticket in hand (do this in advance since tours frequently sell out), set out for Alcatraz. When the ferry docks back at Pier 33, head north along the waterfront to Pier 39. If you\'re on a kitschy-souvenir hunt, browse through the pier\'s overpriced stores. Otherwise, check out the hundreds of sea lions basking on floating platforms next to the pier. Take a step back in time to early-20th-century San Francisco at delightful Musée Mécanique, then grab an Irish coffee at the Buena Vista.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As tempting as it might be to dine on the water, most Fisherman\'s Wharf restaurants have less-than-spectacular food (Ana Mandara is an exception). A better and cheaper option is to pick up some to-go Dungeness crab from one of the outdoor vendors and eat as you stroll along the waterfront. Or hop the Powell-Hyde or Powell-Mason cable-car line for better dining in Russian Hill and North Beach, respectively.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art &amp; Retail Therapy</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Beat the crowds in the morning at SFMOMA (remember that it\'s closed Wednesday). The modern art collection is SoMa\'s main magnet, but there are several other museums to consider too, such as the San Francisco Craft and Folk Art Museum and the Museum of the African Diaspora. If you\'re here after spring 2008, be sure to size up the new Contemporary Jewish Museum.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Take a break from exhibits across the street from SFMOMA in the expansive Yerba Buena Gardens. If you have kids in tow, drop by Metreon. Otherwise, head up 4th Street and join the masses hitting the shops around Union Square. This area isn\'t known for great restaurants, so when you get peckish, head to Belden Place. This bistro-lined alley (many places here are closed Sunday) is one of the few places around Union Square where locals dine.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To top off the evening, gaze down on the city lights from one of the square\'s sky-view lounges like Harry Denton\'s Starlight Lounge.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Golden Gate Park</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Golden Gate Park is better than usual on Sunday, when its main arteries are closed to cars. Start your day at the glorious Conservatory of Flowers (closed Monday). Be sure to take in the scenes ingeniously rendered in flowers out front. Pace the wooden bridges and stone pathways of the Japanese Tea Garden before hitting the San Francisco Botanical Garden at Strybing Arboretum. Next up: the striking, controversial de Young Museum (closed Monday).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Make your way west, stopping at Stow Lake, where you can rent a boat and paddle near Strawberry Hill. Back on land, continue west toward Ocean Beach and the endless Pacific. Cap off your tour by kicking back with a pint to enjoy the sunset ocean view at the Beach Chalet.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Find the Funky Neighborhoods</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ride the antique trolleys to the western end of the F-line in the Castro. Stroll down Castro Street, past the art deco Castro Theatre, window-shopping and stopping at any café that tempts you. Head east on 16th Street to Dolores Street and Mission Dolores, and wander rows of centuries-old gravestones in its tiny cemetery.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Then hit the \"Valencia Corridor\" (Valencia Street between 16th and 24th streets), dipping into political bookstores, hipster cafés, and quirky shops. Seek out the area\'s vibrant, often politically charged murals, either on your own or on a tour with the Precita Eyes organization. Stay in the Mission for dinner and drinks; this is one of the city\'s best restaurant neighborhoods.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Take It to the Bridge</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Start with a stroll and a search for picnic supplies in the Marina, before heading to the gorgeous Palace of Fine Arts. If you\'re traveling with kids, be sure to visit the Exploratorium (closed Monday) next door. Don\'t miss its bizarre-but-cool Tactile Dome.</div><div>Continue west into the Presidio park and make for Crissy Field, the marshland and sandy beach along the northern shore, for your picnic. With the Golden Gate Bridge view to inspire you, head onto or over the bridge itself. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes; the bridge is 1.7 miles across. Save this for a sunny day—and don\'t forget your jacket!</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bay Views &amp; Real Estate Envy</h2><div>Start at terraced Ina Coolbrith Park on Russian Hill for broad vistas of the bay. Ascend the Vallejo Steps and you\'re within easy reach of many of Russian Hill\'s hidden lanes. Explore famous Macondray Lane; then head around the corner to Leavenworth Street just north of Union Street and look left for the steps to equally lovely but virtually unknown Havens Place. Continue north to zigzag down crooked Lombard Street. If you still have some stamina, head west to Pacific Heights, where you can check out the Haas-Lilienthal House, a Queen Anne treasure, and scads of other Victorians. Want to snap a picture of that iconic row of \"painted ladies\" with the city\'s skyline in the background? You\'ll need to head to Alamo Square in the Western Addition (Hayes and Steiner streets). Finally, head back to Hyde Street for dinner at one of Russian Hill\'s trendy eateries.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Top Walking Tours</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>All About Chinatown</b> (tel. 415/982-8839. www.allaboutchinatown.com). A delightful \"behind-the-scenes\" look at the neighborhood. Owner Linda Lee and her guides stop in Ross Alley and at a Buddhist temple. At herbal and food markets, you\'ll learn the therapeutic yield of fish stomachs and ponder uses for live partridges.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Chinatown Alleyway Tours</b> (tel. 415/984-1478. www.chinatownalleywaytours.org). To go beyond dim sum and learn about the modern Chinatown community, join up with one of these young guides.

Brush up on your noir slang and join trench-coated guide Herron for a walk by the mystery writer\'s haunts and the locations from some of Hammett\'s novels.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Foot! Comedy Walking Tours</b> (www.foottours.com). You\'ll likely find yourself breathless with laughter, not just gasping after a steep hill. The tour leaders are all moonlighting pro comedians; they\'ve got offerings like \"Nude, Lewd and Crude\" North Beach.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Local Tastes of the City Tours</b> (tel. 415/665-0480 or 888/358-8687. www.localtastesofthecitytours.com).

Along the way, you\'ll gradually gorge yourself into oblivion: the North Beach tour, for instance, might include multiple stops for coffee and baked goods.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Precita Eyes Mural Walks</b> (tel. 415/285-2287. www.precitaeyes.org). For an insider\'s look at the vibrant murals in the Mission District, this is the place to call. The nonprofit organization has nutured this local art form from the get-go and they stay on top of all the latest additions.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>San Francisco City Guides</b> (tel. 415/557-4266. www.sfcityguides.org). An outstanding free service supported by the San Francisco Public Library. Walking tour themes range from individual neighborhoods to local history (the Gold Rush, the 1906 quake, ghost walks) to architecture. Each May and October a slew of additional walks are added. Although the tours are free and the knowledgeable guides are volunteers, it\'s appropriate to make a $5 donation for these nonprofit programs. Tour schedules are available at library branches and the <b>San Francisco Visitor Information Center</b> (Hallidie Plaza, lower level, Powell and Market Sts., Union Sq.tel. 415/391-2000; 415/392-0328 TDD. www.sfvisitor.org).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Wok Wiz Chinatown Tour</b> (tel. 650/355-9657. www.wokwiz.com). Cookbook author Shirley Fong-Torres and her team lead these walks. Conversation topics include folklore and, of course, food. One version called \"I Can\'t Believe I Ate My Way Through Chinatown!\" includes breakfast and lunch.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Top Attractions</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Alcatraz</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Considering how many movies have been set here, you might feel like you\'ve already \"been there, done that\"—but you really shouldn\'t miss a trip to America\'s most infamous federal pen. Husky-throated onetime inmates and grizzled former guards bring the Rock to life on the wonderful audio tour; you\'ll hear yarns about desperate escape attempts and notorious crooks like Al Capone while you walk the cold cement cellblock. But it\'s not all doom and gloom: you\'ll enjoy stunning views of the city skyline on the ferry ride to and from the island.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Golden Gate Bridge</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">San Francisco\'s signature International Orange span is the city\'s majestic background, and about 10 million people a year head to the bridge for an up-close look. Walking the 1.7 mi to Marin County—inches from roaring traffic, steel shaking beneath your feet, and a far-too-low railing between you and the water 200 feet below—is much more than a superlative photo op (though it\'s that, too).</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fisherman\'s Wharf</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once part of a thriving fishing industry, Fisherman\'s Wharf has deteriorated into a giant harpoon aimed straight at your wallet. Throngs from all over the world come to watch the flopping, barking, or napping sea lions; buy cheap T-shirts; and chow down on overpriced, mediocre food. It\'s all an utter mystery to locals, who don\'t come here. Ever. See the magnificent historic ships at the Hyde Street Pier, then take your money and run.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Golden Gate Park</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It may be world famous, but first and foremost the park is the city\'s backyard. Come here any day of the week, and you\'ll find a microcosm of San Francisco, from the Russian senior citizens feeding the pigeons at Stow Lake to the moms pushing strollers through the botanical gardens to the arts boosters checking out the latest at the de Young Museum. Be sure to visit the park\'s iconic treasures, including the serene Japanese Tea Garden and the beautiful Victorian Conservatory of Flowers. If you have the time to venture further into this urban oasis, you\'ll discover less-accessible gems like the Beach Chalet and the wild western shores of Ocean Beach.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Palace of Fine Arts</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Perched on a swan-filled lagoon near the Marina\'s yacht harbor, this stirringly beautiful terra-cotta-color dome has an otherworldly quality about it. Built for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exhibition, the palace is a San Francisco architect\'s version of a Roman ruin, and it\'s been eliciting gasps for almost a century. Try to see it from the water.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Coit Tower</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most people assume that this stubby white tower atop Telegraph Hill is supposed to look like a fire hose. And considering that a fire truck-chasing, cross-dressing 19th-century socialite donated the funds to build it in honor of firefighters, maybe it is. The tower itself is of vague interest—it does house the history of San Francisco in murals—but the \"park\"(ing lot) at its base gives fantastic views of the city and the bay. The tower sits at the top of Telegraph Hill\'s Filbert Steps, a steep stairway through glorious gardens with vistas of transcendent beauty, an only-in-San Francisco spot locals cherish.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cable Cars</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You\'ve already seen them (on the big screen, in magazines, and, admit it, on the Rice-a-Roni ™ box). And considering a ticket costs $5 a pop, do you really need to ride a cable car? Yes, you do, at least once during your visit. Flag down a Powell-Hyde car along Powell Street, grab the pole, and clatter and jiggle up mansion-topped Nob Hill. Crest the hill, and hold on for the hair-raising descent to Fisherman\'s Wharf, with sun glittering off the bay and Alcatraz bobbing in the distance. Don\'t deny it—this would be a deal at twice the price.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">AT&amp;T Park</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the finest examples of modern \"retro\" ballparks, the Giants coastal digs are the perfect place to spend a sunny afternoon enjoying the national pastime. Grab a dog and some garlic fries, and revel in the bay views. If you\'re lucky, you\'ll get to see someone drill a splash hit into McCovey Cove.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ferry Building</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Foodies rejoice! The historic Ferry Building is stuffed to the brim with all things tasty, including cafés, restaurants, a farmers\' market, and merchants peddling everything from wine and olive oil to oysters and mushrooms. The building backs up to the bay, so the views are great—but they\'re even better from the decks of the departing ferries.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wine Country</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You don\'t need to be a connoisseur to enjoy a trip to Napa or Sonoma...or both (hey, you\'re on vacation). But there\'s more to a wine country visit than vineyard tours and tastings: landmark restaurants, breathtaking scenery, fantastic artwork, hot air balloon rides, and secluded boutique hotels. And when you\'re ready for a break, a great glass of wine is never that far out of reach.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Discovered by Spaniards in 1775 and declared a U.S. military reserve 75 years later, the island was used as a screening ground for Asian immigrants—who were often held for months, even years, before being granted entry—from 1910 until 1940. In 1963 the government designated Angel Island a state park. Today people come for picnics, hikes along the scenic 5-mi path that winds around the island\'s perimeter, and tram tours that explain the park\'s history. Twenty-five bicycles are permitted on the ferry on a first-come, first-served basis, and you can rent mountain bikes for $10 an hour or $30 a day at the landing (daily April-October; call during other times). There are also a dozen primitive campsites. Blue and Gold Fleet is the only Angel Island ferry service with departures from San Francisco. Boats leave Pier 41 weekdays at 10 and return at 4; on weekends they sail at 10:35 and return at 3:50 and 4:55. www.angelisland.org. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Golden Gate Bridge</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The suspension bridge that connects San Francisco with Marin County has long wowed sightseers with its simple but powerful art deco design. Completed in 1937 after four years of construction, the 2-mi span and its 750-foot towers were built to withstand winds of more than 100 mph. It\'s also not a bad place to be in an earthquake: designed to sway up to 27.7 feet, the Golden Gate Bridge, unlike the Bay Bridge, was undamaged by the 1989 Loma Prieta quake. (If you\'re on the bridge when it\'s windy, stand still and you can feel it swaying a bit.) Though it\'s frequently gusty and misty—always bring a jacket, no matter what the weather\'s like—the bridge provides unparalleled views of the Bay Area. Muni buses 28 and 29 make stops at the Golden Gate Bridge toll plaza, on the San Francisco side. However, drive to fully appreciate the bridge from multiple vantage points in and around the Presidio; you\'ll be able to park at designated areas.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the bridge\'s eastern-side walkway—the only side pedestrians are allowed on—you can take in the San Francisco skyline and the bay islands; look west for the wild hills of the Marin Headlands, the curving coast south to Land\'s End, and the Pacific Ocean. On sunny days, sailboats dot the water, and brave windsurfers test the often-treacherous tides beneath the bridge. A vista point on the Marin side gives you a spectacular city panorama.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">But there\'s a well-known, darker side to the bridge\'s story, too. The bridge is perhaps the world\'s most popular suicide platform, with an average of about 20 jumpers per year. (The first leaped just three months after the bridge\'s completion, and the official count was stopped in 1995 as the 1,000 jump approached.) Signs along the bridge read \"There is hope. Make the call,\" referring the disconsolate to the special telephones on the bridge. Bridge officers, who patrol the walkway and watch by security camera to spot potential jumpers, successfully talk down two-thirds to three-quarters of them each year. Documentary filmmaker Eric Steel\'s controversial 2006 movie <i>The Bridge</i> once again put pressure on the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District to install a suicide barrier. As of 2007, $2 million has been allocated for a study. www.goldengatebridge.org. OPEN: Pedestrians Mar.-Oct., daily 5 AM-9 PM; Nov.-Apr., daily 5 AM-6:30 PM; hrs change with daylight savings time. Bicyclists daily 24 hrs. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Alcatraz</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Thousands of visitors come every day to walk in the footsteps of Alcatraz\'s notorious criminals. The stories of life and death on \"the Rock\" may sometimes be exaggerated, but it\'s almost impossible to resist the chance to wander the cellblock that tamed the country\'s toughest gangsters and saw daring escape attempts of tremendous desperation. Fewer than 2,000 inmates ever did time on the Rock, and though they weren\'t the worst criminals, they were definitely the worst prisoners, include Al \"Scarface\" Capone, Robert \"The Birdman\" Stroud, and George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Some tips for escaping to Alcatraz: 1) Buy your ticket in advance. Visit the Web site for Alcatraz Cruises to scout out available departure times for the ferry. Prepay by credit card and keep a receipt record; the ticket price covers the boat ride and the audio tour. Pick up your ticket at the? will call? window at Pier 33 up to an hour before sailing. 2) Dress smart. Bring a jacket to ward off the chill from the boat ride and wear comfortable shoes. 3) Go for the evening tour. You?ll get even more out of the experience if you do it at night. The evening tour has programs not offered during the day, the bridge-to-bridge view of the city twinkles at night, and your? prison experience? will be amplified as darkness falls. 4) Be mindful of scheduled and limited capacity talks. Some programs only happen once a day (the schedule is posted in the cell house). Certain talks have limited capacity seating, so keep an eye out for a cell house staffer handing out passes shortly before the start time.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The boat ride to the island is brief (15 minutes) but affords beautiful views of the city, Marin County, and the East Bay. The audio tour, highly recommended, includes observations by guards and prisoners about life in one of America\'s most notorious penal colonies. Plan your schedule to allow at least three hours for the visit and boat rides combined. www.nps.gov/alca, www.parkconservancy.org/visit/alcatraz, www.alcatrazcruises.com.

With less than 0.03% of the planet\'s surface, it is home to some 875 bird species, more than the United States and Canada combined. Some stay year-round; others come and go with winter migration.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Caño Negro, Northern Plains.</b> Waterfowl, such as jabiru and snail kites, are abundant.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Carara National Park, Central Pacific.</b> Scarlet macaws are reliable sightings, as are great egrets, boat-billed herons, anhingas, and trogons.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Cerro de La Muerte, South Pacific.</b> This is probably the best place in the country to spot a resplendent quetzal.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Corcovado National Park, South Pacific.</b> The largest population of (endangered) scarlet macaws in the country lives here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>La Selva Biological Station, Northern Plains.</b> If you\'re interested in (but totally clueless about) bird-watching, sign up in advance for the Birdwatching 101 course.

There\'s even better news: that popularity hasn\'t yet translated into overcrowding. Most surfers bring their own boards, as evidenced by the crowds that get off the plane and make a beeline for the oversize luggage carousel, but you\'ll find plenty of places to rent equipment if you\'re not quite that hardcore.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Jacó, Central Pacific.</b> Easily accessible Jacó draws the many surfers who come here as much for the partying as the waves.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Pavones, South Pacific.</b> It\'s a long trip here, but your reward is one of the world\'s longest left-breaking waves.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, Caribbean.</b> One of the world\'s best (and toughest) waves, Salsa Brava, laps right offshore in town.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Tamarindo, North Pacific.</b> The north coast\'s consummate surfing town and a good place for beginners; the stretch of shoreline north to Playa Grande and south to Playa Negra satisfies experts.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">White-Water Adventures</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Insanely steep hills and heavy rainfall make the country a mecca for white-water sports, and there\'s a level of ease or difficulty to match anyone\'s expertise (or lack thereof).

For you, that means more advance planning, some flexibility in choosing a hotel, and higher prices. Afternoon showers kick in by May and last through November most everywhere, with a brief dry season in June and July. The Caribbean coast flies in the face of these norms with rains spread out fairly evenly throughout the year, with brief <i>drier</i> seasons February through April and September through October. Costa Rica promotes the rainy season as the \"green season,\" touting lush vegetation, smaller crowds, and lower prices. Showers interrupt your afternoon beach time and remote roads can be washed out during the worst of the rains.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Temperatures generally range between 70°F (20°C) and 85°F (30°C). It\'s the humidity, not the heat, that causes you discomfort, especially in the dense forest of the Caribbean coast, the northern lowlands, and the Osa Peninsula. The arid North Pacific is Costa Rica\'s hottest region, with temperatures frequently exceeding 90°F (33°C) in the dry season.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One final point: We typically hear, \"I didn\'t realize the rain forest would be so…<i>rainy.</i>\" Well, you heard it here: it rains often and heartily in the rain forest. The dense foliage and elaborate root systems rely on frequent showers year-round.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.  All rights reserved.</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(1816,'<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Manuel Antonio</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Good things come in small packages. Case in point, Manuel Antonio National Park, a small park that packs in an impressive collection of natural attractions: lots of wildlife, rain forest, white-sand beaches, coral reefs, and rocky coves with abundant marine life. Trails are short, well maintained, and easy to walk. The forest is dominated by massive ficus and gumbo-limbo trees, and is home to two- and three-toed sloths, green and black iguanas, aguotis, four species of monkeys, and nearly 200 species of birds.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Make no mistake about it: Manuel Antonio is no undiscovered wilderness. It\'s one of Costa Rica\'s most-visited attractions, so if you\'re looking for an undisturbed natural oasis, this is not it. But what Manuel Antonio <i>does</i> have is great diversity of wildlife, all easily spotted from the well-marked trails. And because animals are so used to humans, this is one of the best places to see them up close.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the ranger station a trail leads through the rain forest behind <b>Playa Espadilla Sur,</b> the park\'s longest beach. It\'s also the least crowded because the water can be rough. Riptides are brutal at Playa Espadilla when the surf is up; more than a few unsuspecting tourists have been swept away. Snorkeling, however, is good in the tidal pools. The coral reefs and submerged volcanic rocks of whitesand <b>Playa Manuel Antonio</b> also make for good snorkeling. The 1/2-mile-long beach, tucked into a deep cove, is safe for swimming. At low tide you can see the remains of a Quepos Indian turtle trap on the right-the Quepos stuck poles in the semicircular rock formation, which trapped turtles as the tide receded. Olive ridley and green turtles come ashore on this beach May through November. Espadilla and Manuel Antonio beaches lie on opposite sides of a tombolo, or a sandy strip that connects the mainland to <b>Punta Catedral</b> (Cathedral Point), which used to be an island. The steep path that leads up Punta Catedral\'s rocky hill draped with thick jungle, passes a lookout point from which you can gaze over the Pacific at the park\'s islands. Theft is a problem on the beaches; don\'t leave your belongings unattended while you swim and don\'t leave anything of value in your car.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Farther east, <b>Playa Escondido</b> (Hidden Beach) is rocky and secluded, but it\'s also more difficult to access. Before you head out to Escondido, find out when the tides come in so you\'re not stranded. <b>Playa Playita</b>,south of Escondido, is Costa Rica\'s only nude beach, though unofficially so. It also tends to be a favorite of gay sun-seekers. It\'s quiet and secluded. Kayaking trips might take you down to <b>Punta Serrucho</b> near the southern border of the park, whose jagged peaks explain its name. (Serrucho means \"saw.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Trails</b> from the entrance to Punta Catedral and Playa Manuel Antonio are in good shape. Trails farther east to Escondido and Playita are progressively rougher going. COST: $7. OPEN: Tues.-Sun. 7-4. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Tortuguero National Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The palm-lined beaches of Parque Nacional Tortuguero stretch off as far as the eye can see, and its additional ecosystems include lowland rain forest, estuaries, and swampy areas covered with <i>Jolillo</i> palms. You can wander the beach independently, but riptides make swimming dangerous, and shark rumors persist. At various times of the year, Green, Hawksbill, Loggerhead, and Giant Leatherback Turtles lumber up the 36 km (22 mi) of beach and deposit their eggs for safekeeping—a fascinating natural ritual. If you want to watch the <i>deshove</i> (the egg laying), contact your hotel or the parks office to hire a certified local guide. One must accompany you on turtle-watching excursions. Note that you won\'t be allowed to use a camera on the beach, and that only your guide is permitted to use a flashlight and it must be covered with red plastic, as lights can deter the turtles from nesting. As the signs around town admonish you regarding the turtles: \"Don\'t become another predator.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Freshwater turtles inhabit Tortuguero\'s rivers, as do crocodiles—most populous in the Río Agua Frío—and the endangered <i>vacas marinas,</i> or manatees. Manatees consume huge quantities of aquatic plants and are endangered mainly because their lack of speed makes them easy prey. You might also glimpse tapirs (watch for these in Jolillo groves), jaguars, anteaters, ocelots, howler monkeys, Collared and White-lipped Peccaries, raccoons, otters, skunks, and coatis. Some 350 species of birds and countless butterflies, including the iridescent Blue Morpho, also call this area home. At a station deep in the Tortuguero jungle, volunteers from the Canadian Organization for Tropical Education and Rainforest Conservation manage a butterfly farm, catalog plants and animals, and explore sustainable forest practices. COST: $7. OPEN: Daily 6-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Playa Carrillo</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With its long, reef-protected beach backed by an elegant line of swaying palms and sheltering cliffs, Playa Carrillo (interchangeably called Puerto Carrillo) is a candidate for the most picturesque beach in Costa Rica. Unmarred by a single building, it\'s ideal for swimming, snorkeling, walking, and lounging—just remember not to sit under a loaded coconut palm. There are some concrete tables and benches, but they get snapped up quickly. The main landmark here is the Hotel Guanamar, high above the beach. Unfortunately the former private fishing club and previously grand hotel has been bought and sold so often that its charm has faded. But its bar still has the best view. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

In 1508 Ponce de León established a settlement and became the first governor; in 1521 he founded what is known as Old San Juan. For centuries, while Africans worked on the coastal sugarcane fields, the French, Dutch, and English tried unsuccessfully to wrest the island from Spain. In 1898, as a result of the Spanish-American War, Spain ceded the island to the United States. In 1917 Puerto Ricans became U.S. citizens, and in 1952 Puerto Rico became a semiautonomous commonwealth.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Since the 1950s, Puerto Rico has developed exponentially, as witnessed in the urban sprawl, burgeoning traffic, and growing population (estimated at nearly 4 million); yet, <i>en la isla</i> (on the island) a strong Latin sense of community and family prevails. Puertorriqueños are fiercely proud of their unique blend of heritages.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Music is another source of Puerto Rican pride. Like wildflowers, <i>velloneras</i> (jukeboxes) pop up almost everywhere, and when one is playing, somebody will be either singing or dancing along—or both. Cars often vibrate with <i>reggaetón,</i> a hard, monotonous beat with lyrics that express social malaise. Salsa, a fusion of West African percussion, jazz, and other Latin beats, is the trademark dance. Although it may look difficult to master, it\'s all achieved by just loosening your hips. You may choose to let your inhibitions go by doing some clubbing <i>a la vida loca</i> made famous by pop star Ricky Martin. Nightlife options are on par with any cosmopolitan city—and then some.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">By day you can drink in the culture of the old world; one of the richest visual experiences in Puerto Rico is Old San Juan. Originally built as a fortress by the Spaniards in the early 1500s, the Old City has myriad attractions that include restored 16th-century buildings and 200-year-old houses with balustraded balconies of filigreed wrought iron that overlook narrow cobblestone streets. Spanish traditions are also apparent in the countryside festivals celebrated in honor of small-town patron saints. For quiet relaxation or experiences off the beaten track, visit coffee plantations, colonial towns, or outlying islets where nightlife is virtually nonexistent.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">And of course you don\'t come to a Caribbean island without taking in some of the glorious sunshine and natural wonders. In the coastal areas, the sun mildly toasts your body, and you\'re immediately healed by soft waves and cool breezes. In the misty mountains, you can wonder at the flickering night flies and the star-studded sky while the <i>coquís</i> (tiny local frogs) sing their legendary sweet lullaby. On a moonless night, watch the warm ocean turn into luminescent aqua-blue speckles on your skin. Then there are the island\'s many acres of golf courses, numerous tennis courts, rain forests, and dozens of beaches that offer every imaginable water sport.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Peaceful Music</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cellist Pablo Casals was one of the 20th century\'s most influential musicians. Born in Catalonia in 1876, he studied in Spain and Belgium, settled for a time in Paris, then returned to Barcelona. Tours in Europe, the United States, and South America brought him artistic and financial success and opportunities to collaborate with other prominent musicians.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">By the advent of the Spanish Civil War, he was an internationally famous musician, teacher, and conductor. He was also an outspoken supporter of a democratic Spain. Forced into exile by Franco\'s regime, Casals arrived in Puerto Rico, his mother\'s birthplace, in 1956. There, the 81-year-old maestro continued to work and teach. He established the Casals Festival of Classical Music, making it a home for sublime orchestral and chamber works. For two weeks each June, the Puerto Rico Symphony Orchestra is joined by musicians from all over the world.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In Catalan, Casals first name is \"Pau,\" which appropriately enough means \"peace.\" He and his friend Albert Schweitzer appealed to the world powers to stop the arms race, and he made what many experts say is his greatest work—an oratorio titled \"The Manger\"—his personal message of peace. Casals died in Puerto Rico in 1973, but his many legacies live on. His favorite instruments, his recordings, and some of his many awards are preserved at the Museo Pablo Casals in Old San Juan.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">—Karen English</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Many of the works on display have strong political messages, including pointed commentaries on the island\'s status as a commonwealth. Only a small part of the permanent collection is on display at any time, but it might be anything from an exhibit of ceramics to a screening of videos. www.museocontemporaneopr.org. COST: Free.

The beautiful neoclassical building, dating from the 1920s, proved to be too small to house the museum\'s permanent collection of Puerto Rican art dating from the 17th century to the present. The solution was to build a new east wing, which is dominated by a five-story-tall stained-glass window, the work of local artist Eric Tabales. The collection starts with works from the colonial era, most of them commissioned for churches. Here you can find works by José Campeche, the island\'s first great painter. His <i>Immaculate Conception,</i> finished in 1794, is a masterpiece. Also well represented is Francisco Oller y Cestero, who was the first to move beyond religious subjects to paint local scenes. His influence is still felt today. A gallery on the top floor is filled with works by artists inspired by Oller. www.mapr.org. COST: $6.

Its white sands skirt a mile-long, crescent-shape bay. You\'ll find food kiosks, picnic tables, and changing facilities. On weekdays, when the crowds are thin, you might also find wild horses grazing among the palm trees. COST: Parking $3. OPEN: Daily dawn-dusk. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Vieques</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This island off Puerto Rico\'s east coast is famed for its Playa Sun Bay, a gorgeous stretch of sand with picnic facilities and shade trees. In May 2003, the U.S. Navy withdrew from its military operations and turned over two-thirds of Vieques to the local government, which is transforming it into the Vieques National Wildlife Refuge. Vieques has two communities—Isabel Segunda, where the ferries dock, and the smaller Esperanza. Both have restaurants and hotels that will surprise you with their sophistication.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In addition to great beaches, Vieques has one attraction that draws visitors from all over the world. <b>Bahía Mosquito</b> (Mosquito Bay) is best experienced on moonless nights, when millions of bioluminescent organisms glow when disturbed—it\'s like swimming in a cloud of fireflies. If you\'re on the island, this is a not-to-be-missed experience. Several local companies lead trips to the bay, either by kayak or by nonpolluting electric boats. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">El Yunque</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">More than 28,000 acres of verdant foliage and rare wildlife make up El Yunque, the only rain forest within the U.S. National Forest system. Formally known as the El Yunque National Forest, El Yunque\'s odd name is believed to be derived from the Taíno word <i>yukiyú</i> (good spirit), although some people say it comes directly from <i>yunque,</i> the Spanish word for \"anvil,\" because some of the forest\'s peaks have flattened tops. More than 100 billion gallons of precipitation fall here annually, spawning rushing streams and cascades, 240 tree species, and oversize impatiens and ferns. In the evening, millions of inch-long <i>coquís</i> (tree frogs) begin their calls. El Yunque is also home to the <i>cotorra,</i> Puerto Rico\'s endangered green parrot, as well as 67 other types of birds.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The forest\'s 13 hiking trails are well maintained; many of them are easy to walk and less than a mile long. Before you begin exploring, check out the high-tech interactive displays—explaining rain forests in general and El Yunque in particular—at <b>El Portal</b> (Rte. 191, Km 4.3, 00745. tel. 787/888-1880. www.fs.fed.us/r8/el_yunque), the information center near the northern entrance. This is also a good place to pick up a map of the park and talk to rangers about weather conditions or which trails are open. You can also stock up on water, snacks, film, and souvenirs at the small gift shop. The center is open daily from 9 to 4:30; admission is $3. The park itself, which is free, is open daily 7:30 to 6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fuerte San Felipe del Morro</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On a rocky promontory at the northwestern tip of the Old City is El Morro (which translates as \"promontory\"), a fortress built by the Spaniards between 1540 and 1783. Rising 140 feet above the sea, the massive six-level fortress covers enough territory to accommodate a nine-hole golf course. It\'s a labyrinth of dungeons, ramps, barracks, turrets, towers, and tunnels. Built to protect the port, El Morro has a commanding view of the harbor. You\'re free to wander throughout. The cannon emplacement walls are thick as a child\'s arm is long, and the dank secret passageways are a wonder of engineering. The history of the fortress can be traced in its museum. Tours and a video show are available in English. www.nps.gov/saju. COST: $3, $5 includes admission to Fuerte San Cristóbal.

The brief glossary that follows explains terms used frequently in this book.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Art &amp; Architecture</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Adobe:</b> A brick of sun-dried earth and clay, usually stabilized with straw; a structure made of adobe.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Banco:</b> A small bench, or banquette, often upholstered with handwoven textiles, that gracefully emerges from adobe walls.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Bulto:</b> Folk-art figures of a santo (saint), usually carved from wood.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Camposanto:</b> A graveyard.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Capilla:</b> A chapel.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Casita:</b> Literally \"small house,\" this term is generally used to describe a separate guesthouse.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Cerquita:</b> A spiked, wrought-iron, rectangular fence, often marking grave sites.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Coyote fence:</b> A type of wooden fence that surrounds many New Mexico homes; it comprises branches, usually from cedar or aspen trees, arranged vertically and wired tightly together.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Farolito:</b> Small votive candles set in paper-bag lanterns, farolitos are popular at Christmastime. The term is used in northern New Mexico only. People in Albuquerque and points south call the lanterns <i>luminarias,</i> which in the north is the term for the bonfires of Christmas Eve.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Heishi:</b> Shell jewelry.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Hornos:</b> Outdoor domed ovens.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Kiva:</b> A ceremonial room, rounded and built at least partially underground, used by Native Americans of the Southwest.

Other characteristics are flat roofs, thick adobe or stucco walls, small windows, rounded corners, and viga beams.</div><div><b>Retablo:</b> Holy image painted on wood or tin.</div><div><b>Santero:</b> Maker of religious images.</div><div><b>Terrones adobes:</b> Adobe cut from the ground rather than formed from mud.</div><div><b>Viga:</b> Horizontal roof beam made of logs, usually protruding from the side of the house.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rethinking Santa Fe Style</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In Santa Fe, everything from the ancient Palace of the Governors to today\'s Walgreens is clad in adobe and designed in the Pueblo Revival or Spanish colonial tradition. Picturesque and charming, this look is not, however, necessarily all that authentic: it dates from the early 20th century, at least as it applies to architecture and urban planning.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Around 1920, less than a decade after New Mexico attained statehood, the city\'s leaders decided that they could enhance Santa Fe\'s image, and promote tourism, by instituting urban planning guidelines calling for all new construction in the adobe style. At that time, the Plaza and the blocks around it contained a mix of Italianate, Queen Anne, and other Victorian styles, mixed with Spanish colonial, and Pueblo Revival buildings.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Some lament that Santa Fe is too uniform, and that the degree to which the city enforces the Santa Fe style verges on the ridiculous. If Santa Fe is going to allow strip malls and tract developments, albeit, thankfully, several miles from the historic district, shouldn\'t the developers be permitted to design them as they please?</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Others argue that Santa Fe, along with much of northern New Mexico\'s Rio Grande Valley, must rigorously preserve its style, even if it wasn\'t codified until the 20th century. Aesthetically and architecturally, this part of the country enjoys a singular appearance. The region\'s buildings may look similar, but they look nothing at all like buildings elsewhere. Besides, an urban design theme developed in the 1920s, based on regional building traditions of the prior few centuries, can legitimately be called historic at this point.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although city planners began encouraging a unified style from the 1920s onward, officially, Santa Fe adopted its Historic Zoning Ordinance in 1957. Today, the city\'s Historic Design Review Board checks that all new development fits within these particular guidelines, and that developers conduct a historical study of the surrounding area before embarking on any new construction.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Regardless of how far back you trace Santa Fe style, the look of the city and the Rio Grande Valley\'s other communities preserves a distinct amalgam of indigenous, Spanish, and Western architectural traditions. We owe the concept of earthen walls and flat roofs to the region\'s many centuries of Pueblo Indians, although it was the Spaniards who perfected building with adobe bricks. An increase in trade with U.S. states in the 19th century brought a greater variety of materials to the region, leading to an increasing use of timber and metal in building construction. This led to the development of an architectural style unique to the Southwest, Territorial, which combines American Victorian, frontier, Spanish colonial, and—to a lesser degree—Pueblo Indian design elements.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For a more thorough examination of Santa Fe\'s design aesthetic and how it has evolved, take a look at Chris Wilson\'s book, <i>The Myth of Santa Fe: Creating a Modern Regional Tradition.</i></div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The chapel sits above a sacred <i>pozito</i> (a small hole), the dirt from which is believed to have miraculous healing properties. Dozens of abandoned crutches and braces placed in the anteroom—along with many notes, letters, and photos—testify to this. The Santuario draws a steady stream of worshippers year-round—Chimayó is considered the Lourdes of the Southwest. During Holy Week as many as 50,000 pilgrims come here. The shrine is a National Historic Landmark, and its altar and artwork underwent an ambitious and much-needed restoration in 2004. It\'s surrounded by small adobe shops selling every kind of religious curio imaginable, and some very fine traditional Hispanic work from local artists. www.archdiocesesantafe.org/AboutASF/Chimayo.html.

The sandstone rock formations look like stacked tents in a stark, water- and wind-eroded box canyon. Located 45 minutes south of Santa Fe, near Cochiti Pueblo, Tent Rocks offers excellent hiking year-round, although it can get hot in summer, when you should bring extra water. The drive to this magical landscape is equally awesome, as the road heads west toward Cochiti Dam and through the cottonwood groves around the pueblo. It\'s a good hike for kids. The round-trip hiking distance is only 2 mi, about 1½ hours, but it\'s the kind of place where you\'ll want to hang out for a while. Take a camera. There are no facilities here, just a small parking area with a posted trail map and a self-pay admission box; you can get gas and pick up picnic supplies and bottled water at Cochiti Lake Convenience Store. www.nm.blm.gov. COST: $5 per vehicle. OPEN: Apr.-Oct., daily 7-7; Nov.-Mar., daily 8-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museum of Spanish Colonial Art</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Opened in 2002, this 5,000-square-foot adobe museum occupies a building designed in 1930 by acclaimed architect John Gaw Meem. The Spanish Colonial Art Society formed in Santa Fe in 1925 to preserve traditional Spanish-colonial art and culture. The museum, which sits next to the Museum of New Mexico complex, displays the fruits of the society\'s labor—one of the most comprehensive collections of Spanish colonial art in the world. The Hale Matthews Library contains a 1,000-volume collection of books relating to this important period in art history. Objects here, dating from the 16th century to the present, include retablos, elaborate santos, tinwork, straw appliqué, furniture, ceramics, and ironwork. There\'s also a fine collection of works by Hispanic artists of the 20th century. www.spanishcolonial.org.

Remnants of one of the most impressive of them can be seen at <b>Frijoles Canyon</b> in Bandelier National Monument. At the canyon\'s base, near a gurgling stream, are the remains of cave dwellings, ancient ceremonial kivas, and other stone structures that stretch out for more than a mile beneath the sheer walls of the canyon\'s tree-fringed rim. For hundreds of years the ancestral Puebloan people, relatives of today\'s Rio Grande Pueblo Indians, thrived on wild game, corn, and beans. Suddenly, for reasons still undetermined, the settlements were abandoned.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Wander through the site on a paved, self-guided trail. Steep wooden ladders and narrow doorways lead you to the cave dwellings and cell-like rooms. There is one kiva in the cliff wall that is large, and tall enough to stand in.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bandelier National Monument, named after author and ethnologist Adolph Bandelier (his novel <i>The Delight Makers</i> is set in Frijoles Canyon), contains 23,000 acres of backcountry wilderness, waterfalls, and wildlife. Sixty miles of trails traverse the park. A small museum in the visitor center focuses on the area\'s prehistoric and contemporary Native American cultures, with displays of artifacts from 1200 to modern times as well as displays on the forest fires that have devastated parts of the park in recent years. There is a small café in the wonderful, 1930s CCC-built stone visitors complex. It is worth getting up early to get here when there are still shadows on the cliff walls because the petroglyphs are fantastic and all but disappear in the bright light of the afternoon. If you are staying in the area, ask about the night walks at the visitor center, they\'re stellar! Pets are not allowed on any trails. www.nps.gov/band/index.htm. COST: $12 per vehicle, good for 7 days. OPEN: Late May-early Sept., daily 8-6; early Sept.-Oct. and Apr.-late May, daily 8-5:30; Nov.-Mar., daily 8-4:30. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">San Miguel Mission</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The oldest church still in use in the United States, this simple earth-hue adobe structure was built in the early 17th century by the Tlaxcalan Indians of Mexico, who came to New Mexico as servants of the Spanish. Badly damaged in the 1680 Pueblo Revolt, the structure was restored and enlarged in 1710. On display in the chapel are priceless statues and paintings and the San José Bell, weighing nearly 800 pounds, which is believed to have been cast in Spain in 1356. In winter the church sometimes closes before its official closing hour. Mass is held on Sunday at 5 PM. Next door in the back of the Territorial-style dormitories of the old St. Michael\'s High School, a <b>Visitor Information Center</b> can help you find your way around northern New Mexico. COST: $1.

Recently completed, a multimillion dollar renovation is ingenious, with dioramas, a Carnaval costume display, and statues of the heroes done in a bronze-look-alike composition. Although it began its life as a monument to the dictator Trujillo, when it was erected in the 1940s, the government changed the name and focused on Trujillo\'s assassination, rededicating it to those heroes who died between 1863 and 1865 in the war to free the country from Spain. In the lovely park that surrounds the monument, the same kind of sculptures sit whimsically on park benches. COST: Free.

In the evening, you could see a movie at the nearby Espaço Unibanco, or try one of the Italian restaurants in Bixiga, the Italian neighborhood, near the start of Avenida Paulista. Head to Centro on the second day to see such landmarks as <b>Edifício Martinelli</b> and <b>Teatro Municipal</b>. Don\'t miss the Latin crafts exhibit at the <b>Memorial da América Latina,</b> northwest of Centro. On the third day, head for <b>Parque Ibirapuera</b> to visit one of its museums or just relax under the trees. After that, you can try one of the bars in nearby Itaim or Vila Olímpia to see how paulistas enjoy their happy hour.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 5 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In addition to the attractions outlined in the three-day itinerary, take a day to visit the snake museum at Instituto Butantã at the <b>Universidade de São Paulo</b> and/or the <b>Fundação Maria Luisa e Oscar Americano</b>. These sights are far from one another; it\'s best to get a cab. You can go by bus, but it\'s slow going. In the evening, get a drink at one of Vila Madalena\'s bars; here you can see a part of the city\'s exciting nightlife. On your last day, tour <b>Museu do Ipiranga</b> and its environs, where Brazil\'s independence was declared. Afterward, walk by Liberdade neighborhood to see the Japanese shops and have dinner at one of the local restaurants.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Top Reasons to Go</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">People come from all over Brazil and South America to shop in São Paulo. Go to Jardins or Itaim if you want to stroll on the streets among the rich and famous, or find a shopping mall to buy leather items, jewelry, gifts, antiques, or art.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Eating Out</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">More than 12,000 restaurants fill this melting pot of cultures, including the country\'s best Japanese, Italian, pizzerias, and cafés. Also excellent are Portuguese, German, French, Spanish, and traditional Brazilian restaurants. Don\'t miss the extravaganza of restaurants, food stands, and grocery items at historic Mercado Municipal.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dance Clubs &amp; Live Music</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city\'s eclectic heritage is reflected in its nightlife. São Paulo is one of the few places in Brazil where you can dance to throbbing techno music even after the sun comes up, lose yourself into one of the many rock joints around town and hear live MPB (Brazilian popular music), jazz, and blues acts, all on the same night. The entertainment is 24/7—guaranteed.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bars</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bars in Brazil are much more than a place to grab a drink. People go to barzinhos (little bars), as locals call them, to spend the whole night talking, people-watching, discussing politics or soccer and, of course, having a caipirinha. In São Paulo, you can choose between the upscale bars of Jardins and the young-oriented (and always crowded) of Vila Madalena.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Soccer</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you love the beautiful game, why not spend some time in São Paulo watching the best soccer in Brazil? Games are played year-round in the major stadiums of the city. Choose your home team from the popular Corinthians, the elitist São Paulo, and the Italian-based Palmeiras. If you like the underdogs, go to Móoca and cheer for Juventus while eating a cannoli on their home turf.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Baroque sculptor Aleijadinho, expressionist painter Lasar Segall, and expressionist/surrealist painter Cândido Portinari are three of the many Brazilian artists represented.

For example, the Stephen Williams House, now restored as an elegant B&amp;B, was named for its builder, Stephen Williams, rather than the owner, William Thorn Williams, six-time mayor of Savannah. Some houses are named for the first owner and then a subsequent owner, like the Green-Meldrim House. The good news is that they didn\'t add the name Sherman—General William T. Sherman, that is, who occupied the house during \"The War\" from 1864-1865—to the Green-Meldrim House\'s name.

The carriage house includes a gift shop and rare urban slave quarters, which have retained the original furnishings and \"haint-blue\" paint made by the slave occupants.

Perhaps not, but the Emerald City, particularly because of its proximity to so much water, will embrace the interests of several age groups. Here are our top seven sights for kids in the city.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The Children\'s Museum.</b> A Northwest wilderness motif sets the stage for this eminently kid-friendly space in the Queen Anne neighborhood. The highlight: Cog City, a giant game of pipes and pulleys.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Odyssey Maritime Discovery Center.</b> On the waterfront in Belltown, this facility has hands-on exhibits that include kayaking over computer-generated waters.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Seattle Aquarium.</b> This downtown aquarium should call itself Otters R Us—you could spend hours just watching the delightful antics of the sea otters and their river cousins.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture.</b> Dinosaur skeletons. Okay? It\'s one big reason kids will enjoy this sojourn to the University District.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Gasworks Park.</b> A hungry lake of ducks and a sand-bottom playground are two ways to amuse the kids at this Fremont gem.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Woodland Park Zoo.</b> Animals aplenty and stroller-friendly flat terrain make this Phinney Ridge oasis a family pleaser.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Pike Place Market.</b> Sure, it\'s crowded, but the frenzy of this downtown institution is appropriate—and memorable for all ages.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Seattle Itineraries</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though Seattle\'s not always the easiest city to get around in, it\'s small enough that you can see a great deal of it in a week. If you\'ve only got a long weekend in the Emerald City, you can easily mix and match any of the days in the itinerary to suit your interests.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Before you explore, you\'ll need three things: comfortable walking shoes, layered clothing, and a flexible mindset. It\'s easy to get off-track in this fascinating city and linger in its residential neighborhoods or at one of its parks. If you end up throwing your itinerary out the window at any point, don\'t sweat it—it\'s just Seattle\'s laid-back nature rubbing off on you for the better.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Day 1:</b> Spend the first day seeing some of major sights around Downtown. Get up early and stroll to Pike Place Market. Grab a latte or have a hearty breakfast at a market café, and spend the morning wandering through the fish, fruit, flower, and crafts stalls. When you\'ve had your fill of the market, head farther Downtown to the Seattle Art Museum or take the steps down to the docks and visit the Seattle Aquarium. Stop at a simple restaurant like El Puerco Lloron to grab a bite to eat. If you\'re not too tired, head up to Belltown for a little late afternoon shopping. Have dinner and drinks in either Belltown or Downtown—both have terrific restaurants that will give you your first taste of that famous Pacific Northwest cuisine. Head back to your hotel and collapse, knowing you won\'t have to rise with the sun the next day.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Day 2:</b> Take the two-minute monorail ride from Downtown\'s Westlake Center mall to the Seattle Center. Head up the Space Needle for 360-degree city views. Afterward take in one of Seattle Center\'s many ground-level attractions: the Pacific Science Center, the Children\'s Museum, the Experience Music Project, or the Science Fiction Experience museum. There aren\'t many good lunch options in Queen Anne, though if you\'re willing to head up Queen Anne Avenue North to Galer Street, the Five Spot Café is open all day. Otherwise, just grab what you can find and then walk southwest down Broad Street to the Olympic Sculpture Park. Head down to the International District to stroll around its streets, visit Uwajimaya superstore, and have dinner in one of its many restaurants.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Themes That Define the City</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Coffee:</b> It may be a cliché, but coffee is a huge part of Seattle\'s cultural identity. Although Starbucks has enough local fans to support quite a few branches within the city, it\'s not about the \'bucks at all. To truly understand the coffee culture—and to get a truly great cup of coffee—you have to visit the independent shops and local mini-chains, several of which manage to roast their own beans on-site without burning them (take that, Starbucks). A Seattleites relationship with coffee ranges from grabbing the daily quick fix in the morning to spending half the day at a local shop where every barista knows their name, reading, chatting with friends, or tapping away on a laptop. Many coffee shops pull double duty as art galleries, and some of them even pull double duty as <i>good</i> art galleries. Occasionally, shops hold special \"cupping\" events featuring hard to get coffees, which are much like wine-tastings. And don\'t worry about all that lingo: if someone actually gives you grief for not knowing a drip from an Americano, just go to another coffee shop—there\'s probably two or three others on the same block.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Pacific Northwest Cuisine:</b> With such an active population, and easy access to the best the sea and the land have to offer, it\'s no wonder that eating well is so important to Seattleites. Though you can find foods from nearly every continent, the city really shines when it comes to the cuisine that helped to put it on the culinary map. Pacific Northwest dishes emphasize fresh, locally produced ingredients; even some of the fanciest restaurants in town get their ingredients from the city\'s farmer\'s markets, Pike Place Market, and even in some cases from their chef\'s own organic farms. These fresh, seasonal ingredients can be combined in straightforward ways—inventive takes on American comfort food is a recent trend—or fused with European and Asian influences. Many of Seattle\'s celebrity chefs have gained their fame through their ambitious takes on Pacific Northwest cuisine, but you don\'t have to spend big bucks to get a taste: many bistros, bakeries, and cafes use local and organic ingredients as a matter of principle. Seattleites are pretty hard on their restaurants—this is still a city that favors substance over style—so when they say a restaurant\'s great, you can believe the hype.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Music:</b> First things first, grunge is over. Incredibly over. It\'s mystifying that this term is still used to describe all manner of the city\'s carefully disheveled indie rockers. Grunge peaked in the early nineties and was on the decline by 1996 (some would argue even earlier than that), and today you\'re more likely to catch alt-country bands, post-emo songwriters, or The Shins sound-a-likes than anything resembling grunge. Now that that\'s out of the way, know that Seattle\'s live music scene is still kicking, and it still seems like every other person in the city is in a band (or at the very least, is roommates with someone in a band). But the city\'s love of music is demonstrated more outside of its clubs than in them. You can see it in the independent record shops where staff members hand write meandering, sometimes poetic recommendations, in the continued success of (and pride in) local label Sub Pop Records, in the nearly mainstream support for excellent alternative radio station KEXP, the emergence and reemergence of mid-size venues that can draw the best national acts, and in the fact that many of the city\'s baristas treat their shifts like DJ sessions. Though Seattle\'s hip-hop and jazz scenes have yet to make any serious national waves, they\'re on the rise, and as the city continues to grow, it\'s musical lexicon will only widen.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The paved trails are wonderful for cycling, in-line skating, and pushing a stroller. Many kids have learned to ride their two-wheelers here; quite a few more have spent time on the large playground. Leashed dogs are welcome on the trails; a large off-leash area includes one of the few public beaches where pooches can swim. Farther south, on the mile-long shore, there\'s a swimming beach, a seasonal wading pool, and a boat launch. The park also has tennis courts, sports fields, and a terrific kite-flying hill. Be sure to look for the unique public art. <i>The Fin Project: From Swords to Plowshares</i> uses submarine fins to depict a pod of orca whales. <i>No Appointment Necessary</i> has two bright red chairs extended into the sky. <i>The Sound Garden</i> (at the neighboring National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration campus) has steel pipes that give off sounds when the wind blows for an art display that you can hear as well as see. From Downtown, take I-5 north to the Northeast 65th Street exit, turn right and continue east to Sand Point Way Northeast. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Frye Art Museum</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Frye was a forgotten museum for a while, haunted only by Seattleites who would come to visit their favorite paintings from the permanent collection—mostly 19th- and 20th-century representational pieces depicting pastoral scenes. But a new curator shook the Frye out of its stupor and now in addition to its beloved permanent collection, this elegant building plays host to eclectic and often avant-garde rotating exhibits. Recent shows have included morbid pencil drawings from Robyn O\'Neil; a large collection of pieces from illustrator Henry Darger\'s mad-genius, 15,000-page, unpublished manuscript; and a retrospective of works from the Leipzeig Art Academy. No matter what\'s going on in the stark, brightly lighted back galleries, it always seems to blend well with the permanent collection, which occupies two hushed and elegant galleries with velvet couches and dark-blue and purple walls—the latter usually serving as either an amuse-bouche or after-dinner mint to the featured exhibits. The museum is small enough that you can move through it in an hour, but you could easily spend more time here, too. The café has a small courtyard and real entrées in addition to sandwiches and sweets. www.fryeart.org. COST: Free. OPEN: Tues.-Sat. 10-5 (Thurs. until 8), Sun. noon-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Greg Kucera Gallery</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the most important destinations on the First Thursday gallery walk, this gorgeous space is a top venue for national and regional artists. Be sure to check out the outdoor sculpture deck on the second level. If you can only stomach one gallery visit, this is the place to go. You\'ll see big names that you might recognize along with newer artists and the thematic group shows are consistently well thought out and well presented. www.gregkucera.com. COST: Free. OPEN: Tues.-Sat. 10:30-5:30. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Discovery Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Discovery Park is Seattle\'s largest park, and it has an amazing variety of terrain: cool forest trails that can feel as secluded as mountain hikes lead to meadows, saltwater beaches, sand dunes, a lighthouse, and views that include Puget Sound, the Cascades, and the Olympics. There are 2.8 mi of trails through this urban wilderness, but the North Beach Trail, which takes you along the shore to the lighthouse, is a must-see. Head to the South Bluff Trail to get a view of Mt. Rainier and the skyline. The park has several entrances—if you want to stop at the visitor center to pick up a trail map before exploring, use the main entrance at Government Way. The North Parking Lot is much closer to the North Beach Trail and to Ballard and Fremont, if you\'re coming from that direction. To get to here from Downtown take 15th Avenue NW and get off at the Emerson Street exit onto W. Emerson. Make a right onto 23rd Avenue W, then a left onto Commodore Way, which will lead you to the park\'s north entrance. Note that the park is easily reached from Ballard and Fremont. It\'s sometimes easier to combine a park day with an exploration of those neighborhoods than with a busy Downtown itinerary. www.cityofseattle.net/parks. COST: Free. OPEN: Park daily 6 AM-11 PM, visitor center Tues.-Sun. 8:30-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wing Luke Asian Museum</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Named for the Northwest\'s first Asian-American elected official, this small, well-organized museum surveys the history and cultures of people from Asia and the Pacific islands who settled in the Pacific Northwest. Alongside the costumes, fabrics, crafts, and photographs that kids will love, the museum also provides sophisticated looks at how immigrants and their descendants have transformed and been transformed by American culture. The most poignant and sobering part of the museum is an excellent multimedia exhibit dealing with the internment of Japanese-American citizens in camps during World War II. The museum is a great place to start your tour of the I.D., as it will provide a context to the neighborhood and the communities living here that you won\'t get by simply wandering around. www.wingluke.org. COST: $4, free 1st Thurs. of month. OPEN: Tues.-Fri. 11-4:30, weekends noon-4. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Alki Beach</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In summer, cars inch along Alki Avenue, seeking a coveted parking space, all the passengers heading for this 2½-mi stretch of sand that has views of both the Seattle skyline and the Olympic Mountains. It\'s something of a California beach scene (except for the water temperature), with in-line skaters, joggers, and cyclists sharing the walkway and sun-loving singles playing volleyball and flirting. Year-round, families come to build sand castles, beachcomb, and fly kites; in winter, storm-watchers come to see the crashing waves. Facilities include drinking water, grills, picnic tables, phones, and restrooms; restaurants line the street across from the beach. To get here from Downtown, take either I-5 south or Highway 99 south to the West Seattle Bridge and exit onto Harbor Avenue Southwest, turning right at the stoplight. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Seville and Granada are like feuding sisters, one vivaciously flirting, the other darkly brooding; Córdoba and Cádiz are estranged cousins, one landlocked, the other virtually under sail; Huelva and Almería are universes apart, the first a verdant Atlantic Arcadia and the second a parched Mediterranean sunbelt; and Jaén is an upland country bumpkin—albeit with its Renaissance palaces—compared with the steamy cosmopolitan seaport of Málaga.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Getting Here</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Seville is easily reached by air, although from the U.S. you need to connect in Madrid or London. Domestically, airlines such as Air Europa, Spanair, and Vueling connect Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and other major Spanish cities with Seville, Granada, Málaga, and Gibraltar, while Iberia flies from Jerez de la Frontera to Almería, Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia, Ibiza, and Zaragoza.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From Madrid, the best approach to Andalusia is via the high-speed railroad connection, the AVE. In under three hours, the spectacular ride winds from Madrid\'s Atocha Station through the olive groves and rolling fields of the Castilian countryside to Córdoba and on to Seville. Another option, especially if you plan to go outside Seville, Granada, and Córdoba, is to travel by car. The main road south from Madrid is the A4/E5.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Planning Your Time</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A week in Andalusia should include visits to Córdoba, Seville, and Granada to see, respectively, the Mezquita, the Cathedral and its Giralda, and the Alhambra. Two days in each city nearly fills the week, though the extra day would be best spent in Seville, by far Andalusia\'s most vibrant concentration of art, architecture, culture, and excitement.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A week or more in Seville alone would be well spent, especially during the <i>Semana Santa</i> celebration when the city, though crowded, becomes a giant street party. With more time on your hands, Cádiz, Jerez de la Frontera, and Sanlúcar de Barrameda form a three- or four-day jaunt through flamenco, sherry, Andalusian equestrian culture, and tapas emporiums.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A three-day trip through the Sierra de Aracena will introduce you to a lovely Atlantic upland, filled with Mediterranean black pigs deliciously fattened on acorns, while the Alpujarra Mountains east of Granada offer anywhere from three days to a week of hiking and trekking opportunities in some of Iberia\'s highest and wildest reaches. For nature enthusiasts, there\'s also the highland Cazorla National Park and the wetland Doñana National Park—Andalusia\'s highest and lowest outdoor treasures.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It\'s in the former convent of La Merced Calzada, most of which dates from the 17th century. The collection includes works by Murillo and the 17th-century Seville school, as well as by Zurbarán, Velázquez, Alonso Cano, Valdés Leal, and El Greco; outstanding examples of Seville Gothic art; and baroque religious sculptures in wood (a quintessentially Andalusian art form). In the rooms dedicated to Sevillian art of the 19th and 20th centuries, look for Gonzalo Bilbao\'s <i>Las Cigarreras,</i> a group portrait of Seville\'s famous cigar makers. www.museosdeandalucia.es.

The crowds of people and the constant change can make travelers weary, so take advantage of the wide range of eateries and convenient benches.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Best of Shanghai</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On Day 1, start at <b>Yu Garden,</b> and take a walk through the old city streets and markets surrounding it. Next, head to <b>the Bund</b> for a waterfront stroll and a look at some of Shanghai\'s grandest historic buildings. Segue down <b>Nanjing Lu,</b> Shanghai\'s busiest street, for a spot of shopping.

For those on a smaller budget, the Dongtai Lu Antiques Market is near Xintiandi.

Although massively restored, Xintiandi is composed of Shanghai\'s traditional shikumen homes. Around the Former French Concession area, streets like Shaoxing Lu are still relatively untouched by development. Finally, take a long walk through Hongkou District, across the Garden bridge and down Sichuan Bei Lu where apartment blocks, bridges, and a huge post office still stand—testimony to the past glory of the city.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Top Attractions</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Yu Garden</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Garden offers an atmosphere of peace and beauty amid the clamor of the city, with rocks, trees, and walls curved to resemble dragons, bridges, and pavilions.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Bund</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shanghai\'s famous waterfront boulevard is lined with art-deco buildings and souvenir stands. It\'s great for people-watching, being watched yourself, shopping for increasingly chic clothes, and sampling some of Shanghai\'s most famous restaurants. It\'s also where you\'ll get that postcard view of the futuristic skyline in Pudong.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shanghai Museum</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">China\'s best museum houses an incomparable collection of art and artifacts, including paintings, sculpture, ceramics, calligraphy, furniture, and fantastic bronzes.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping on Nanjing Dong Lu</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">People come from all over China to shop on what was once China\'s premier shopping street—and it sometimes feels as though they\'re all here at the same time. Although it\'s still a little tawdry, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, pedestrian-only Nanjing Dong Lu is undergoing a massive face-lift, and trendy designer boutiques are beginning to emerge alongside pre-1960s department stores and old-fashioned silk shops.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Oriental Pearl Tower or Jinmao Tower</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Choose between the 1960s <i>Jetsons</i> kitsch of the Pearl Tower or the pagoda-inspired Jin Mao. If you head to the top of either of these two Pudong skyscrapers you\'ll be in for a bird\'s-eye view of the city and its surroundings. Try to count the cranes working incessantly on restructuring the city\'s skyline. Cloud Nine is a bar at the top of the Grand Hyatt in the Jin Mao, so you can sip a cocktail while looking out at the zillions of twinkling lights.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Former French Concession</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whether you\'re an architecture fanatic, a photographer, a romantic, or just plain curious, a wander through these streets is always a wonderful way to pass an afternoon. Fuxing Lu is a good long walk and the streets around Sinan Lu and Fuxing Park have some real architectural treats. Take your time and allow for breaks at cafés or in small boutiques.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dongtai Lu Antiques Market</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This is an ideal spot for souvenir shopping, practicing your Chinese bargaining, and observing Shanghai life at its most charming. On any given day, you might be caught up in part of a wedding, see fat-cheeked babies, or watch old men bent over a game of chess.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Xintiandi</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping, bars, restaurants, and museums mix together in restored traditional <i>shikumen</i>(stone gate) houses. Xintiandi is a popular location for hanging out and people-watching, and there are a few great boutiques. The small museums have interesting exhibits related to Shanghai\'s and the Communist Party\'s history.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Holidays and Festivals</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals in China are hard to pin down as the traditional ones are organized by the Chinese lunar calendar. This means they are often on different dates every year. For major holidays such as May Day and National Day, the government announces the official holiday period close to the event, which can be frustrating for those wishing to make travel plans. If you want to avoid traveling during major holiday times, remember to book well ahead and expect to pay a higher rate.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Chinese New Year</b>: This is the biggest holiday of the year and usually occurs in January or February. Families get together to eat dumplings and children are given new clothes and red envelopes with money inside. Fireworks displays are put on by the city and you\'ll find traditional dance performances at the large temples. Things can get a little quiet commercially, however, as some businesses close during the week-long holiday.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Lantern Festival</b>: This often falls soon after Chinese New Year. Lanterns in all shapes and sizes including rabbits and lotus flowers are lit. Special treats to eat include sweet dumplings called yuanxiao and tangyuan.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Qing Ming Festival</b>: The tomb-sweeping festival takes place on the 4th or 5th of April each year. On this day, Chinese people are supposed to visit their ancestors\' graves and do a bit of maintenance. There are no special organized events.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>May Day</b>: This is the Chinese form of Labor Day and takes place in the first week of May. Expect fireworks and massive crowds everywhere. Some businesses may also close as the owners take their own holiday.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Children\'s Day</b>: It seems like every day is Children\'s Day for some of China\'s little emperors. However, they also get their own special day on June 1 with parties and special deals at various child-friendly establishments.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Dragon Boat Festival</b>: Around 2000 years ago, a poet named Qu Yuan threw himself into the river in protest against the Emperor. To commemorate him, people now race dragon boats and eat <i>zongzi</i> (sticky rice dumplings). The date of this festival varies every year but is often in May or June.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Seven Sisters Festival</b>: The Chinese equivalent of Valentine\'s Day usually occurs in July or August. It is celebrated with romantic gifts and dinners but is not as commercialized as February 14th.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Mid-Autumn Festival</b>: Based on a legend of a woman in the moon called Chang\'e, families reunite to eat mooncakes and gaze upon the full moon during this festival. It usually takes place in September or October.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>National Day</b>: On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong stood on Tiananmen Square and proclaimed that the people of China had stood up. This was the birth of the People\'s Republic of China. It\'s commemorated each year with a week-long holiday. In Beijing, there are military parades in Tiananmen Square, but in Shanghai the action is limited to large crowds, a plethora of Chinese flags, and fireworks.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Eleven galleries exhibit Chinese artistry in all its forms: paintings, bronzes, sculpture, ceramics, calligraphy, jade, Ming and Qing Dynasty furniture, coins, seals, and art by indigenous populations. Its bronze collection is one of the best in the world, and its dress and costume gallery showcases intricate handiwork from several of China\'s 52 minority groups. If you opt not to rent the excellent acoustic guide, information is well presented in English. You can relax in the museum\'s pleasant tearoom or buy postcards, crafts, and reproductions of the artwork in the stellar bookshop. www.shanghaimuseum.net. COST: Y20, Y60 with acoustic guide. OPEN: Daily 9-4. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">People\'s Square</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once the southern half of the city\'s racetrack, Shanghai\'s main square has become a social and cultural center. The Shanghai Museum, Municipal Offices, Grand Theater, and Shanghai Urban Planning Center surround it. During the day, visitors and residents stroll, fly kites, and take their children to feed the pigeons. In the evening, kids roller-skate, ballroom dancers hold group lessons, and families relax together. Weekends here are especially busy. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Yu Garden</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Since the 18th century, this complex, with its traditional red walls and upturned tile roofs, has been a marketplace and social center where local residents gather, shop, and practice <i>qi gong</i> in the evenings. Although a bit overrun by tourists and not as impressive as the ancient palace gardens of Beijing, Yu Garden is a piece of Shanghai\'s past, and one of the few old sights left in the city.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To get to the garden itself, you must wind your way through the bazaar. The garden was commissioned by the Ming Dynasty official Pan Yunduan in 1559 and built by the renowned architect, Zhang Nanyang, over 19 years. When it was finally finished it won international praise as \"the best garden in southeastern China.\" In the mid-1800s the Society of Small Swords used the garden as a gathering place for meetings. It was here that they planned their uprising with the Taiping rebels against the French colonists. The French destroyed the garden during the first Opium War, but the area was later rebuilt and renovated.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Winding walkways and corridors bring you over stone bridges and carp-filled ponds and through bamboo stands and rock gardens. Within the park are an <b>old opera stage,</b> a <b>museum</b> dedicated to the Society of Small Swords rebellion, and an <b>exhibition hall,</b> opened in 2003, of Chinese calligraphy and paintings. One caveat: the park is almost always thronged with Chinese tour groups, especially on weekends. As with most sights in Shanghai, don\'t expect a tranquil time alone. COST: Y30.

An unknown master executed the breathtaking frescoes here some time between 1270 and 1280; despite some damage they retain their original colors and pack an emotional punch. The <i>Deposition/Lamentation</i> gives strong evidence that the Sienese school could paint emotion just as well as the Florentine school—and did it some 20 years before Giotto. Guided tours in English take place more or less every half hour and are limited to no more than 35 persons. COST: EUR 6; EUR 10 combined ticket includes the Duomo, Battistero, and Museo dell\'Opera Metropolitana. OPEN: June-Aug., daily 9:30-8; Sept.-May, daily 9:30-7. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Duomo</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Siena\'s Duomo is beyond question one of the finest Gothic cathedrals in Italy. The multicolored marbles and painted decoration are typical of the Italian approach to Gothic architecture—lighter and much less austere than the French. The amazingly detailed facade has few rivals in the region, although it\'s quite similar to the Duomo in Orvieto. It was completed in two brief phases at the end of the 13th and 14th centuries. The statues and decorative work were designed by Niccolo and Giovanni Pisano, although most of what we see today are copies, the originals having been removed to the nearby Museo dell\'Opera Metropolitana. The gold mosaics are 18th-century restorations. The Campanile (no entry) is among central Italy\'s finest, with the number of windows increasing with each level.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Duomo\'s interior, with its black-and-white striping throughout and finely coffered and gilded dome, is simply striking. Step in and look back up at Duccio\'s (circa 1255-1319) panels of stained glass that fill the circular window. Finished in 1288, it\'s the oldest example of stained glass in Italy. The Duomo is most famous for its unique and magnificent inlaid-marble floors, which took almost 200 years to complete; more than 40 artists contributed to the work, made up of 56 separate compositions depicting biblical scenes, allegories, religious symbols, and civic emblems. The floors are covered for most of the year for conservation purposes, but are unveiled during September and October. The Duomo\'s carousel pulpit, also much appreciated, was carved by Nicola Pisano (circa 1220-84) around 1265; the <i>Life of Christ</i> is depicted on the rostrum frieze. In striking contrast to all the Gothic decoration in the nave are the magnificent Renaissance frescoes in the <b>Biblioteca Piccolomini,</b> off the left aisle. Painted by Pinturicchio (circa 1454-1513) and completed in 1509, they depict events from the life of native son Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini (1405-64), who became Pope Pius II in 1458. The frescoes are in excellent condition and have a freshness rarely seen in work so old.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Duomo is grand, but the medieval Sienese people had even bigger plans. They wanted to enlarge the building by using the existing church as a transept for a new church, with a new nave running toward the southeast, to make what would be the largest church in the world. But only the sidewall and part of the new facade were completed when the Black Death struck in 1348, decimating Siena\'s population. The city fell into decline, funds dried up, and the plans were never carried out. (The dream of building the biggest church was actually doomed to failure from the start—subsequent attempts to get the project going revealed that the foundation was insufficient to bear the weight of the proposed structure.) The beginnings of the new nave, extending from the right side of the Duomo, were left unfinished, perhaps as a testament to unfulfilled dreams, and ultimately enclosed to house the adjacent <b>Museo dell\'Opera Metropolitana.</b> The <b>Cripta</b> was discovered during routine preservation work on the church and has been opened to the public. COST: EUR 3 Nov.-Aug.; EUR 6 Sept. and Oct.; EUR 10 combined ticket includes the Cripta, Battistero, and Museo dell\'Opera Metropolitana. OPEN: Mar.-Oct., Mon.-Sat. 10:30-7:30, Sun. 1:30-6:30; Nov.-Feb., Mon.-Sat. 10:30-6:30, Sun. 1:30-5:30. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Abbazia di Sant\'Antimo</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\'s well worth your while to visit this 12th-century Romanesque abbey, as it\'s a gem of pale stone in the silvery green of an olive grove. The exterior and interior sculpture is outstanding, particularly the nave capitals, a combination of French, Lombard, and even Spanish influences. The sacristy (seldom open) forms part of the primitive Carolingian church (founded in AD 781), its entrance flanked by 9th-century pilasters. The small vaulted crypt dates from the same period. Above the nave runs a <i>matroneum</i> (women\'s gallery), an unusual feature once used to separate the congregation. Equally unusual is the ambulatory, for which the three radiating chapels were almost certainly copied from a French model. Stay to hear the canonical hours celebrated in Gregorian chant. On the drive that leads up toward Castelnuovo dell\'Abate is a small shop that sells souvenirs and has washrooms. A 2½-hour hiking trail (signed as #2) leads to the abbey from Montalcino. Starting near Montalcino\'s small cemetery, the trailheads south through woods, along a ridge road to the tiny hamlet of Villa a Tolli, and then downhill to Sant\'Antimo. www.antimo.it. OPEN: Daily 6AM-9PM. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Basilica di San Francesco</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The remarkable frescoes by Piero della Francesca (circa 1420-92) in the Basilica di San Francesco were painted between 1452 and 1466. They depict scenes from the <i>Legend of the True Cross</i> on three walls of the <i>Capella Bacci,</i> a chapel behind the high altar. What Sir Kenneth Clark called \"the most perfect morning light in all Renaissance painting\" may be seen in the lowest section of the right wall, where the troops of the emperor Maxentius flee before the sign of the cross. A 15-year project restored the works to their original brilliance. A distant but free view of the frescoes is to be had from the main body of the church. For a closer look, make reservations at the ticket office in Piazza San Francesco, two doors down from the church. www.pierodellafrancesca.it. COST: Church free, Capella Bacci EUR 6. OPEN: Church: daily 8:30-6:30. Capella Bacci: Apr.-Oct., weekdays 9-6:30, Sat. 9-5:30, Sun. 1-5:30; Nov.-Mar., weekdays 9-5:30, Sat. 9-5, Sun. 1-5. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

By the time Raffles came to Singapore in 1819, to be a Malay was also to be a Muslim. Traditionally, Malays\' lives have centered on their religion and their villages, known as <i>kampongs.</i> These consisted of several wooden houses with steep roofs of corrugated iron or thatch gathered around a communal center, where chickens fed and children played under the watchful eye of mothers and the village elders while the younger men tended the fields or took to the sea in fishing boats. The houses were usually built on stilts above marshes and reached by narrow planks serving as bridges. If the kampong was on dry land, flowers and fruit trees would surround the houses.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">All traditional kampongs have fallen to the might of the bulldozer in the name of urban renewal. Though all ethnic groups have had their social fabric undermined by the demolition of their old communities, the Malays have suffered the most, since social life centered on the kampong.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The area known as the Arab District, while not a true kampong, remains a Malay enclave, held firmly together by strict observance of the tenets of Islam. At the heart of the community is the Sultan Mosque, or Masjid Sultan, originally built with a grant from the East India Company to the Sultan of Johor. Around it are streets whose very names—Bussorah, Baghdad, Kandahar—evoke the fragrances of the Muslim world. The pace of life is slower here: there are few cars, people gossip in doorways, and closet-size shops are crammed with such wares as <i>songkok,</i> the velvety diamond-shape hats worn by Muslim men; the lacy white skullcaps presented to <i>hajji,</i> those who have made the <i>hajj,</i> as the pilgrimage to Mecca is called; the tasseled, beaded, and embroidered <i>tudung</i> (head scarves) worn by devout Muslim women; Indonesian batiks; leather bags; and herbs whose packages promise youth, fertility, and beauty.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Arab District is a small area, bounded by Beach and North Bridge roads to the south and north and spreading a couple of blocks to either side of Arab Street. The area can further be divided up into the subneighborhoods of Kampong Glam (the region around Jalan Sultan) and Bugis (the area around infamous Bugis Street). It\'s a place to meander, taking time to browse through shops or enjoy Muslim food at a simple café.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Good Walk</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This walk begins at the foot of <b>Arab Street,</b> just off North Bridge Road. Wander past the specialty shops and take a right onto Baghdad Street; watch for a dramatic view of the <b>Sultan Mosque</b> where <b>Bussorah Street</b> opens to your left. Leaving the mosque, return to Arab Street and take the first left onto Muscat Street, turn right onto Kandahar Street, and then left onto Baghdad Street. At Sultan Gate you\'ll find <b>Istana Kampong Glam</b>, the sultan\'s Malay-style palace, built in the 1840s. Baghdad Street becomes Pahang Street at Sultan Gate, where Chinese stonemasons create statues curbside. At the junction of Pahang Street and Jalan Sultan, turn right and, at Beach Road, left to visit the endearing <b>Hajjah Fatimah Mosque</b>, built in 1845. It leans at a six-degree angle. Return to Jalan Sultan and take a right; keep walking, crossing over <b>North Bridge Road,</b> to the junction of Victoria Street and the <b>Malabar Muslim Jama-Ath Mosque</b>.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Follow Victoria Street down to <b>Bugis Street</b>. Three blocks beyond where Bugis Street becomes Albert Street—between the Fu Lu Shou shopping complex and the food-oriented Albert Complex—is Waterloo Street. Near the corner is the <b>Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple</b>, or just Kwan Im for short, one of Singapore\'s most popular Chinese temples.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Timing</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This walking tour shouldn\'t take more than two hours, including stops to look around the temples and mosques. But take your time. This is one of the friendliest areas in Singapore. It\'s best to go around 10 in the morning so you can catch a glimpse of the locals at the mosques. If you\'ve got time, stop in at one of Arab Street\'s few hookah cafés.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Orchard Road</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If \"downtown\" is defined as where the action is, then Singapore\'s downtown is Orchard Road. Here are some of the city\'s most fashionable shops, hotels (which often, like the Hilton, have expensive, upscale malls all their own), restaurants, and nightclubs. The street has been dubbed the 5th Avenue or Bond Street of Singapore, but, air of luxury aside, it has little in common with either of those older, relatively understated marketplaces for the wealthy. Orchard Road is an ultra-high-rent district that\'s very modern and very, very flashy—especially at night, when millions of light bulbs, flashing from just about every building, assault your eyes. Additionally, this is Singapore\'s best place for people-watching; a perfect distraction from or alternative to a shopping adventure. Relative to the other neighborhoods, there are few sites of historical interest along Orchard Road.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Good Walk</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Start at the bottom of Orchard Road and head toward the junction with Scotts Road, the hub of downtown. You\'ll see the enormous <b>Istana</b>, once the official residence of the colonial governor and now that of the president of the republic. On the other side of Orchard Road and a few steps down Clemenceau Avenue is the lovely old <b>Tan Yeok Nee House</b>. Built in 1885 for a wealthy Chinese merchant, the house has served various purposes, including headquarters for the Salvation Army. It\'s now the Asian campus for the University of Chicago\'s graduate business school. Turn on Tank Road and continue to the <b>Chettiar Temple</b>, which houses the image of Lord Subramaniam. Return to Orchard Road and turn left. On the right is Cuppage Road, with a market (open every morning) known for imported and unusual fruit and a row of antiques shops.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Returning once more to Orchard Road, you\'ll pass the block-long Centrepoint; immediately after it is <b>Peranakan Place</b>. A detour up Scotts Road leads to the landmark <b>Goodwood Park Hotel</b> which offers one of the most civilized high teas in town. Farther up Scotts Road is the <b>Newton Circus</b> food hawker center.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Retrace your steps to the intersection of Scotts and Orchard roads. Walk up the left side of Orchard Road, past the Wheelock Place Building, which houses the large Borders, as much a social center as a bookstore. Taxi drivers call this section of Wheelock Place \"the rocket,\" and you\'ll see why. As you continue up Orchard Road, the Palais Renaissance will be on your right. Just before Orchard turns into Tanglin, you\'ll find the Tanglin Shopping Centre on your left; the second floor has some of the best antiques shops in town. Tanglin Mall, at the junction of Tanglin and Napier roads, has chic boutiques and an excellent food court.

There\'s clear evidence, however, of earlier Malay settlements, and also of an early Chinese presence, such as the 14th-century city of Temasek, which had an elegant and prosperous aristocracy. At various times Singapore fell under the sway of the Javanese and Thai empires. When Raffles arrived, the two sons of its previous sultan, who had died six years earlier, were in dispute over the throne. Raffles backed the claim of the elder brother, Tunku Hussein Mohamed Shah, and proclaimed him sultan. Offering to support the new sultanate with British military strength, Raffles persuaded him to grant the British a lease allowing them to establish a trading post on the island in return for an annual rent; within a week the negotiations were concluded. (A later treaty ceded the island outright to the British.) Within three years the fishing village, surrounded by swamps and jungle and populated only by tigers, 200 or so Malays, and a scattering of Chinese, had become a boomtown of 10,000 immigrants, administered by 74 British employees of the East India Company.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As Singapore grew, the British erected splendid public buildings, churches, and hotels, often using Indian convicts for labor. The Muslim, Hindu, Taoist, and Buddhist communities—swelling rapidly from the influx of fortune-seeking settlers from Malaya (now Malaysia), India, and South China—built mosques, temples, and shrines. Magnificent houses for wealthy merchants sprang up, and the harbor was soon lined with <i>godowns</i> (warehouses) to hold all the goods passing through the port.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">By the turn of the century, Singapore had become the entrepôt of the East, a mix of adventurers and \"respectable middle classes.\" World War I hardly touched the island, although its defenses were strengthened to support the needs of the British navy, for which Singapore was an important base. When World War II broke out, the British were complacent, expecting that any attack would come from the sea and that they would be well prepared to meet it. But the Japanese landed to the north, in Malaya. The two British battleships that had been posted to Singapore were sunk, and Japanese land forces raced down the peninsula on bicycles.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In February 1942 the Japanese captured Singapore. A huge number of Allied civilians and military were sent to Changi Prison; others were marched off to prison camps in Malaysia or to work on the notorious \"Death Railway,\" in Thailand. The three and a half years of occupation was a time of privation and fear; an estimated 100,000 people died. The Japanese surrendered August 21, 1945, and the Allied forces returned to Singapore. The security of the British Empire was, however, never again to be felt, and independence for British Southeast Asia was only a matter of time.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1957 the British agreed to the establishment of an elected 51-member legislative assembly in Singapore. General elections in 1959 gave an overwhelming majority—43 of 51 seats—to the People\'s Action Party (PAP), and a young Chinese lawyer named Lee Kuan Yew became Singapore\'s first prime minister. In 1963 Singapore became part of the Federation of Malaysia, along with the newly independent state of Malaysia.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mainly due to Malays\' anxiety over a possible takeover by the ethnic Chinese, the federation broke up two years later, and Singapore became an independent sovereign state. The electorate supported Lee Kuan Yew and the PAP time and again. In 1990 Lee resigned after 31 years as prime minister, though as a senior minister he maintains his strong grip. His firm leadership of the party, his social and economic legislation, <i>and</i> his suppression of criticism led to his reputation as a (usually) benevolent dictator; yet Singaporeans recognize that his firm control had much to do with the republic\'s economic success and high standard of living. Lee\'s son, Lee Hsien Loong, officially took over from Lee\'s handpicked successor, Goh Chok Tong, as prime minister on August 12, 2004. His style of governing seems to reveal a determination to distance himself from his father\'s style of leadership.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Good Walk: Colonial Singapore</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Start from <b>Collyer Quay</b> and Clifford Pier, where most European colonists and Asian immigrants first set foot on the island. Leaving Clifford Pier, walk up the quay—toward the Singapore River—until you come to the imposing former <b>General Post Office</b>, now the Fullerton Hotel. On the hotel\'s left side is the gracious, old iron-link <b>Cavenagh Bridge</b>. If you walk along the river\'s south bank before crossing the bridge, you\'ll find what was once a wide towpath and is now a paved pedestrian street of restaurants and bars—<b>Boat Quay</b>. The second building on your left houses Harry\'s Bar, which gained international attention in 1995 as a haunt of derivatives trader Nick Leeson, the guy who brought down the venerable Barings Bank.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once over the Cavenagh Bridge, take a left onto North Boat Quay. Slightly back from the river is the huge, white <b>Empress Place Building</b>, home of the flagship Asian Civilisations Museum.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A bit farther along the quay is the <b>statue of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles</b>, who is believed to have landed on this spot in 1819. Turn right onto St. Andrew\'s Road until you come to <b>Old Parliament House</b>, on your left, the oldest government building in Singapore, and on your right, <b>Victoria Memorial Hall</b>, built in 1905 as a tribute to Queen Victoria. Across the road is the old <b>Singapore Cricket Club</b>. Just past it, on your right as you continue up St. Andrew\'s Road, is the <b>Padang</b>, or playing field. To your left are the <b>Supreme Court</b> and <b>City Hall</b>, two splendidly pretentious, stately buildings. Continuing northeast on St. Andrew\'s Road, which runs along the Padang, cross Coleman Street toward the lawns that surround the Anglican <b>St. Andrew\'s Cathedral</b>.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Northeast of the cathedral is the huge <b>Raffles City</b> complex, easily recognized by the towers of two hotels—Swissôtel The Stamford and Raffles The Plaza. Cross Stamford Road and walk through Raffles City to Bras Basah Road. Across the street is the renowned <b>Raffles Hotel</b>. After touring the hotel, continue up Bras Basah Road to Queen Street and make a right to the <b>Singapore Art Museum</b>. Across Bras Basah Road and down Victoria Street, you\'ll no doubt find a place to rest and people-watch at the <b>Chijmes</b> complex. Continue southwest on Victoria Street (it becomes Hill Street after Stamford Road); the <b>Armenian Church</b> will be on your right just before Coleman Street. From here stamp collectors should turn left onto Coleman and visit the <b>Singapore Philatelic Museum</b>; alternatively, turn right on Coleman, then right again onto Armenian Street, and you\'ll be at the <b>Asian Civilisations Museum, Armenian Street</b>. To see the <b>Singapore History Museum</b> instead, return to Stamford Road and make a left. You may wish to conclude your tour with a stroll through <b>Ft. Canning Park</b>, pausing at the European Cemetery and the Tomb of Iskander Shah, or visit Singapore\'s biggest underground military operations quarters (used during World War II) at the Battle Box. South of the park is <b>Clarke Quay</b>, where you can eat and shop.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Timing</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With time factored in to wander through the Raffles Hotel and view the exhibits at one or more of the area\'s four museums, this walk should take a full day. Allow an hour for the Raffles, including time out for a Singapore Sling in the Long Bar. It should take at least an hour to view the museum exhibits. Avoid the Boat Quay area from noon-2 PM, when the lunchtime crowd takes over. Remember to buy water wherever you can; it\'s easy to get dehydrated in Singapore\'s heat.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The current structure, built in 1928 by Denis Santry of Swan &amp; Maclaren—the architect who designed the Victoria Memorial Hall—is a dramatic building with golden domes and minarets that glisten in the sun. The walls of the vast prayer hall are adorned with green and gold mosaic tiles on which passages from the Qur\'an are written in decorative Arab script. The main dome has an odd architectural feature: hundreds of brown bottles, stacked five or more rows deep, are jammed in neck first between the dome and base. No one knows why. Five times a day—at dawn, 12:30, 4, sunset, and 8:15—the sound of the muezzin, or crier, calls the faithful to prayer. At midday on Friday, the Islamic Sabbath, seemingly every Malay in Singapore enters through one of the Sultan Mosque\'s 14 portals to recite the Qur\'an. During Ramadan, the month of fasting, the nearby streets, especially Bussorah, and the square in front of mosque are lined with hundreds of stalls selling curries, cakes, and candy; at dusk Muslims break their day\'s fast in this square. Non-Muslims, too, come to enjoy the rich array of Muslim foods and the party atmosphere. The best view of the Sultan Mosque is at the junction of Bussorah Street and Beach Road. OPEN: Daily 9-4. Metro: Bugis. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Dedicated to Vishnu the Preserver, the temple is easy to recognize by its 60-foot-high monumental gopuram, with tiers of intricate sculptures depicting Vishnu in the nine forms in which he has appeared on earth. Especially vivid are the depictions of Vishnu\'s manifestations as Rama, on his seventh visit, and as Krishna, on his eighth. Rama is thought to be the personification of the ideal man; Krishna was brought up with peasants and, therefore, was a manifestation popular with laborers in Singapore\'s early days. Sri Srinivasa Perumal is very much a people\'s temple. Inside you\'ll find devotees making offerings of fruit to one of the manifestations of Vishnu. This is done either by handing coconuts or bananas, along with a slip of paper with your name on it, to a temple official, who\'ll chant the appropriate prayers to the deity and place holy ash on your head; or by walking clockwise while praying, coconut in hand, around one of the shrines a certain number of times, then breaking the coconut (a successful break symbolizes that Vishnu has been receptive to the incantation). Dress conservatively, and don\'t wear shoes inside. OPEN: Daily 6:30 AM-noon and 6 PM-9 PM. Metro: Farrer Park. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Thian Hock Keng Temple</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This structure—the Temple of Heavenly Happiness—was completed in 1842 to replace a simple shrine built 20 years earlier. It\'s one of Singapore\'s oldest and largest Chinese temples, built on the spot where, prior to land reclamation, immigrants stepped ashore after a hazardous journey across the China Sea. In gratitude for their safe passage, the Hokkien people dedicated the temple to Ma Chu P\'oh, the goddess of the sea. It\'s richly decorated with gilded carvings, sculptures, tile roofs topped with dragons, and fine carved-stone pillars. The pillars and sculptures were brought over from China, the exterior cast-iron railings were made in Glasgow, and the blue porcelain tiles on an outer building came from Holland. On either side of the entrance are two stone lions. The one on the left is female and holds a cup symbolizing fertility; the other, a male, holds a ball, a symbol of wealth. If the temple is open, note that as you enter, you must step over a high threshold board. This serves a dual function. First, it forces devotees to look downward, as they should when entering the temple. Second, it keeps out wandering ghosts—ghosts tend to shuffle their feet, so if they try to enter, the threshold board will trip them.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Inside, a statue of a maternal Ma Chu P\'oh surrounded by masses of burning incense and candles dominates the room. On either side of her are the deities of health (on the left if your back is to the entrance) and wealth. The two tall figures you\'ll notice are her sentinels: one can see for 1,000 miles; the other can hear for 1,000 miles. The gluey black substance on their lips—placed there by devotees in days past—is opium, meant to heighten their senses. Although the main temple is Taoist, the temple at the back is Buddhist and dedicated to Kuan Yin, the goddess of mercy. Her many arms represent how she reaches out to all those who suffer on earth. This is a good place to learn your fortune. Choose a number out of the box, then pick up two small stenciled pieces of wood at the back of the altar and let them fall to the ground. If they land showing opposite faces, then the number you have picked is valid. If they land same-side up, try again. From a valid number, the person in the nearby booth will tell you your fate, and whether you like it or not, you pay for the information. Leave the grounds by the alley that runs alongside the main temple. The two statues to the left are the gambling brothers. They will help you choose a lucky number for your next betting session; if you win, you must return and place lighted cigarettes in their hands. www.nhb.gov.sg. OPEN: Daily 7:30-5:30.

The natural environment, which is rich in marine life, flora, and fauna, has been likened to a \"natural supermarket.\" Antigua\'s superior anchorages and strategic location naturally caught the attention of the colonial powers. The Dutch, French, and English waged numerous bloody battles throughout the 17th century (eradicating the remaining Arawaks and Caribs in the process), with England finally prevailing in 1667. Antigua remained under English control until achieving full independence on November 1, 1981, along with Barbuda, 26 mi (42 km) to the north.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Boats and beaches go hand in hand with hotel development, of course, and Antigua\'s tourist infrastructure has mushroomed since the 1950s. Though many of its grand dames such as Curtain Bluff remain anchors, today all types of resorts line the sand, and the island offers something for everyone, from gamboling on the sand to gambling in casinos. Environmental activists have become increasingly vocal about preservation and the limiting of development, and not just because green travel rakes in the green. Antigua\'s allure is precisely that precarious balance and subliminal tension between its unspoiled natural beauty and its sun-sand-surf megadevelopment. And, of course, the British heritage persists, from teatime (and tee times) to fiercely contested cricket matches.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

In 1671 the governor of the Leeward Islands wrote to the Council for Foreign Plantations in London, pointing out the advantages of this landlocked harbor. By 1704 English Harbour was in regular use as a garrisoned station.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1784, 26-year-old Horatio Nelson sailed in on the HMS <i>Boreas</i> to serve as captain and second-in-command of the Leeward Island Station. Under him was the captain of the HMS <i>Pegasus,</i> Prince William Henry, duke of Clarence, who was later crowned King William IV. The prince acted as best man when Nelson married Fannie Nisbet on Nevis in 1787.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When the Royal Navy abandoned the station at English Harbour in 1889, it fell into a state of decay, though adventuresome yachties still lived there in near-primitive conditions. The Society of the Friends of English Harbour began restoring it in 1951; it reopened with great fanfare as Nelson\'s Dockyard, November 14, 1961. Within the compound are crafts shops, restaurants, and two splendidly restored 18th-century hotels, the Admiral\'s Inn and the Copper &amp; Lumber Store Hotel, worth peeking into. (The latter, occupying a supply store for Nelson\'s Caribbean fleet, is a particularly fine example of Georgian architecture and has an interior courtyard evoking Old England.) The Dockyard is a hub for oceangoing yachts and serves as headquarters for the annual Sailing Week Regatta in late April and early May. Water taxis will ferry you between points for EC$5. The Dockyard National Park also includes serene nature trails accessing beaches, rock pools, and crumbling plantation ruins and hilltop forts.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Dockyard Museum,</b> in the original Naval Officer\'s House, presents ship models, mock-ups of English Harbour, displays on the people who worked there and typical ships that docked, silver regatta trophies, maps, prints, antique navigational instruments, and Nelson\'s very own telescope and tea caddy. www.antiguamuseums.org.

There are few signs of life now that Beach House and K Club have closed. The water can be rough with a strongish undertow in spots, though it\'s mainly protected by the reefs that make the island a diving mecca.

Too bad summer is also one of the briefest seasons. The weather can get hot and humid, although more often than not summers are sunny and pleasant. Fall brings beautiful foliage—take a scenic drive to capture the changing colors of the season. If you must come in winter, the miles-long enclosed skyway system in both downtowns will allow you to park, go to lunch, shop, and see a show, all while never setting a foot out in the blistery cold. For those brave enough for the challenge, several winter events, including downtown\'s Holidazzle Parade and St. Paul\'s Winter Carnival, almost make the cold weather bearable.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Summer brims with endless local festivals but the most celebrated are the Minnesota State Fair (www.mnstatefair.org) and the Uptown Art Fair (www.uptownminneapolis.com/art-fair). Both events take place in August. The Uptown Art Fair in Minneapolis draws more than 400 exhibitors with art ranging from jewelry to pottery to abstract sculptures. Prices tend to lean toward the serious art set, but there are still some affordable bargains to be found. The Minnesota State Fair heralds the end of the summer for many Minnesotans. Running at the end of August through Labor Day, it\'s something that cannot be adequately explained, just an experience to behold. Some highlights include foods of all kind on-a-stick and/or deep-fried, several animal barns, blue ribbon winners for baking, art exhibits, and national music acts.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">What Are the Top Experiences?</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Cultural events overload:</b> Museums? Check. Two of the best include the world-class modern art museum the Walker Art Center and the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Theatre? Check. The Hennepin Avenue Theatre District offers Broadway shows in addition to the esteemed productions the Guthrie Theater puts on. Music? Check. The Cities draw national acts and gave plenty of musicians their start (Prince, The Replacements, Soul Asylum, and Bob Dylan, to name a few). Sports? Check. For now, the Minnesota Vikings and University of Minnesota Gophers football teams and the Minnesota Twins baseball team all share the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome (900 S. 5th St., Minneapolis 612/332-0386 www.msfc.com). The Minnesota Wild hockey team plays in St. Paul\'s Xcel Energy Center (317 Washington St., St. Paul 651/989-5151 www.xcelenergycenter.com) and the Minnesota Timberwolves basketball team plays at the Target Center (600 1st Ave. N, Minneapolis 612/673-1600 www.targetcenter.com).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Shop till you drop:</b> The Mall of America is ground zero for shoppers visiting the Twin Cities. Appropriately nicknamed the Megamall, it has more than 500 stores, an aquarium, and amusement park. To experience more local flavor, venture beyond the mall to some of the Cities\' best neighborhood boutiques. Unique shops dot Hennepin Avenue in Minneapolis\' Uptown area, southwest of the city\'s downtown. Grand Avenue in St. Paul is home to several one-of-a-kind shops, particularly the strip between Dale Street and Lexington Avenue. Still looking for more? Consider the neighborhoods of Highland Park and St. Anthony Park in St. Paul and the Warehouse District and North Loop in Minneapolis.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Exploring outdoors:</b> Perhaps given the cold winter temperatures, Minnesotans cherish the all-too-brief outdoor summer weather even more than their Midwest counterparts. Take a summers day stroll through Como Park Zoo and Conservatory. Picnic near Minnehaha Falls in Minnehaha Park or nosh some tasty fish tacos at the Park\'s inexpensive restaurant Sea Salt Eatery (4825 Minnehaha Ave., 612/721-8990, www.seasalteatery.com). End the day walking around Lake Calhoun with Minneapolis locals. The summer also brings various street fairs and local farmers\' markets. August offers two of the best outdoor festivals, the Uptown Art Fair and the Minnesota State Fair.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Architectural wonders:</b> The Twin Cities offers several architectural must-sees, both modern and historical. Whereas St. Paul is Romanesque sandstone mansions and the iconic Cathedral of St. Paul, Minneapolis is through and through modern with a smattering of the historic preserved. The architectural biggies of Minneapolis have received national coverage, bringing a sense of pride to the locals. To cover your bases, check out the IDS Center, Walker Art Center, Guthrie Theater, Minneapolis Central Library and Weisman Art Museum.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Local food:</b> The Twin Cities\' restaurant scene has changed dramatically in recent years, thanks in part to several nationally recognized chefs who are challenging the local palate with culinary wonders. Two celebrity chefs with culinary outfits in Minneapolis include Wolfgang Puck\'s 20.21 in the Walker Art Center and Jean Georges Vongerichten\'s Chambers Kitchen in the Chambers boutique hotel. The growing immigrant population has introduced ethnic food to the Twin Cities\' cuisine; head to 17-block Eat Street (Nicollet Ave. from Grant to 29 St.) for the best slice of authenticity.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>History 101:</b> Interested in learning more about the mighty Mississippi River and the two towns linked by it?

The Hennepin Avenue Theatre District brings Broadway to Minneapolis, or for something different, try one of the many experimental theaters.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Architecture:</b> Between the world-class architects who have added their modern designs and the old art deco preserved in the historic landmarks, architecture lovers will have a full itinerary.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Mall of America:</b> The largest enclosed mall in the nation.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Minneapolis Sound:</b> Prince, the Replacements, Soul Asylum, Atmosphere—these local musicians define the genre that has been reproduced by artists across the country. Local darlings Bob Dylan and Mason Jennings round out that sweet Twin Cities noise.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Chain of Lakes:</b> Minnesota isn\'t called the Land of 10,000 Lakes for nothing. Rent a canoe at Lake Calhoun and disappear for the day. Enjoy an outdoor concert at Lake Harriet, or head out to Lake Minnetonka for the ultimate boating experience.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Where Should I Focus My Energy?</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>If you\'re here for 1 day:</b> Even with a brief visit, you can still fall in love with the Twin Cities by focusing on downtown Minneapolis. Check out the Walker Art Center and adjacent sculpture garden, then shop and dine your way down Nicollet Mall. See a show at the acclaimed Guthrie Theater or in the Hennepin Avenue Theatre District.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>If you\'re here for 2 days:</b> Spend a day exploring Lake Calhoun and Uptown. They\'re within walking distance of each other, and Uptown\'s funky-fun restaurants and shops are nicely contrasted with Lake Calhoun\'s serenity.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>If you\'re here for 3 days:</b> Head to the Mall of America for all the shopping and eating you could want under one roof.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>If you\'re here for 4 days:</b> Add St. Paul to the itinerary. You\'ll have the best experiences in its neighborhoods. Tour the historic homes on Summit Avenue and explore the urban shopping and eating on Grand Avenue (between Dale Street and Lexington Avenue). Nearby Cathedral Hill on Selby Avenue is anchored by the Cathedral of St. Paul and offers stellar neighborhood dining and shopping options.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>If you\'re here for 5 days:</b> Check out another museum or two: Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Science Museum of Minnesota, Minnesota Children\'s Museum(651/225-6000 www.mcm.org), Minnesota History Center, or the Weisman Art Museum. Learn some history at Historic Fort Snelling(612/726-1171 www.mnhs.org) or take a fun St. Paul Gangster Tour (651/292-1220).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>If you\'re here for 6 days:</b> For some outdoor enjoyment, add Como Park Zoo and Conservatory or Minnehaha Park to your itinerary.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>If you\'re here for 7 days or more:</b> Head out to under-the-radar neighborhoods Northeast Minneapolis and the University of Minnesota\'s Dinkytown for unique shops and restaurants. Wander over to \"the U\'s\" gorgeous campus and Stadium Village area to get your \"Ski-U-Mah\" on. Stop at the Frank Gehry-designed Weisman Art Museum while you\'re there.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Claim to Fame</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Local celebrities include Garrison Keillor of Prairie Home Companion fame; Prince, who got his start at First Avenue in downtown Minneapolis; Charles Schulz, creator of the Peanuts cartoon strip; and even Bob Dylan, who technically hails from Hibbing, Minnesota. The opening credits of the 1970s sitcom The Mary Tyler Moore Show features Mary tossing her hat on Nicollet Mall, a pedestrian-only thoroughfare in downtown Minneapolis. A statue commemorating this event sits right outside Macy\'s. Sports teams are also a sense of pride for the Twin Cities. Although the Minnesota Twins baseball team last won a World Series in 1991, fans still hold the Twins in high esteem and couldn\'t be more proud of today\'s team. St. Paul was recently christened Hockeytown USA in 2007 by Sports Illustrated for its devotion to the Minnesota Wild hockey team. With Wisconsin nearby, the rivalry between Minnesota Vikings and Green Bay Packers fans is legendary, even penetrating outside of football circles.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

A stay of 10 days would allow trips outside the city and give you time to explore a few of Sydney\'s lesser-known delights.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Start with an afternoon Sydney Harbour Explorer cruise for some of the best views of the city. Follow with a tour of the Rocks, the nation\'s birthplace, and take a sunset walk up onto the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The following day, take a Sydney Explorer tour to the famous Sydney Opera House and relax in the afternoon in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Domain South, and Domain North parks. On the third day, explore the city center, with another spectacular panorama from the Sydney Tower. Include a walk around Macquarie Street, a living reminder of Sydney\'s colonial history, and the contrasting experience of futuristic Darling Harbour, with its museums, aquarium, cafés, and lively shops.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 6 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Follow the three-day itinerary above, then visit Kings Cross, Darlinghurst, and Paddington on the fourth day. You could continue to Bondi, Australia\'s most famous beach. The next day, catch the ferry to Manly to visit its beach and the historic Quarantine Station. From here, take an afternoon bus tour to the northern beaches, or return to the city to shop or visit museums and galleries. Options for the last day include a trip to wildlife or national park, Taronga Zoo, or the Sydney Olympic Park west of the city.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 10 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Follow the six-day itinerary above, and then travel beyond the city by rental car or with an organized tour. Take day trips to the Blue Mountains, Hunter Valley, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, the Hawkesbury River, or the historic city of Parramatta to Sydney\'s west. Or travel on the Bondi Explorer bus to Vaucluse or the charming harborside village of Watsons Bay. You could take a boat tour to the historic harbor island of Fort Denison, play a round of golf, or just shop or relax on the beach.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Sydney Beaches</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sydney is paradise for beach-lovers. Within the metropolitan area there are more than 30 ocean beaches, all with golden sand and rolling surf, as well as several more around the harbor with calmer water for safe swimming. If your hotel is on the harbor\'s south side, the logical choice for a day at the beach is the southern ocean beaches between Bondi and Coogee. On the north side of the harbor, Manly is easily accessible by ferry, but beaches farther north involve a longer trip by car or public transportation.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lifeguards are on duty at most of Sydney\'s ocean beaches during summer months, and flags indicate whether a beach is being patrolled. \"Swim between the flags\" is an adage that is drummed into every Australian child, with very good reason: the undertow can be very dangerous. If you get into difficulty, don\'t fight the current. Breathe evenly, stay calm, and raise one arm above your head to signal the lifeguards.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although there\'s no shortage of sharks inside and outside the harbor, the risk of attack is very low. These species are not typically aggressive toward humans, and shark nets protect many Sydney beaches. A more-common hazard is jellyfish, known locally as bluebottles, which inflict a painful sting—with a remote risk of more-serious complications (including severe allergic reactions). The staff at most beaches will supply a spray-on remedy to help relieve the pain, which generally lasts about 24 hours. Many beaches will post warning signs when bluebottles are present, but you can also determine the situation yourself by looking for the telltale bright-blue, bubblelike jellies washed up along the waterline.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Topless sunbathing is common at all Sydney beaches, but full nudity is permitted only at a couple of locations, including Lady Jane Beach, close to Watsons Bay on the south side of the harbor.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Details of how to reach the beaches by bus, train, or ferry are provided below, but some of the city\'s harbor and southern beaches are also on the Bondi Explorer bus route. These are Nielsen Park, Camp Cove, Lady Jane, Bondi, Bronte, Clovelly, and Coogee.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Inside the Harbor</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Balmoral</b>. This 800-yard-long, rarely crowded beach—among the best of the inner-harbor beaches—is in one of Sydney\'s most exclusive northern suburbs. There\'s no surf, but it\'s a great place to learn to windsurf (sailboard rentals are available). The Esplanade, which runs along the back of the beach, has a handful of upscale restaurants, as well as several snack bars and cafés that serve award-winning fish-and-chips. In summer you can catch performances of Shakespeare on the Beach. You could easily combine a trip to Balmoral with a visit to Taronga Zoo. To reach Balmoral, take the ferry from Circular Quay to Taronga Zoo and then board Bus 238. Raglan St., Balmoral.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Camp Cove</b>. Just inside South Head, this crescent-shape beach is where Sydney\'s fashionable people come to see and be seen. The gentle slope and calm water make it a safe playground for children. A shop at the northern end of the beach sells salad rolls and fresh fruit juices. The grassy hill at the southern end of the beach has a plaque to commemorate the spot where Captain Arthur Phillip, the commander of the First Fleet, first set foot inside Port Jackson. Parking is limited; arrive by car after 10 on weekends, and keep in mind it\'s a long walk to the beach. Take Bus 324 or 325 from Circular Quay. Cliff St., Watsons Bay.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Lady Jane</b>. Lady Jane—officially called Lady Bay—is the most accessible of the nude beaches around Sydney. It\'s also a popular part of Sydney\'s gay scene. Only a couple of hundred yards long and backed by a stone wall, the beach has safe swimming with no surf. From Camp Cove, follow the path north and then descend the short, steep ladder leading down the cliff face to the beach.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Nielsen Park</b>. By Sydney standards, this beach at the end of the Vaucluse Peninsula is small, but behind the sand is a large, shady park that\'s ideal for picnics. The headlands at either end of the beach are especially popular for their magnificent views across the harbor. The beach is protected by a semicircular net, so don\'t be deterred by the beach\'s correct name, Shark Bay. The shop and café behind the beach sell drinks, snacks, and meals. Parking is often difficult on weekends. Historic Greycliffe House—built in 1840 and now used as National Park offices—is in the park, while the more-elaborate and stately Vaucluse House is a 10-minute walk away. Take Bus 325 from Circular Quay. Greycliffe Ave. off Vaucluse Rd., Vaucluse.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">South of the Harbor</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Bondi</b>. Wide, wonderful Bondi (pronounced <i>bon</i>-dye) is the most famous and most crowded of all Sydney beaches. It has something for just about everyone, and the droves that flock here on a sunny day give it a bustling, carnival atmosphere unmatched by any other Sydney beach. Facilities include toilets, showers, and a kiosk on the beach that rents out sun lounges, beach umbrellas, and even swimsuits. Cafés, ice-cream outlets, and restaurants line Campbell Parade, which runs behind the beach. Families tend to prefer the calmer waters of the northern end of the beach. Surfing is popular at the south end, where a path winds along the sea-sculpted cliffs to Tamarama and Bronte beaches. Take Bus 380, 382, or the new 333 all the way from Circular Quay, or take the train from the city to Bondi Junction and then board Bus 380, 382, or 333. Campbell Parade, Bondi Beach.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Bronte</b>. If you want an ocean beach that\'s close to the city, has both sand and grassy areas, and offers a terrific setting, this one is hard to beat. A wooded park of palm trees and Norfolk Island pines surrounds Bronte. The park includes a playground and sheltered picnic tables, and excellent cafés are in the immediate area. The breakers can be fierce, but swimming is safe in the sea pool at the southern end of the beach. Take Bus 378 from Central Station, or take the train from the city to Bondi Junction and then board Bus 378. Bronte Rd., Bronte.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Coogee</b>. A reef protects this lively beach (pronounced <i>kuh</i>-jee), creating calmer swimming conditions than those found at its neighbors. A grassy headland overlooking the beach has an excellent children\'s playground. Cafés in the shopping precinct at the back of the beach sell ice cream, pizza, and the ingredients for picnics. Take Bus 373 from Circular Quay or Bus 372 from Central Station. Coogee Bay Rd., Coogee.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Tamarama</b>. This small, fashionable beach—aka \"Glam-a-rama\"—is one of Sydney\'s prettiest, but the rocky headlands that squeeze close to the sand on either side make it less than ideal for swimming. The sea is often hazardous here, and surfing is prohibited. A café in the small park behind the beach sells sandwiches, fresh juices, and fruit whips. Take the train from the city to Bondi Junction and then board Bus 391, or walk for 10 minutes along the cliffs from the south end of Bondi Beach. Tamarama Marine Dr., Tamarama.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">North of the Harbor</h2><p /><div><b>Dee Why-Long Reef</b>. Separated from Dee Why by a narrow channel, Long Reef Beach is remoter and much quieter than its southern neighbor. However, Dee Why has better surfing conditions, a big sea pool, and several good restaurants. To get here take Bus 136 from Manly. The Strand, Dee Why.</div><div><b>Manly</b>. The Bondi Beach of the north shore, Manly caters to everyone except those who want to get away from it all. On sunny days Sydneysiders, school groups, and travelers from around the world crowd the 2-km-long (1¼-mi-long) sweep of white sand and take to the waves to swim and ride boards. The beach is well equipped with changing and toilet facilities and lockers. The promenade that runs between the Norfolk Island pines is great for people-watching and rollerblading. Cafés, souvenir shops, and ice-cream parlors line the nearby shopping area, the Corso. Manly also has several nonbeach attractions including Oceanworld, an aquarium about 200 yards from the ferry wharf. The ferry ride from the city makes a day at Manly feel more like a holiday than just an excursion to the beach. Take a ferry or JetCat from Circular Quay. From the dock at Manly the beach is a 10-minute walk. Steyne St., Manly.</div><div><b>Palm Beach</b>. The golden sands of Palm Beach run along one side of a peninsula separating the large inlet of Pittwater from the Pacific Ocean. Bathers can easily cross from the ocean side to Pittwater\'s calm waters and sailboats, and you can take a circular ferry trip around this waterway from the wharf on the Pittwater side. The view from the lighthouse at the northern end of the beach is well worth the walk. Nearby shops and cafés sell light snacks and meals. Take Bus 190 from Wynyard bus station. Ocean Rd., Palm Beach.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Building Sydney</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Descended from Scottish clan chieftains, Governor Lachlan Macquarie was an accomplished soldier and a man of vision. Macquarie, who was governor from 1810 to 1821, was the first governor to foresee a role for New South Wales as a free society rather than an open prison. He laid the foundations for that society by establishing a plan for the city, constructing significant public buildings, and advocating that reformed convicts be readmitted to society.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Macquarie\'s policies of equality may seem perfectly reasonable today, but in the early 19th century they marked him as a radical. When his vision of a free society threatened to blur distinctions between soldiers, settlers, and convicts, Macquarie was forced to resign. He was later buried on his Scottish estate, his gravestone inscribed with the words \"the Father of Australia.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Macquarie\'s grand plans for the construction of Sydney might have come to nothing were it not for Francis Greenway. Trained as an architect in England, where he was convicted of forgery and sentenced to 14 years in New South Wales, Greenway received a ticket of prison leave from Macquarie in 1814 and set to work transforming Sydney. Over the next few years he designed lighthouses, hospitals, convict barracks, and many other government buildings, several of which remain to bear witness to his simple but elegant eye. Greenway was eventually even depicted on one side of the old A$10 notes, which went out of circulation early in the 1990s. Only in Australia, perhaps, would a convicted forger occupy pride of place on the currency.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

In 1954 the state premier appointed a committee to advise the government on the building of an opera house. The site chosen was Bennelong Point (named after an early Aboriginal inhabitant), which was, until that time, occupied by a tram depot. The premier\'s committee launched a competition to find a suitable plan, and a total of 233 submissions came in from architects the world over. One of them was a young Dane named Joern Utzon.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">His plan was brilliant, but it had all the markings of a monumental disaster. The structure was so narrow that stages would have minuscule wings, and the soaring \"sails\" that formed the walls and roof could not be built by existing technology.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nonetheless, Utzon\'s dazzling, dramatic concept caught the judges\' imagination, and construction of the giant podium began in 1959. From the start, the contractors faced a cost blowout; the building that was projected to cost A$7 million and take four years to erect would eventually require A$102 million and 15 years. Construction was financed by an intriguing scheme. Realizing that citizens might be hostile to the use of public funds for the controversial project, the state government raised the money through the Opera House Lottery. For almost a decade, Australians lined up to buy tickets, and the Opera House was built without depriving the state\'s hospitals or schools of a single cent.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Initially it was thought that the concrete exterior of the building would have to be cast in place, which would have meant building an enormous birdcage of scaffolding at even greater expense. Then, as he was peeling an orange one day, Utzon had a flash of inspiration. Why not construct the shells from segments of a single sphere? The concrete ribs forming the skeleton of the building could be prefabricated in just a few molds, hoisted into position, and joined together. These ribs are clearly visible inside the Opera House, especially in the foyers and staircases of the Concert Hall.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1966 Utzon resigned as Opera House architect and left Australia, embittered by his dealings with unions and the government. He has never returned to see his masterpiece. A team of young Australian architects carried on, completing the exterior one year later. Until that time, however, nobody had given much thought to the <i>interior.</i> The shells created awkward interior spaces, and conventional performance areas were simply not feasible. It\'s a tribute to the architectural team\'s ingenuity that the exterior of the building is matched by the aesthetically pleasing and acoustically sound theaters inside.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Guided one-hour tours depart at frequent intervals from the tour office, on the lower forecourt level, daily between 9 and 5.

The roadway is supported by the arch, not by the massive stone pylons, which were added for aesthetic rather than structural reasons. The 1,650-foot-long bridge is 160 feet wide and contains two sets of railway tracks, eight road lanes, a bikeway, and a footpath on both sides. Actor Paul Hogan worked for several years as a rigger on the bridge, long before he earned international fame as the star of <i>Crocodile Dundee.</i> Sydneysiders love of Harbour Bridge was displayed in earnest on March 18, 2007, when 200,000 people walked across to commemorate its 75th anniversary.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are several ways to experience the bridge and its spectacular views. The first is to follow the walkway from its access point near the Argyle Stairs to the <b>South East Pylon</b> (tel. 02/9240-1100). This structure houses a display on the bridge\'s construction, and you can climb the 200 steps to the lookout and its unbeatable harbor panorama. The fee is A$8.50 and the display is open daily 10-5. Another (more expensive) option—not for those afraid of heights—is the <b>BridgeClimb tour</b> (tel. 02/8274-7777), which takes you on a guided walking tour to the very top of Harbour Bridge, 439 feet above sea level. The cost ranges from A$165 to A$200 per person, depending on which tour you select. The third option is to walk to the midpoint of the bridge to take in the views free of charge, but be sure to take the eastern footpath, which overlooks the Sydney Opera House. Access is via the stairs on Cumberland Street, close to the Shangri-La Hotel. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Manly</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Bondi Beach of the north shore, Manly caters to everyone except those who want to get away from it all.

It has a widespread reputation for beach volleyball. There are lifeguards here as well as a marina, concessions, showers, and rest rooms. Around Pier 60 there\'s a big, modern playground. This is the site of a nightly sunset celebration complete with musicians and artisans. It\'s one of the area\'s nicest and busiest beaches, especially on weekends and during spring break, but it\'s also one of the costliest in terms of parking fees, which can reach $1.25 per hour. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Florida State University Ringling Center for the Cultural Arts</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Along Sarasota Bay, Ringling built a grand home that was patterned after the Palace of the Doges in Venice. This exquisite mansion of 32 rooms, 15 bathrooms, and a 61-foot Belvedere Tower was completed in 1925, and is a must-visit today. Its 8,000-square-foot terrace overlooks the dock where Ringling\'s wife, Mable, moored her gondola. The <b>John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art</b> is the state art museum of Florida and houses 500 years of art, including a world-renowned collection of Rubens paintings and tapestries. The <b>Ringling Circus Museum</b> displays circus memorabilia from its ancient roots to modern day. The Tibbals Learning Center, which opened in early 2006, focuses on the American circus and the collection of Howard Tibbals, master model builder, who spent 40 years building the world\'s largest miniature circus. This impressive to-scale replica of the circa 1920s and \'30s Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus is authentic from the number of pancakes the circus cooks are flipping, to the exact likenesses and costumes of the performers (painstakingly re-created from photography and written accounts), to the correct names of the animals marked on the miniature mess buckets. Tibbals\'s passion to re-create every exact detail continues in his on-site workshop, where kids can ask him questions and watch him carving animals and intricate wagons. www.ringling.org.

The big cats are just one of the reasons the theme park attracts some 4½ million visitors each year. This is a world-class zoo, with more than 2,000 animals and a live entertainment venue that provides a full day (or more) of entertainment for the whole family. For the best animal sightings, go to their habitats early, when it\'s cooler also. If you want to beat the crowds, start in the back of the park and work your way around clockwise.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The 335-acre adventure park\'s habitats offer views of some of the world\'s most endangered and exotic animals. You can experience up-close animal encounters on the <b>Serengeti Plain,</b> a 65-acre free-roaming habitat that is home to reticulated giraffes, Grevy\'s zebras, white rhinos, bongos, impalas, and more. <b>Myombe Reserve</b> allows you to view lowland gorillas and chimpanzees in a lush, tropical rain-forest environment.

On the wings of an African hawk, riders fly through a three-minute journey 200 feet up, then (gulp!) plunge 90 degrees straight down at 70 mi per hour. The park\'s coaster lineup also includes steel giants <b>Kumba, Scorpion,</b> and <b>Montu,</b> a double wooden roller-coaster called <b>Gwazi,</b> and <b>Cheetah Chase</b>—a five-story family coaster full of hairpin turns and breathtaking dips. The off-road safari <b>Rhino Rally</b> brings you face-to-face with elephants, white rhinos, and Nile crocodiles (when it\'s running properly, which isn\'t always the case). <b>Land of the Dragons</b> is a 4-acre kids\' playground that has rides, special shows, play areas, and a three-story tree house with towers and stairways.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For those 21 years or older, the <b>Hospitality House</b> in the Bird Gardens offers complimentary Anheuser-Busch products, and the <b>Budweiser Beer School</b> hosts a 30-minute lesson in the art, science, and tradition of beer brewing.

During the height of tourist season, mid-December to late April, park workers dress in period costumes at Camp Uzita, demonstrate the use of 16th-century weapons, and show how European explorers prepared and preserved food for their overland journeys. The season ends with a reenactment of the explorer\'s landing. The site also offers a film and short nature trail through the mangroves. www.nps.gov/deso. COST: Free.

The mind-expanding paintings in this downtown headliner include <i>Eggs on a Plate Without a Plate</i>, <i>The Hallucinogenic Toreador,</i> and more than 90 other oils. You\'ll also discover more than 2,000 additional works including watercolors, drawings, sculptures, photographs, and objets d\'art. Free hour-long tours are led by well-informed docents. How did the collection end up here? A rich industrialist and friend of Dalí\'s, Ohio magnate A. Reynolds Morse, was looking for a museum site after his huge collection began to overflow his mansion. The people of St. Petersburg vied admirably for the collection, and the museum was established here as a result. www.salvadordalimuseum.org. COST: $15.

There are six professional repertory theaters—including the Habmiah and the Cameri in Tel Aviv—and dozens of regional and amateur companies performing throughout the country. They perform almost exclusively in Hebrew.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Professional dance companies are also abounding in Israel today.

As well as \"Israeli\" folk dancing (really a blend of Jewish and non-Jewish folk dance forms from around the world), some of Israel\'s different ethnic groups have preserved their traditional dances.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Enthusiasm for the visual arts can be seen in all walks of Israeli life.

(If you\'re feeling adventurous or can\'t sleep, take full advantage of your jetlag by starting your trip with nightlife in parts of the city that never sleep.) Direct train service starts around 5 AM from Shinjuku (Toei Oedo line) or Roppongi (Hibiya subway line) and gets you to Tsukiji or Tsukujishijo stations respectively in under 20 minutes.

From there, head to <b>Ueno</b> for an afternoon with its many museums, vistas, and historic sites.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 3</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Start Day 3 with a morning stroll through <b>Ginza</b> to explore its fabled shops and <i>depato</i> (department stores). Then hit a chic restaurant or café for lunch (more reasonably priced ones are easily found on the upper floor of most department stores). In the afternoon, see the Shinto shrine, <b>Meiji Jingu</b> and take a leisurely walk through the nearby Harajuku and Omotesando fashion districts to the <b>Nezu Institute of Fine Arts.</b></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 4</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend the morning browsing in <b>Akihabara,</b> Tokyo\'s electronics quarter, or visit the nearby Shinto <b>Kanda Myojin.</b> Spend the afternoon on the west side of <b>Shinjuku,</b> Tokyo\'s 21st-century model city; savor the view from the observation deck of architect Kenzo Tange\'s monumental <b>Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office</b>; and cap off the day with a walk through the greenery of <b>Shinjuku Gyo-en National Garden.</b></div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 5</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you can stay a fifth day, fill in the missing pieces: the Buddhist temple, <b>Sengaku-ji</b> in Shinagawa, the remarkable <b>Edo-Tokyo Hakubutsukan</b> in <b>Ryogoku,</b> a tea ceremony, kabuki play, or any of the shops you passed by. See a sumo tournament, if there\'s one in town. Or just visit the <b>Kokugikan,</b> National Sumo Arena, in the Ryogoku district, and some of the sumo stables in the neighborhood.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kanpai!</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whether you\'re out with friends, clients, or belting out a tune at the local karaoke bar, you\'re sure to have a drink at least once during your stay. Things may look a little different, even before you start knocking back a few, so take note on the liquors of this island nation. And remember, shout <i>Kanpai!</i> (sounds like \"kaan-pie\") instead of <i>Cheers!</i> when you raise your glass.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beverage of the Samurai</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sake, pronounced <i>sa-</i>kay, is Japan\'s number one alcoholic beverage. There are more than 2,000 different brands of sake produced throughout Japan. Like other kinds of wine, sake comes in sweet (<i>amakuchi</i>) and dry (<i>karakuchi</i>) varieties; these are graded <i>tokkyu</i> (superior class), <i>ikkyu</i> (first class), and <i>nikkyu</i> (second class) and are priced accordingly. (Connoisseurs say this ranking is for tax purposes and is not necessarily a true indication of quality)</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Best drunk at room temperature (<i>nurukan</i>) so as not to alter the flavor, sake is also served heated (<i>atsukan</i>) or with ice (<i>rokku de</i>). It\'s poured from <i>tokkuri</i> (small ceramic vessels) into tiny cups called <i>choko.</i> The diminutive size of these cups shouldn\'t mislead you into thinking you can\'t drink too much. The custom of making sure that your companion\'s cup never runs dry often leads the novice astray.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><i>Junmaishu</i> is the term for pure rice wine, a blend of rice, yeast, and water to which no extra alcohol has been added. Junmaishu sake has the strongest and most distinctive flavor, compared with various other methods of brewing, and is preferred by the sake <i>tsu,</i> as connoisseurs are known.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Apart from the <i>nomiya</i> (bars) and restaurants, the place to sample sake is the izakaya, a drinking establishment that usually serves dozens of different kinds of sake, including a selection of <i>jizake,</i> the kind produced in limited quantities by small regional breweries throughout the country.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Heavenly Spirits</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><i>Shochu</i> is made from grain and particularly associated with the southern island of Kyushu. It\'s served either on the rocks or mixed with water and can be hot or cold. Sometimes a wedge of lemon or a small pickled apricot, known as <i>umeboshi,</i> is added as well. It can also be mixed with club soda and served cold.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Havin\' a Biiru</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Japan has four large breweries: Asahi, Kirin, Sapporo, and Suntory. Asahi and Kirin are the two heavyweights, constantly battling for the coveted title of \"Japan\'s No. 1 Brewery,\" but many beer fans rate Suntory\'s Malts brand and Sapporo\'s Yebisu brand as the tastiest brews in the land. Although there are some microbreweries across Japan, locally produced brews can still be hard to find, even when you know they exist.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Traditional Japanese Drama</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kabuki</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Kabuki emerged as a popular form of entertainment by women dancing lewdly in the early 17th century; before long, the authorities banned it as a threat to public order. Eventually it cleaned up its act, and by the latter half of the 18th century it had become popular with common folks—especially the townspeople of bustling Edo, which would grow into Tokyo. Kabuki had music, dance, and spectacle; it had acrobatics and sword fights; it had pathos and tragedy, historical romance and social satire. It no longer had bawdy beauties, however—women have been banned from the Kabuki stage since 1629—but in recompense it developed a professional role for female impersonators, who train for years to project a seductive, dazzling femininity. It had—and still has—superstars and quick-change artists and legions of fans, who bring their lunch to the theater, stay all day, and shout out the names of their favorite actors at the stirring moments in their favorite plays.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Kabuki repertoire does not really grow or change, but stars like Ennosuke Ichikawa and Tamasaburo Bando have put exciting, personal stamps on their performances that continue to draw audiences young and old. If you don\'t know Japanese, you can still enjoy a performance: Tokyo\'s Kabuki-za (Kabuki Theater) has simultaneous English translation of its plays available on headphones.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">No</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">No is a dramatic tradition far older than Kabuki: it reached a point of formal perfection in the 14th century and survives virtually unchanged from that period. No developed for the most part under the patronage of the warrior class; it\'s dignified, ritualized, and symbolic. Many of the plays in the repertoire are drawn from classical literature or tales of the supernatural, and the texts are richly poetic. Some understanding of the plot of each play is necessary to enjoy a performance, which moves at a nearly glacial pace—the pace of ritual time—as it\'s solemnly chanted. The major No theaters often provide synopses of the plays in English.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The principal character in a No play wears a carved wooden mask. Such is the skill of the actor—and the mysterious effect of the play—that the mask itself may appear expressionless until the actor \"brings it to life,\" at which point the mask seems to convey a considerable range of emotions. As in Kabuki, the various roles of the No repertoire all have specific costumes—robes of silk brocade with intricate patterns that are works of art in themselves.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">No is not very <i>accessible</i>: its language is archaic, its conventions are obscure, and its pace can put even Japanese audiences to sleep. That said, the best way to see No is in the open air, at torchlight performances called Takigi No, held in the courtyards of temples. The setting and the aesthetics of the drama combine to produce an eerie theatrical experience. In Tokyo, as a contrast to the rest of the city, No will provide an experience of Japan as an ancient, sophisticated culture.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><i>Kyogen</i> are shorter, lighter plays that are often interspersed in between No performances and are much more accessible than No. If No doesn\'t appeal to you, consider taking advantage of opportunities to see kyogen instead.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bunraku</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The third major form of traditional Japanese drama is Bunraku puppet theater. Though its origins date to the 10th century, the golden age of Bunraku didn\'t occur until the 18th century, when most of the form\'s great plays were written and the puppets themselves evolved to their present form. These puppets are so large, they cover the puppeteers underneath them, and are so expressive and intricate in their movements, that they require three people at one time to manipulate them. Puppeteers and narrators, who deliver their lines in a kind of high-pitched croak from deep in the throat, train for many years to master this difficult and unusual genre of popular entertainment. Elaborately dressed in period costume, each puppet is made up of interchangeable parts: a head, shoulder piece, trunk, legs, and arms. Various puppet heads are used for roles of different sex, age, and character, and a certain hairstyle will indicate a puppet\'s position in life.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To operate one puppet, three puppeteers must act in unison. The <i>omozukai</i> controls the expression on the puppet\'s face and its right arm and hand. The <i>hidarizukai</i> controls the puppet\'s left arm and hand along with any props that it\'s carrying. The <i>ashizukai</i> moves the puppet\'s legs. This last task is the easiest. The most difficult task belongs to the omozukai. It takes about 30 years to become an expert. A puppeteer must spend 10 years as ashizukai, an additional 10 as hidarizukai, and then 10 more years as omozukai. These master puppeteers not only skillfully manipulate the puppets\' arms and legs but also roll the eyes and move the lips so that the puppets express fear, joy, and sadness.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">-Jared Lubarsky and David Miles</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Also here are 84 objects designated by the government as National Treasures. The Honkan rotates the works on display several times during the year. It also hosts two special exhibitions annually (April and May or June, and October and November), which feature important collections from both Japanese and foreign museums. These, unfortunately, can be an ordeal to take in: the lighting in the Honkan is not particularly good, the explanations in English are sketchy at best, and the hordes of visitors make it impossible to linger over a work you especially want to study. The more attractive <b>Toyokan,</b> to the right of the Honkan, completed in 1968, is devoted to the art and antiquities of China, Korea, Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, and Egypt. www.tnm.go.jp.

Five days is enough to see many of the highlights: the Art Gallery of Ontario, the CN Tower, the Rogers Centre, Harbourfront, the Distillery District, Casa Loma, and plenty of the neighborhoods from Kensington Market and Chinatown to Little Italy and Yorkville. These itineraries don\'t include side trips to Niagara Falls or the theater festivals at Niagara-on-the-Lake and Stratford, so you\'d need to adjust your plans to include them.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 1</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The four icons of modern Toronto are close enough together that they can all be visited on a single, albeit busy, day. Start at Queen and Bay streets at the eye-shape City Hall. (Its quaint predecessor, Old City Hall, is across the street.) Walk one block east to the Eaton Centre, at Yonge Street. The atrium-style roof is worth a peek even if you don\'t stay to browse the 300 or so shops. Next, walk back to Bay Street and head south through the Financial District, with its handsome skyscrapers; head west on Front Street to the spectacular CN Tower. It\'s not hard to find—just look up. Take the speedy elevator to the observation deck and then lunch at the 360 Revolving Restaurant.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Next, pay a visit to the tower\'s neighbor, the spectacular Rogers Centre. (Many locals still refer to it as the SkyDome, its first moniker.) You should buy tickets ahead of time for a Toronto Blue Jays baseball game. Or, if the stadium is not in use, you can take a guided tour (call ahead). Leaving the Rogers Centre, walk or take a taxi south to Queen\'s Quay Terminal, part of the city\'s Harbourfront Centre. There\'s plenty to do here, from shopping and browsing the galleries to taking an impromptu pottery-making class. As the sun sets, take a stroll along the waterfront and then head to one of the great restaurants nearby. The streetcar running along the center of Queen\'s Quay (make sure the sign in front says Union) will take you back a couple of blocks north to Union subway station.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 2</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Prepare for a mix of culture and shopping. Spend the morning exploring the original Chinatown—laid out west along Dundas Street behind City Hall—all the way over to the \"new\" Chinatown, in and around the busy Spadina Avenue-Dundas Street intersection. Cross Spadina and turn right for the colorful Kensington Market. Settle into a restaurant along Baldwin Street or walk south on Spadina to Queen Street West (five short blocks) and make a left to check out the funky shopping district with restaurants and cafés. Spend the afternoon at the Art Gallery of Ontario (at Dundas and McCaul streets), and also see the new space-age building that hovers over the Ontario College of Art and Design, next door to the AGO. In the evening, pick your favorite ethnic cuisine and head to one of the city\'s excellent restaurants.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 3</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Begin the day amid the Yorkville boutiques, at the northwest corner of Yonge and Bloor Streets. Shops in restored Victorian residences, and outdoor cafés (plenty with strong Italian espresso) may charm the credit cards out of your pocket. Before the country\'s most chic shops settled here, Yorkville was a hippie haven in the 1960s, attracting emerging musical artists Joni Mitchell and Gordon Lightfoot. The shops spill onto Bloor Street West, and the strip between Yonge Street and Avenue Road is sometimes referred to as Toronto\'s Fifth Avenue. Your next stop is the nearby Royal Ontario Museum, at Bloor West and Queen\'s Park, with pieces from the worlds of art, archaeology, and science; even though some galleries are closed due to ongoing refurbishment, plan to spend some time here. (Across the street is the Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art, and a short walk west on Bloor Street West is the Bata Shoe Museum at St. George Street.) In the evening, take in a play, a concert, or a comedy show at Second City.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 4</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\'re here in summer, take the subway south to Union Station and then walk to the docks at the foot of Bay Street and Queen\'s Quay to catch one of the ferries to the Toronto Islands; the view of the city skyline is an added plus. Make sure you know which of the many islands suits you best; in summer, particularly on weekends, kids have the run of Centre Island. In winter, take the kids to the Ontario Science Centre, with its engaging exhibits and demonstrations. The science center is 11 km (7 mi) northeast of downtown. Another far-flung spot worth a visit is the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, an outstanding museum with works by Canadian and First Nations artists, on 100 wooded acres. When you\'re back downtown in the evening, look for a place where you can dine alfresco—patio dining, as the locals say—or head to hip College Street in Little Italy.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 5</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Roam some special neighborhoods in Toronto. Purchase a TTC Day Pass, which allows unlimited use of transit vehicles after 9:30 AM weekdays (all day weekends) and is available at subway stations. Some areas to the east of downtown are Rosedale, an affluent neighborhood with antiques shops, and the Danforth, with Greek restaurants. At Church and Wellesley streets is the center of the gay community. Southeast of that is Cabbagetown, which has handsome 19th-century homes. King Street East is Toronto\'s new home furnishings and design district, and streetcars running east from here will take you to the Beaches, a great place to stroll the lakefront and shop. The Esplanade area at Front Street has an increasing number of trendy eateries, but St. Lawrence Market, with stalls of prepared and fresh foods, has been here forever. East of the Esplanade is the Historic Distillery area composed of art galleries, boutiques, restaurants, and home to many festivals year-round. West of downtown along Bloor Street is the artsy Annex community, and south along Spadina is the western border of the University of Toronto downtown campus. The surrounding residential area has cafés and good second-hand bookstores, particularly around Harbord Street. You\'ll find intriguing eateries everywhere.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Quintessential Toronto</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Art Gallery of Ontario.</b> Among a stellar array of art, the Henry Moore collection—the world\'s largest public holding of the sculptor\'s work—stands out.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>CN Tower.</b> The world\'s tallest freestanding structure, and its glass-floor observation deck, is not to be missed.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>High Park.</b> City residents come to play among the almost 400 acres of parkland west of the city.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>St. Lawrence Market.</b> Shop for upscale cheese and sausage varieties below where the city\'s first government met in this 1844 market hall.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Toronto Maple Leafs.</b> Hockey\'s toughest ticket to score is Toronto\'s team, but it\'s worth the effort for a true Canadian experience.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Brief History of Toronto</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The city officially became Toronto on March 6, 1834, but its roots are much more ancient than that. In the early 1600s, a Frenchman named Etienne Brûlé was sent into the not-yet-Canadian wilderness by the famous explorer Samuel de Champlain to see what he could discover. He discovered plenty: the river and portage routes from the St. Lawrence to Lake Huron, possibly Lakes Superior and Michigan, and eventually Lake Ontario. Of course, the native Huron peoples had known this area between the Humber and Don rivers for centuries—and had long called it \"Toronto,\" believed to mean \"meeting place.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Later, a bustling village called Teiaiagon grew up here, and then it was the site of a French trading post. After the British won the Seven Years\' War, the trading post was renamed \"York\" in 1793. More than 40 years later, the city again took the name Toronto. Following an unsuccessful American invasion in 1812, several devastating fires, and a rebellion in 1837, there was a slow but steady increase in the population of white Anglo-Saxon Protestants leading into the 20th century. Since WWII, though, Toronto has attracted residents from all over the world. And unlike the American \"melting pot\" phenomenon that melds everyone together, Toronto is more of a \"tossed salad\" of diverse ethnic groups.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

In early 2004,\"Transformation AGO\" was launched—a major expansion designed by world-renowned architect (and Toronto native son) Frank Gehry. A 20% increase in overall building size will allow for 97,000 square feet of additional gallery space; completion is scheduled for late 2008, at a cost of C$254 million. Torontonians will not recognize the new AGO, as Gehry plans a monumental glass and titanium facade to be built over the main building.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Temporary exhibits continue to rotate during construction, but the only permanent display open for most of 2008 will be the <b>Henry Moore Sculpture Centre,</b> the largest public collection of Moore\'s sculpture in the world. People of all ages can enjoy climbing in and around Henry Moore\'s large <i>Two Forms</i> sculpture, which is just outside the AGO, on McCaul Street.

The C$63 million building weighs 130,000 tons and contains enough concrete to build a curb along Highway 401 from Toronto to Kingston, some 262 km (162 mi) to the east. It\'s worth a visit if the weather is clear, despite the steep fee. Six glass-front elevators zoom up the outside of the tower. The elevators travel at 20 feet per second and the ride takes less than a minute—a rate of ascent similar to that of a jet-plane takeoff. Each elevator has one floor-to-ceiling glass wall—three opaque walls make the trip easier on anyone prone to vertigo.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are four observation decks to choose from. The <b>Glass Floor Level,</b> which is exactly what it sounds like, is about 1,122 feet above the ground. It\'s like walking on a cloud. This could well be the most photographed indoor location in the city—lie on the transparent floor and have your picture taken from above like countless before you. Don\'t worry—the glass floor can support 85,000 pounds. Above is the <b>Look Out Level,</b> at 1,136 feet; one floor more, at 1,150 feet, is the excellent <b>360 Revolving Restaurant.</b> (If you\'re here to dine at the restaurant, your elevator fee is waived.) At an elevation of 1,465 feet, the <b>Sky Pod</b> is the world\'s highest public observation gallery. All the levels provide spectacular panoramic views of Toronto, Lake Ontario, and the Toronto Islands. On really clear days you may see Lake Simcoe to the north and the mist rising from Niagara Falls to the south.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the ground level, the <b>Marketplace at the Tower</b> has 12,500 square feet of shopping space with quality Canadian sports and travel items and souvenirs, along with a shop selling Inuit art. There\'s also the <b>Fresh Market Cafe,</b> with seating for 300; the <b>Maple Leaf Cinema,</b> which screens the 20-minute documentary <i>The Height of Excellence,</i> about the building of the Tower; and the <b>Themed Arcade,</b> with the latest in virtual-game experiences and the new Himalamazon motion picture ride based loosely on the Himalayan and Amazon regions. Peak visiting hours are 11 to 4; you may wish to work around them, particularly on weekends. www.cntower.ca. COST: First 2 observation levels C$21.99, Sky Pod C$26.99, combined packages start at C$32.99. OPEN: Oct.-Apr., daily 9AM-10PM; June-Sept., daily 9AM-11PM. Metro: Union. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">St. Lawrence Market</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Built in 1844 as the first true Toronto city hall, the building now has an exhibition hall upstairs—the Market Gallery—where the council chambers once stood. It is also a food market, which began growing up around the city hall in the early 1900s. Considered by <i>Food &amp; Wine</i> magazine to be one of the world\'s 25 best food markets, it is renowned for its local and imported foods such as fresh shellfish, sausage varieties, and cheeses. Stop and snack on Canadian bacon, also known as \"peameal bacon,\" at the Market\'s Carousel Bakery. The plain brick building across Front Street, on the north side, is open on Saturday mornings for the 200-year-old farmers\' market; it\'s a cornucopia of fine produce and homemade jams, relishes, and sauces from farms just north of Toronto. On Sunday the wares of more than 80 antiques dealers are on display in the same building. www.stlawrencemarket.com.

During the 1500s Spanish explorers arrived to find Pima Indians growing crops in the area. Father Eusebio Francisco Kino, a Jesuit missionary whose influence is still strongly felt throughout the region, first visited the area in 1687, and returned a few years later to build missions.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The name Tucson came from the Native American word <i>stjukshon</i> (pronounced <i>stook</i>-shahn), meaning \"spring at the foot of a black mountain.\" The springs at the foot of Sentinel Peak, made of black volcanic rock, are now dry. The name was pronounced <i>tuk</i>-son by the Spanish explorers who built a wall around the city in 1776 to keep Native Americans from reclaiming it. At the time, this <i>presidio</i> (fortified city), called San Augustin del Tuguison, was the northernmost Spanish settlement in the area, and present-day Main Avenue is a quiet reminder of the former Camino Real (\"royal road\") that stretched from this tiny walled fort all the way to Mexico City.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Four flags have flown over Tucson—Spanish, Mexican, Confederate, and, finally, the Stars and Stripes. Tucson\'s allegiance changed in 1820 when Mexico declared independence from Spain, and again in 1853 when the Gadsden purchase made it part of the United States, though Arizona didn\'t become a state until 1912. In the 1850s the Butterfield stage line was extended to Tucson, bringing adventurers, a few settlers, and more than a handful of outlaws. The arrival of the railroad in 1880 marked another spurt of growth, as did the opening of the University of Arizona in 1891.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tucson\'s 20th-century growth occurred after World War I, when veterans with damaged lungs sought the dry air and healing power of the sun, and again during World War II with the opening of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and the rise of local aeronautical industries. It was also around this time that air-conditioning made the desert climate hospitable year-round.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rodeo Lesson</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cowboys vied for the unofficial titles of best roper and rider at the end of the big cattle drives of the late 19th century. As their day jobs were curtailed in scope by the spread of railroads and the fencing-in of the West, they made the contests more formalized and the sport of rodeo was born.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The five standard events in contemporary rodeo are calf roping, bull riding, steer wrestling, saddle bronc-riding, and bareback bronc-riding. (\"Bronc\" is short for bronco, an unbroken range horse with a tendency to buck, or throw, a rider.) Two other events are recognized in championship competitions: single-steer roping and team roping. The barrel race, a saddle-horse race around a series of barrels, is a popular contest for women.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Participants pay entry fees, and the prize money won is their only compensation. More than half of all rodeos are independent of state and county fairs, livestock shows, or other attractions, and many are held in arenas devoted to the purpose. The equipment, however, is simple and may be improvised.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1929 the Rodeo Association of America was formed to regulate the sport. The contestants themselves took a hand in 1936 after a strike in Boston Garden and organized the Cowboy Turtles Association—\"turtles\" because they had been slow to act.

The current structure was made out of native materials by Franciscan missionaries between 1777 and 1797, and is owned by the Tohono O\'odham tribe.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The beauty of the mission, with elements of Spanish, baroque, and Moorish architectural styles, is highlighted by the stark landscape against which it is set, inspiring an early-20th-century poet to dub it the White Dove of the Desert. Inside, there\'s a wealth of painted statues, carvings, and frescoes. Paul Schwartzbaum, who helped restore Michelangelo\'s masterwork in Rome, supervised Tohono O\'odham artisans in the restoration of the mission\'s artwork, completed in 1997; Schwartzbaum has called the mission the Sistine Chapel of the United States. Mass is celebrated at 8:30 AM Tuesday-Friday in the church and three times on Sunday morning. Call ahead for information about special celebrations.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Across the parking lot from the mission, San Xavier Plaza has a number of crafts shops selling the handiwork of the Tohono O\'odham tribe, including jewelry, pottery, friendship bowls, and baskets with man-in-the-maze designs. www.sanxaviermission.org.

Hummingbirds, cactus wrens, rattlesnakes, scorpions, bighorn sheep, and prairie dogs all busy themselves in ingeniously designed habitats. An Earth Sciences Center has an artificial limestone cave and a hands-on meteor and mineral display. The coyote and javelina (wild, pig-like mammals with oddly oversized heads) exhibits have \"invisible\" fencing that separates humans from animals, and the Riparian Corridor section affords great underwater views of otters and beavers.

Archaeologists have divided this civilization, which lasted some 3,000 years, into three main periods: preclassic and late preclassic (2000 BC- AD 100, together), classic (AD 100-1000), and postclassic (AD 1000-1521). Considered the most advanced civilization in the ancient Americas, the Maya are credited with several major breakthroughs: a highly accurate calendar based on astronomical study; the mathematical concept of zero; hieroglyphic writing; and extraordinary ceremonial architecture. Although the Maya\'s early days were centered around the lowlands in the south-central region of Guatemala, Mayan culture spread north to the Yucatán Peninsula sometime around AD 987. Tulum, which was built during this period, is the only ancient Mayan city constructed right on the water.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Until the 1960s, Quintana Roo (a Mexican territory, not a state) was considered the most savage coast in Central America. The Caste Wars of the Yucatán, which began in 1847 and ended with a half-hearted truce in 1935, herded hardy Maya to this remote region. With the exception of <i>chicleros,</i> (men who tapped <i>zapote</i> or chicle trees for the Wrigley Chewing Gum Corporation), few non-Maya roamed here. Whites and <i>mestizos</i> were unwelcome because it was not safe.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">By the 1950s the Mexican government began giving tracts of land to the <i>chicleros</i> in hopes of colonizing Quintana Roo. At that time there were no roads. A few <i>cocals,</i> or coconut plantations, were scattered throughout the peninsula, headed by a handful of Mayan families.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1967 the Mexican government sought a location for an international tourist destination with the finest beaches, the most beautiful water, and the fewest hurricanes. A stretch of unpopulated sand at the northeast tip of the Yucatán Peninsula fit the bill. Soon after identifying Cancún as the fortunate winner, that locale, Quintana Roo became Mexico\'s 31st state.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The 1980s saw an initial surge in tourism with the advent of the Riviera Maya in 2000, this 96-km (60-mi) region stretching south from Puerto Morelos to Tulum developed into one of the world\'s most popular beach destinations, with Playa del Carmen the fastest growing city in Latin America.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Caste Wars</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When Mexico achieved independence from Spain in 1821, the Maya didn\'t celebrate. The new government didn\'t return their lost land or treat them with respect. In 1847 a Mayan rebellion began in Valladolid. The Indians were rising up against centuries of being relegated to the status of \"lower caste\" people. Hence the conflict was called the Guerra de las Castas, or \"War of the Castes.\" A year later, they had killed hundreds and the battle raged on.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Help for the embattled Mexicans arrived with a vengeance from Mexico City, Cuba, and the United States. By 1850 the Maya had been mercilessly slaughtered, their population plummeting from 500,000 to 300,000. Survivors fled to the jungles and held out against the government until its troops withdrew in 1915. The Maya controlled Quintana Roo from Tulum, their headquarters, and finally accepted Mexican rule in 1935.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It\'s the coast\'s most heavily advertised attraction, billed as \"nature\'s sacred paradise,\" with a network of buses, its own published magazines, and a collection of stores.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Among the most popular attractions are the Paradise River raft tour that takes you on a winding, watery journey through the jungle; the Butterfly Pavilion, where thousands of butterflies float dreamily through a botanical garden while New Age music plays in the background; and an ocean-fed aquarium where you can see local sea life drifting through coral heads and sea fans.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The park has a Wild Bird Breeding Aviary, nurseries for both abandoned flamingo eggs and sea turtles, and a series of underwater caverns that you can explore by snorkeling or snuba (a hybrid of snorkeling and scuba). A replica Mayan village includes a colorful cemetery with catacomb-like caverns underneath; traditional music and dance ceremonies (including performances by the famed <i>Voladores de Papantla</i>—the Flying Birdmen of Papantla) are performed here at night. But the star show is the evening \"Spectacular Mexico Night Show,\" which tells the history of Mexico through song and dance.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The list of Xcaret\'s attractions goes on and on: you can visit a dolphinarium, a bee farm, a manatee lagoon, a bat cave, an orchid and bromeliad greenhouse, an edible-mushroom farm, and a small zoo. You can also visit a scenic tower that takes you 240 feet up in the air for a spectacular view of the park.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although Xcaret has 11 restaurants, many visitors bring their own lunches and take advantage of picnic tables scattered throughout the park. The entrance fee covers only access to the grounds and the exhibits; all other activities and equipment—from sea treks and dolphin tours to lockers and swim gear—are extra. You can buy tickets from any travel agency or major hotel along the coast. www.xcaret.com. COST: $59.

You walk through the underground passages, past stalactites and stalagmites, until you reach the cenote with its various shades of deep green. There is also a canopy tour and one cenote where you can swim. You don\'t want to miss this one. www.aktunchen.com. COST: $24, including 1-hr tour. OPEN: Daily 9-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Tulum</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tulum is one of the few Mayan cities known to have been inhabited when the conquistadores arrived in 1518. In the 16th century it functioned as a safe harbor for trade goods from rival Mayan factions; it was considered neutral territory, where merchandise could be stored and traded in peace. The city reached its height when traders, made wealthy through the exchange of goods, for the first time outranked Mayan priests in authority and power. When the Spaniards arrived, they forbade the Mayan traders to sail the seas, and commerce among the Maya died.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tulum has long held special significance for the Maya. A key city in the League of Mayapán (AD 987-1194), it was never conquered by the Spaniards, although it was abandoned about 75 years after the conquest. For 300 years thereafter it symbolized the defiance of an otherwise subjugated people; it was one of the last outposts of the Maya during their insurrection against Mexican rule in the War of the Castes, which began in 1846. Uprisings continued intermittently until 1935, when the Maya ceded Tulum to the Mexican government.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the entrance to the ruins you can hire a guide for $25, but keep in mind that some of their information is more entertainment than historical accuracy. (Disregard that stuff about virgin sacrifices atop the altars.) Although you can see the ruins in two hours, you might want to allow extra time for a swim or a stroll on the beach.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The first significant structure is the two-story <b>Templo de los Frescos,</b> to the left of the entryway. The temple\'s vault roof and corbel arch are examples of classic Mayan architecture. Faint traces of blue-green frescoes outlined in black on the inner and outer walls refer to ancient Mayan beliefs (the clearest frescoes are hidden from sight now that you aren\'t allowed to enter the temple). Reminiscent of the Mixtec style, the frescoes depict the three worlds of the Maya and their major deities, and are decorated with stellar and serpentine patterns, rosettes, and ears of maize and other offerings to the gods. One scene portrays the rain god seated on a four-legged animal—probably a reference to the Spaniards on their horses.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The largest and most famous building, the <b>Castillo</b> (Castle), looms at the edge of a 40-foot limestone cliff just past the Temple of the Frescoes. Atop it, at the end of a broad stairway, is a temple with stucco ornamentation on the outside and traces of fine frescoes inside the two chambers. (The stairway has been roped off, so the top temple is inaccessible.) The front wall of the Castillo has faint carvings of the Descending God and columns depicting the plumed serpent god, Kukulcán, who was introduced to the Maya by the Toltecs. To the left of the Castillo is the <b>Templo del Díos Descendente</b>—so called for the carving of a winged god plummeting to earth over the doorway.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A few small altars sit atop a hill at the north side of the cove with a good view of the Castillo and the sea.

Lift tickets, running around EUR 35 for a day\'s pass, are significantly less expensive than at major U.S. resorts.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To Italian skiers, a weeklong holiday on the slopes is known as a <i>settimana bianca</i> (white week). Ski resort hotels in Piedmont and Valle d\'Aosta encourage these getaways by offering six- and seven-day packages, and though they\'re designed with the domestic market in mind, you can get a bargain by taking advantage of the offers.

The emphasis here is on quality rather than quantity: 25 works of art from the Agnelli private collection are on permanent display, along with temporary exhibitions. There are four magnificent scenes of Venice by Canaletto (1697-1768); two splendid views of Dresden by Canaletto\'s nephew, Bernardo Bellotto (1720-80); several works by Manet (1832-83), Renoir (1841-1919), Matisse (1869-1954), and Picasso (1881-1973); and fine examples of the work of Italian futurist painters Balla (1871-1958) and Severini (1883-1966). The gallery is located on the top floor of the <b>Lingotto,</b> a former FIAT factory that was completely transformed between 1982 and 2002 by architect Renzo Piano.

The castle, which used a double ring of walls for its defense, is the sort imagined by schoolchildren, with pointed towers, portcullises, and spiral staircases. The 15th-century courtyard surrounded by wooden balconies is elegantly decorated with well-preserved frescoes. Inside you can see the kitchen, with an enormous fireplace that provided central heat in winter; the armory; and the spacious, well-lighted rooms used by the lord and lady of the manor. If you have time to visit only one castle in Valle d\'Aosta, this should be it. COST: EUR 5.

The coming of the railway inspired the loggers and saloon owners of Granville to incorporate as a city: on April 6, 1886, Granville Townsite, with a population of about 400, became the City of Vancouver, named after the British explorer who had toured the inlet here in 1792.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The railway, along with Canadian Pacific\'s fleet of clipper ships, gave Vancouver a full week\'s edge over the California ports in shipping tea and silk to New York. Lumber, fish, and coal from British Columbia\'s hinterland—resources that are still the backbone of the provincial economy, also flowed through the port to world markets. The same ships and trains brought immigrants from all corners of the earth, helping the population grow exponentially to today\'s 2 million.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The Great Hall displays dramatic cedar poles, bentwood boxes, and canoes adorned with traditional Northwest Coast painted designs. On clear days, the gallery\'s 50-foot-tall windows reveal a striking backdrop of mountains and sea. Another highlight is the work of the late Bill Reid, one of Canada\'s most respected Haida artists. In <i>The Raven and the First Men</i> (1980), carved in yellow cedar, he tells a Haida story of creation. Reid\'s gold-and-silver jewelry work is also on display, as are exquisite carvings of gold, silver, and argillite (a black shale found on Haida Gwaii, also known as the Queen Charlotte Islands) by other First Nations artists. The museum\'s visible storage section displays, in drawers and cases, thousands of examples of tools, textiles, masks, and other artifacts from around the world. The Koerner Ceramics Gallery contains 600 pieces from 15th- to 19th-century Europe. Behind the museum are two Haida houses, set on the cliff over the water. Free guided tours—given twice daily in summer, usually at 11 and 2 (call to confirm times)—are very informative. For an extra C$5 you can rent a VUEguide, an electronic device which senses where you are in the museum and shows relevant artist interviews, archival footage, and photographs of the artifacts in their original settings, on a hand-held screen. Arthur Erickson designed the cliff-top structure that houses the MOA, which also has a book and fine-art shop and a summertime café. To reach the museum by transit, take UBC Bus 4 from Granville Street or Bus 44 from Burrard Street downtown to the university loop, a 10-minute walk from the museum.

How do you learn about the catch of the day? A visit to the Rialto\'s <i>pescheria</i> (fish market) is more instructive than any book, and never be afraid to ask a restaurant\'s recommendation: it\'s what a local would do.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Dining options in Venice range from the ultra-high end, where jackets and ties are a must, to the very casual. Once staunchly traditional, many restaurants have renovated their menus along with their dining rooms, creating dishes that blend classic Venetian elements with ingredients far less common to the lagoon environs. Mid-range restaurants are often more willing to make the break, offering innovative options while keeping dishes like <i>sarde in saor</i> and <i>fegato alla veneziana</i> (calves\' liver and onions) available as mainstays. The best places often have limited seating, so be sure to reserve ahead.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">No Header</h2><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Going Bàcaro</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You can sample delightful regional wines and scrumptious <i>cicchetti</i> (finger foods) in <i>bàcari</i> (wine bars), a great Venetian tradition. For centuries, locals have gathered at these neighborhood spots to chat over a small glass of <i>sfuso</i> (wine on tap). <i>Crostini</i> (toast topped with a fish, meat, or vegetable combinations) are popular cicchetti, as are small sandwiches, crescents of melon wrapped with prosciutto, marinated seafood salads, and toothpick-speared items such as roasted peppers, marinated artichokes, deep-fried mozzarella balls, and <i>polpette</i> (meatballs).</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wading Through the Acqua Alta</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are two ways to get anywhere in Venice: walking, and by water. Occasionally you walk <i>through</i> water, when falling barometers, southeasterly winds, and even a full moon may exacerbate normally higher fall and spring tides. The result is <i>acqua alta</i>—flooding in the lowest parts of town, especially Piazza San Marco, and lasting a few hours until the tide recedes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Venetians handle the high waters with aplomb, donning waders and erecting temporary walkways, but they\'re well aware of the damage caused by the flooding and the threat it poses to their city. The Moses Project, underwater gates that would close off the lagoon when high tides threaten, is still in progress. The expensive works have altered the lagoon-scape, and still represent a much-debated response to an emotionally charged problem, particularly after the historic tide in December 2008. How to protect Venice from high tides—as well as high use and lagoon-altering wave action caused by powerboats—are among the city\'s most contentious issues.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

However, <i>I Frari</i> (as it\'s known locally) contains some of the most brilliant paintings in any Venetian church. Visit the sacristy first, to see Giovanni Bellini\'s 1488 triptych <i>Madonna and Child with Saints</i> in all its mellow luminosity, painted for precisely this spot. The Corner Chapel on the other side of the chancel is graced by Bartolomeo Vivarini\'s (1415-84) 1474 altarpiece <i>St. Mark Enthroned and Saints John the Baptist, Jerome, Peter, and Nicholas,</i> of similar exquisite detail and color. There is also a fine sculpture of Saint John the Baptist here by Jacopo Sansovino. You can see the rapid development of Venetian Renaissance painting by contrasting Bellini and Vivarini with the heroic energy of Titian\'s <i>Assumption,</i> over the main altar, painted only 30 years later. Unveiled in 1518, this work was not initially accepted by the church, precisely because of the innovative style and bright colors, especially Titian\'s trademark red, which would make it famous.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Titian\'s beautiful <i>Madonna di Ca\' Pesaro,</i> in the left aisle, was modeled after his wife, who died in childbirth. The painting took almost 10 years to complete, and in it Titian totally disregarded the conventions of his time by moving the Virgin out of center frame and making the saints active participants. On the same side of the church, look at the spooky, pyramid-shaped monument to the sculptor Antonio Canova (1757-1822). Across the nave is a neoclassical 19th-century monument to Titian, executed by two of Canova\'s pupils. COST: EUR 3, Chorus pass EUR 9. OPEN: Mon.-Sat. 9-6, Sun. 1-6. Vaporetto:San Tomà. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Basilica di San Marco</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">An opulent synthesis of Byzantine and Romanesque styles, Venice\'s gem is laid out in a Greek-cross floor plan and topped with five plump domes. It didn\'t become the cathedral of Venice until 1807, but its role as the <i>Chiesa Ducale</i> (doge\'s private chapel) gave it immense power and wealth. The original church was built in 828 to house the body of Saint Mark the Evangelist. His remains, filched from Alexandria by the doge\'s agents, were supposedly hidden in a barrel under layers of pickled pork to sneak them past Muslim guards. The escapade is depicted in the 13th-century mosaic above the door farthest left of the front entrance, one of the earliest mosaics on the heavily decorated facade; look closely to see the church as it appeared at that time.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A 976 fire destroyed most of the original church. It was rebuilt and reopened in 1094, and for centuries it would serve as a symbol of Venetian wealth and power, endowed with all the riches admirals and merchants could carry off from the Orient, to the point where it earned the nickname \"Chiesa d\'Oro\" (Golden Church). The four bronze horses that prance and snort over the doorway are copies of sculptures that victorious Venetians took from Constantinople in 1204 after the fourth crusade (the originals are in the Museo di San Marco). The rich, colorful exterior decorations, including the numerous different marble columns, all came from the same source. Look for a medallion of red porphyry in the floor of the porch inside the main door. It marks the spot where, in 1177, Doge Sebastiano Ziani orchestrated the reconciliation between Barbarossa—the Holy Roman emperor—and Pope Alexander III. Dim lighting, galleries high above the naves—they served as the <i>matroneum</i> (women\'s gallery)—the <i>iconostasis</i> (altar screen), and the single massive Byzantine chandelier all seem to wed Christianity with the Orient, giving San Marco its exotic blend of majesty and mystery.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The basilica is famous for its 43,055 square feet of mosaics, which run from floor to ceiling thanks to an innovative roof of brick vaulting. Many of the original windows were filled in to make room for even more artwork. At midday, when the interior is fully illuminated, the mosaics truly come alive, the shimmer of their tiny gold tiles becoming nothing short of magical. The earliest mosaics are from the 11th and 12th centuries, and the last were added in the early 1700s. One of the most recent is the <i>Last Judgment,</i> believed to have been designed by Tintoretto (1518-94), on the arch between the porch and the nave. Inside the main entrance, turn right on the porch to see the Book of Genesis depicted on the ceiling. Ahead through a glass door, 13th-century mosaics depict Saint Mark\'s life in the <b>Cappella Zen</b> (Zen Chapel). The <b>Cappella della Madonna di Nicopeia,</b> in the left transept, holds the altar icon that many consider Venice\'s most powerful protector. In nearby <b>Cappella della Madonna dei Mascoli,</b> the life of the Virgin Mary is depicted in fine 15th-century mosaics, believed to be based on drawings by Jacopo Bellini (1400-71) and Andrea Mantegna (1431-1506).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the <b>Santuario</b> (Sanctuary), the main altar is built over the tomb of Saint Mark, its green marble canopy lifted high on carved alabaster columns. Perhaps even more impressive is the <b>Pala d\'Oro,</b> a dazzling gilt silver screen encrusted with 1,927 precious gems and 255 enameled panels. Originally commissioned (976-978) in Constantinople by Doge Orseolo I, it was enlarged and embellished over four centuries by master craftsmen and wealthy merchants. The bronze door leading from the sanctuary into the sacristy is by Jacopo Sansovino. In the top left corner the artist included a self-portrait, and above that, he pictured friend and fellow artist Titian (1485-1576). The <b>Tesoro</b> (Treasury), entered from the right transept, contains many treasures carried home from conquests abroad.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Climb the steep stairway to the <b>Galleria</b> and the <b>Museo di San Marco</b> for the best overview of the basilica\'s interior. From here you can step outdoors for a sweeping panorama of Piazza San Marco and out over the lagoon to San Giorgio. The displays focus mainly on the types of mosaic and how they have been restored over the years. But the highlight is a close-up view of the original gilt bronze horses that were once on the outer gallery. The four were most probably cast in Rome and taken to Constantinople, where the Venetians pillaged them after sacking that city. When Napoléon sacked Venice in 1797, he took them to Paris. They were returned after the fall of the French Empire, but came home \"blind\"—their big ruby eyes had been sold.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Be aware that guards at the basilica door turn away anyone with bare shoulders, midriff, or knees: no shorts, short skirts, or tank tops are allowed.

The Olmec thrived here between 1,200 BC and AD 900, though there are few surviving examples of Olmec architecture. Instead, they\'re best remembered for the massive carved stone heads, a few of which are in the archaeological museum in Xalapa.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Olmec were replaced by the Totonac, whose last legacy is the city of El Tajín in the northern part of the state, near present-day Papantla. Although you\'ll see architectural influences from other cultures—notably the Maya—El Tajín is unlike anywhere else. The style is typified by the hundreds of indentations in the Pyramid of the Niches. This city remained powerful until about AD 1200, when it was abandoned. Archaeologists speculate that it had grown too large to support its population.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Later Totonac cities include Cempoala, which was occupied at the time of the Spanish conquest. Its residents, who had been forced to pay tribute to the more powerful Aztecs, formed an alliance with the Spanish and helped them establish their first town in the New World, called La Villa Rica del la Vera Cruz. It was near present-day Veracruz. The Totonac also embraced Catholicism, and by 1523 the Franciscans were preaching to the population.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">During the colonial period, which lasted until the early 19th century, Veracruz was the most important port in the New World. Invaders laid siege to the city time and time again. Veracruz is known as the \"city four times heroic\" because it repeatedly resisted invasion—first the French during the \"Pastry War\" in 1838, then the Americans during the Mexican-American War in 1847, the French again in 1866, then the Americans again in 1914.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Happiness in a Seafood Shack</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Some of Mexico\'s most delicious dishes come from Veracruz. The emphasis is on <i>pescado</i> (fish) and <i>mariscos</i> (shellfish). Some of the best places to eat in the region are the family-run seafood shacks you often find lining the beaches. Just ask for the <i>platillo del día.</i> This \"dish of the day\" is always fresh and served with a flourish.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many specialties show the influence of the Spanish and African communities of nearby Cuba, including the state\'s signature dish, <i>huachinango a la veracruzana</i> (red snapper in the Veracruz style, which means it\'s simmered in tomatoes, onions, garlic, green olives, and capers). Another dish with a similar influence is <i>salpicón de jaiba,</i> a spicy crabmeat salad usually prepared with tomatoes, capers, and peppers. Other dishes reflect African ties in their use of beans, plantains, yucca, taro, white sweet potatoes, and especially peanuts, which appear in the classic <i>puerco encacahuatado</i> (pork in peanut sauce) and the bracing <i>salsa macha,</i> made by grinding peanuts with garlic, chiles, and olive oil.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You\'ll find peanut ice cream all over the state, as well as other <i>nieves</i> made with mangos, papayas, and other local fruits. Another sweet-tooth tempter is <i>buñuelos veracruzanos,</i> golden doughnuts that are dipped in a sugar and cinnamon mix. Look out for the charge of <i>toritos</i> (little bulls), a heady alcoholic punch made with cane liquor, milk, and tropical fruit pulp or peanuts.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The main exhibits include a tank with 2,000 species of marine life native to the Gulf of Mexico, including manta rays, barracudas, and sea turtles. Other tanks display tiger sharks and gentle manatees that enjoy interacting with the crowds. Kids love the touch tanks. A guided immersion tank ($27 adults; $14 kids) offers daring visitors the chance to go nose to nose with the sharks. www.acuariodeveracruz.com. COST: $6 general.

The city was hidden until 1785, when a Spanish engineer happened upon it. Early theories attributed the complex—believed to be a religious center—to a settlement of Maya-related Huasteca, one of the most important cultures of Veracruz. Because of its immense size and unique architecture, scholars now believe it may have been built by a distinct El Tajín tribe with ties to the Maya. Although much of the site has been restored, many structures are still hidden under jungle.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">El Tajín is thought to have reached its peak between AD 600 and 1200. During this time hundreds of structures of native sandstone were built here, including temples, double-storied palaces, ball courts, and hundreds of houses. But El Tajín was already an important religious and administrative center during the first three centuries AD. Its influence is in part attributed to the fact that it had large reserves of cacao beans, used as currency in pre-Hispanic times.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Evidence suggests that the southern half of the uncovered ruins—the area around the lower plaza—was reserved for ceremonial purposes. Its centerpiece is the 60-foot-high <b>Pirámide de los Nichoes</b> (Pyramid of the Niches), one of the finest pre-Columbian buildings in Mexico. The finely wrought seven-level structure has 365 coffers—one for each day of the solar year—built around its seven friezes. The reliefs on the pyramid depict the ruler, 13-Rabbit—all the rulers\' names were associated with sacred animals—and allude also to the Tajín tribe\'s main god, the benign Quetzalcóatl. One panel on the pyramid tells the tale of heroic human sacrifice and of the soul\'s imminent descent to the underworld, where it is rewarded with the gift from the gods of sacred <i>pulque,</i> a milky alcoholic beverage made from cactus.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just south of the pyramid is the I-shape <b>Juego de Pelotas Sur</b> (Southern Ball Court). This is one of more than 15 ball courts—more than at any other site in Mesoamerica—where the sacred pre-Columbian ball game was played. The game is somewhat similar to soccer—players used a hard rubber ball that could not be touched with the hands, and suited up in pads and body protectors—but far more deadly. Intricate carvings at certain ball courts indicate that games ended with human sacrifice. It\'s believed that the winner of the match won the opportunity to ask a question of the gods in exchange for his sacrifice. Depending on the importance of his question, his sacrifice could be anything from minor body mutilation to his very life. It is surmised that the players involved in these sacrificial games were high-ranking members of the priest or warrior classes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the north, <b>El Tajín Chico</b> (Little El Tajín) is thought to have been the secular part of the city, with mostly administrative buildings and the elite\'s living quarters. Floors and roofing were made with volcanic rock and limestone. The most important structure here is the <b>Complejo de los Columnos</b> (Complex of the Columns). The columns once held up the concrete ceilings, but early settlers in Papantla removed the stones to construct houses. If you\'re prepared to work your way through the thick jungle, you can see some more recent finds along the dirt paths that lead over the nearby ridges.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You can leave bags at the visitor center at the entrance, which includes a restaurant and a small museum that displays some pottery and sculpture and tells what little is known of the site. Excellent guided tours are available in English and Spanish and cost about $20 per group. A performance by some voladores normally takes place at midday and sometimes up to five times daily. Start early to avoid the midday sun, and take water, a hat, and sunblock. To get here, take a shuttle bus. Head down Calle 20 de Noviembre until you hit Calle Francisco Madero. Cross the street and wait in front of the gas station for an el tajín shuttle bus. The $1 trip takes about 20 minutes. www.inah.gob.mx. COST: $4.80.

Although the bush can resemble a wasteland, with short brown stubble and bare trees, it does improve game viewing, and most other adventure activities are more comfortable in the cooler weather. This is also the time when the mosquitoes are less active, although it remains a malaria area year-round, and precautions should always be taken.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The rainy season starts sometime around late October and generally stretches well into April. With the first rains also comes the \"time of the bugs,\" with tsetse flies, mosquitoes, and the harmless but aptly named stink bug seemingly running the show for a couple of months. Of course, the abundance of insect life also leads to great bird-watching. Although the rain showers tend to be of the short and spectacular kind, they can interfere with some activities, especially if your visit is a short one. Try to arrange your activities for the early hours, as the rain generally falls in the late afternoon.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Peak flow is achieved in late April and May, when rafting and visiting Livingstone Island might not be possible. Make sure your visit does not coincide with school vacations in South Africa, as the area tends to get very full.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Though the Zimbabwean side may offer more panoramic views, the Zambian side—especially the <b>Knife Edge</b> (a sharp headland with fantastic views)—allows you to stand virtually suspended over the Boiling Pot (the first bend of the river after the falls), with the deafening water crashing everywhere around you. From around May to August the falls are a multisensory experience, though you\'ll get absolutely drenched if you venture onto the Knife Edge, and there may be too much spray to see the bottom of the gorge. If you get the sun behind you, you\'ll see that magic rainbow. A network of paths leads to the main viewing points; some are not well protected, so watch your step and wear good, safe shoes, especially at high water, when you are likely to get dripping wet. You will have dramatic views of the full 1½ km (1 mi) of the ironstone face of the falls, the Boiling Pot directly below, the railway bridge, and Batoka Gorge.

It\'s on many visitors\' must-see lists, and there is no shortage of companies willing to oblige.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In summer (roughly April to October), about 85 orca, or killer whales (they\'re actually large dolphins, but that makes them no less exciting to see), reside in the Strait of Georgia between Vancouver and Victoria. They live in pods, and because their movements are fairly predictable, chances are high that you will see a pod on any given trip. Some operators claim sighting rates of 90%; others offer guaranteed sightings, meaning that you can repeat the tour free of charge until you spot a whale.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\'s actually not unheard of to see whales from a BC Ferry en route to Victoria—but the ferries don\'t alter their routes to take advantage of whale-watching, so your best bet is to take a dedicated tour. A number of companies leave from Victoria\'s Inner Harbour, a few are based in Richmond (near Vancouver), and others leave from Sidney and Sooke, outside of Victoria.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Not all tours are alike, and the kind of boat you choose determines the kind of experience you\'re likely to have—though most companies have naturalists on board as guides, as well as hydrophones that, if you get close enough, allow you to listen to the whales singing and vocalizing.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Motor launches, which carry from 30 to more than 80 passengers, are comfortable, with washrooms, protection from the elements, and even snack and drink concessions. They\'re still relatively small boats, though, so if you\'re not a good sailor it\'s wise to wear a seasickness band or take anti-nausea medication.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Zodiacs are open inflatable boats that carry about 12 passengers. They are smaller and more agile than cruisers and offer both an exciting ride bouncing over the waves and an eye-level view of the whales. Passengers are supplied with warm, waterproof survival suits. Zodiac tours are not recommended for people with back or neck problems, pregnant women, or small children.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Note that the kind of boat you choose does not affect how close you can get to the whales. For the safety of whales and humans, government and industry regulations require boats to stay at least 100 meters from the pods, though closer encounters are possible if whales approach a boat when its engine is off.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">And, although the focus is on whales, you also have a good chance of spotting marine birds, Dahl\'s porpoises, dolphins, seals, sea lions, minke, gray, and humpback whales as well as other marine life. And, of course, there\'s the scenery of forested islands and distant mountains.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are dozens of whale-watching operators in the area. Some of the more established are:</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Great Pacific Adventures</b> offers year-round tours with both Zodiacs and covered vessels. Boats are equipped with hydrophones and all guides are marine biologists. In summer a 3-hour tour starts at C$89. 811 Wharf St.tel. 250/386-2277 or 877/733-6722. www.greatpacificadventures.com.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Ocean Explorations</b> conducts 3-hour whale-watching trips in summer and 2-hour marine tours in winter—all on hydrophone-equipped Zodiacs with qualified naturalists as guides.

Seaport Pl., Sidney. tel. 250/656-7224. www.tseycumtours.com.</div><div><i>Ocean Magic II,</i> a 74-passenger cruiser that combines four hours of whale-watching with a trip from Vancouver to Victoria. Run by <b>Prince of Whales</b>, one of the bigger whale-watching operators, the cruiser leaves downtown Vancouver daily at 7:30 AM, arrives in Victoria\'s Inner Harbour in time for lunch, and returns for Vancouver at 3:30. Passengers can opt to stay in Victoria, add a trip to the Butchart Gardens, or return by floatplane or ferry. Fares are C$149 one way, C$248 round-trip. tel. 250/383-4884 or 888/383-4884. www.princeofwhales.com.</div><div>Vancouver Island has two other whale-watching hot spots: Johnstone Strait, off Telegraph Cove on the island\'s northeast coast, has—in summer—one of the world\'s largest populations of orca and is an important center of whale research. Tofino and Ucluelet, on the island\'s west coast, draw whale-watchers every March and April when an estimated 20,000 Pacific gray whales cruise by on their annual migration.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Getting Around</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\'re short on time, it\'s easier—and cheaper—to visit without a car. Getting here by plane, floatplane, or bus and ferry is fairly seamless. Once here, you\'ll find most sights, restaurants, and hotels in the city\'s compact, walkable core, with Harbour ferries, horse-drawn carriages, double-decker buses, step-on tour buses, taxis, and pedicabs on hand to fill the gaps. For the more popular sights outside the core—Butchart Gardens, Hatley Castle, the Scenic Marine Drive—tour buses are your best bet. Taxis typically cost more than tours, and local public transit is geared more to commuters than sightseers.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A car, or bike, is handy (though not essential) if you\'re staying outside downtown in the Rockland or Oak Bay area. You will need a car if you\'re staying on the Saanich Peninsula or the Malahat, or if taking side trips to Sooke, the Cowichan Valley, or the Gulf Islands. Parking isn\'t especially expensive or hard to find in downtown Victoria, but parking enforcement is ruthless.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Biking is an excellent option in this, one of the most bike-friendly towns in North America. Bike paths lace downtown and run along much of the waterfront, long-haul car-free paths run to the ferry terminals and as far west as Sooke, and most buses and ferries carry bikes.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Its First Peoples Gallery, home to a genuine Kwakwaka\'wakw big house and a dramatically displayed collection of masks and other artifacts, is especially strong. The Living Land, Living Sea Gallery traces B.C.\'s natural heritage, from prehistory to modern-day climate change, in realistic dioramas. An Ocean Station exhibit gets kids involved in running a Jules Verne-style submarine. In the History Gallery, a replica of Captain Vancouver\'s ship, the HMS <i>Discovery,</i> creaks convincingly, and a re-created frontier town comes to life with cobbled streets, silent movies, and the rumble of an arriving train. Also on-site is an IMAX theater showing <i>National Geographic</i> films on a six-story-high screen. Optional one-hour tours, included in the admission price, run roughly twice a day in summer and less frequently in winter. Most focus on a particular gallery, though the 90-minute Highlights Tour touches on all galleries. The museum\'s annual special exhibits, usually held between April and October, often attract crowds. In 2008 and into early 2009, Free Spirit: Stories of You, Me and BC, will celebratethe province\'s 150th anniversary through the recollections of ordinary, and famous, British Columbians. You can skip ticket lines by booking online.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The museum complex has several more interesting sights, beyond the expected gift shop and café.

Saturated with musical history and boasting one of the world\'s greatest concert venues (the Musikverein), two of the world\'s greatest symphony orchestras (Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna Symphony), and one of the top opera houses (the Staatsoper), it\'s no wonder that music and the related politics are subjects of daily conversation.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Music lovers can tread in the footprints of the mighty, seeing where masterpieces were committed to paper or standing where a long-loved work was either praised or damned at its first performance. Many former musicians\' residences are open as museums. The most famous apartments are where Mozart wrote his last three symphonies and Beethoven\'s Pasqualatihaus. Unlike most of Vienna\'s composers, Schubert was a native of Vienna and you can visit <b>Schubert\'s Birthplace</b> (Nussdorferstrasse 54, 9th District. tel. 01/317-3601. U-Bahn: U2/Schottenring; Streetcar 37 or 38 to Canisiusgasse) as well as where he died at 4th District. tel. 01/581-6730.

Just across from the seating area, take a leisurely stroll through the almost empty gallery chambers. Seating starts at 6:30 PM, and there\'s plenty of time between courses to take your fill of the finest art available. The museum galleries close at 9 PM, so make sure you get your fill of art beforehand. The buffet remains open until 10:30 PM. However short your stay in Vienna, you\'ll want to visit one of the greatest art collections in the world, that of the Kunsthistorisches Museum. This is no dry-as-dust museum illustrating the history of art, as its name implies. Rather its collections of Old Master paintings reveal the royal taste and style of many members of the mighty House of Habsburg, who during the 16th and 17th centuries ruled over the greater part of the Western world. Today you can enjoy what this great ruling house assiduously (and in most cases, selectively) brought together through the centuries. The collection stands in the same class with those of the Louvre, the Prado, and the Vatican. It is most famous for the largest collection of paintings under one roof by the Netherlandish 16th-century master Pieter Brueghel the Elder—many art historians say that seeing his sublime <i>Hunters in the Snow</i> is worth a trip to Vienna. Brueghel\'s depictions of peasant scenes, often set in magnificent landscapes, distill the poetry and magic of the 16th century as few other paintings do. Room RX (Room 10) is the Brueghel shrine—on its walls, in addition to <i>Hunters in the Snow</i> hang <i>Children\'s Games,</i> the <i>Tower of Babel,</i> the <i>Peasant Wedding,</i> the <i>Nest-Robber,</i> and eight other priceless canvases. There are also hundreds of other celebrated Old Master paintings here. Even a cursory description would run on for pages. The large-scale works concentrated in the main galleries shouldn\'t distract you from the equal share of masterworks in the more intimate side wings.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Flemish wing also includes Rogier van der Weyden\'s <i>Crucifixion Triptych,</i> Holbein\'s <i>Portrait of Jane Seymour, Queen of England,</i> a fine series of Rembrandt portraits, and Vermeer\'s peerless <i>Allegory of the Art of Painting.</i> The grand style of the 17th century is represented by Rubens\'s towering altarpieces and his <i>Nude of Hélène Fourment.</i> In the Italian wing are works by Titian, including his <i>Portrait of Isabella d\'Este,</i> whose fiercely intelligent eyes make you realize why she was the first lady of the Renaissance, and Giorgione\'s <i>The Three Philosophers,</i> an enigmatic composition in uniquely radiant Venetian coloring. A short list of other highlights includes Raphael\'s <i>Madonna in the Meadow,</i> Correggio\'s <i>Jupiter Embracing Io,</i> Parmigianino\'s <i>Cupid Cutting a Bow,</i> Guercino\'s <i>Return of the Prodigal Son,</i> and Caravaggio\'s <i>Madonna of the Rosary.</i> One level down is the remarkable, less-visited <b>Kunstkammer,</b> displaying priceless objects created for the Habsburg emperors. These include curiosities made of gold, silver, and crystal (including Cellini\'s famous salt cellar \"La Saliera\"), and more exotic materials, such as ivory, horn, and gemstones. In addition, there are rooms devoted to Egyptian antiquities, Greek and Roman art, sculpture (ranging from masterworks by Tilmann Riemenschneider to Italian Mannerist bronzes, which the Habsburgs collected by the roomful) and the decorative arts, and numerous other collections. When your feet are ready to call a sit-down strike, repair to a comfy armchair in the wonderful café on the museum\'s second floor. Set under a grand dome, adorned with paintings, sculpture, and framed by gilt-tipped black marble columns, this spot is run by Gerstner, the famed pastry shop. www.khm.at. COST: EUR 10.

Built outside the city fortifications between 1714 and 1722, the complex originally served as the summer palace of Prince Eugene of Savoy; much later it became the home of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, whose assassination in 1914 precipitated World War I. Though the lower palace is impressive in its own right, it is the much larger upper palace, used for state receptions, banquets, and balls, that is acknowledged as Hildebrandt\'s masterpiece. The usual tourist entrance for the Upper Belvedere is the gate on Prinz-Eugen-Strasse (No. 27); for the Lower Belvedere, use the Rennweg gate (No. 6a). But for the most impressive view of the upper palace, approach it from the south garden closest to the South Rail Station. The upper palace displays a wealth of architectural invention in its facade, avoiding the main design problems common to palaces because of their size: monotony on the one hand and pomposity on the other. Hildebrandt\'s decorative manner here approaches the rococo, that final style of the Baroque era when traditional classical motifs all but disappeared in a whirlwind of seductive asymmetric fancy. The main interiors of the palace go even further: columns are transformed into muscle-bound giants, pilasters grow torsos, capitals sprout great piles of symbolic imperial paraphernalia, and the ceilings are aswirl with ornately molded stucco. The result is the finest rococo interior in the city. On the garden level you are greeted by the <b>Sala Terrena</b> whose massive Atlas figures shoulder the marble vaults of the ceiling and, it seems, the entire palace above. The next floor is centered around a gigantic Marble Hall covered with trompe l\'oeil frescoes, while down in the Lower Belvedere palace, there are more 17th-century salons, including the Grotesque Room painted by Jonas Drentwett and another Marble Hall (which really lives up to its name).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Both the upper and lower palaces of the Belvedere are museums devoted to Austrian painting. The Belvedere\'s main attraction is the collection of 19th- and 20th-century Austrian paintings, centering on the work of Vienna\'s three preeminent early-20th-century artists: Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, and Oskar Kokoschka. Klimt was the oldest, and by the time he helped found the Secession movement he had forged an idiosyncratic painting style that combined realistic and decorative elements in a way that was revolutionary. <i>The Kiss</i>—his greatest painting—is here on display. Schiele and Kokoschka went even further, rejecting the decorative appeal of Klimt\'s glittering abstract designs and producing works that ignored conventional ideas of beauty. www.belvedere.at. COST: EUR 12.50. OPEN: Daily 10-6; Lower Belvedere and Orangerie Wed. 10-9. U-Bahn:U1, U2, or U4 Karlsplatz, then Tram D/Belvederegasse. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Schönbrunn Palace</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Originally designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach in 1696 and altered considerably for Maria Theresa 40 years later, Schönbrunn Palace, the huge Habsburg summer residence, lies within the city limits, just a few subway stops west of Karlsplatz on line U4. The vast and elegant <b>gardens</b> are open daily from dawn until dusk, and multilingual guided tours of the palace interior are offered daily. A visit inside the palace is not included in most general city sightseeing tours, which offer either a tempting drive past it, or else a short half hour or so to explore. The four-hour commercial sightseeing-bus tours of Schönbrunn offered by tour operators cost several times what you\'d pay if you tackled the easy excursion yourself; their advantage is that they get you there and back with less effort. Go on your own if you want time to wander through the grounds.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most impressive approach to the palace and its gardens is through the front gate, set on Schönbrunner Schloss-Strasse halfway between the Schönbrunn and Hietzing subway stations. The vast main courtyard is ruled by a formal design of impeccable order and rigorous symmetry: wing nods at wing, facade mirrors facade, and every part stylistically complements every other. The courtyard, however, turns out to be a mere appetizer; the feast lies beyond. The breathtaking view that unfolds on the other side of the palace is one of the finest set pieces in all Europe and one of the supreme achievements of Baroque planning. Formal <i>Allées</i> (garden promenades) shoot off diagonally, the one on the right toward the zoo, the one on the left toward a rock-mounted obelisk and a fine false Roman ruin. But these, and the woods beyond, are merely a frame for the composition in the center: the sculpted marble fountain; the carefully planted screen of trees behind; the sudden, almost vertical rise of the grass-covered hill beyond, with the <b>Gloriette</b> a fitting crown.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Within the palace, the state salons are quite up to the splendor of the gardens, but note the contrast between these chambers and the far more modest rooms in which the rulers—particularly Franz Josef—lived and spent most of their time. Of the 1,441 rooms, 40 are open to the public on the regular tour, of which two are of special note: the Hall of Mirrors, where the six-year-old Mozart performed for Empress Maria Theresa in 1762 (and where he met seven-year-old Marie Antoinette for the first time, developing a little crush on her), and the Grand Gallery, where the Congress of Vienna (1815) danced at night after carving up Napoléon\'s collapsed empire during the day. Ask about viewing the ground-floor living quarters (Berglzimmer), where the walls are painted with palm trees, exotic animals, and tropical views. As you go through the palace, glance occasionally out the windows; you\'ll be rewarded by a better impression of the formal gardens, punctuated by hedgerows and fountains. These window vistas were enjoyed by rulers from Maria Theresa and Napoléon to Franz Josef. www.schoenbrunn.at. COST: Guided grand tour of palace interior (40 rooms) EUR 14.40, self-guided tour EUR 12.90. OPEN: Apr.-June, Sept., and Oct., daily 8:30-5; July and Aug., daily 8:30-6; Nov.-Mar., daily 8:30-4:30.

U-Bahn:U4/Schönbrunn. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Schatzkammer</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The entrance to the Schatzkammer, with its 1,000 years of treasures, is tucked away at ground level behind the staircase to the Hofburgkapelle. The elegant display is a welcome antidote to the monotony of the Imperial Apartments, for the entire Treasury was completely renovated in 1983-87, and the crowns and relics and vestments fairly glow in their surroundings. Here you\'ll find such marvels as the Holy Lance—reputedly the lance that pierced Jesus\'s side—the Imperial Crown (a sacred symbol of sovereignty once stolen on Hitler\'s orders), and the Saber of Charlemagne. Don\'t miss the Burgundian Treasure, connected with that most romantic of medieval orders of chivalry, the Order of the Golden Fleece. COST: EUR 10. OPEN: Wed.-Mon. 10-6. U-Bahn:U3/Herrengasse. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hofbibliothek</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hofbibliothek (formerly Court, now National, Library)). This is one of the grandest Baroque libraries in the world, a cathedral of books. Its centerpiece is the spectacular Prunksaal—the Grand Hall of the National Library—which probably contains more book treasures than any comparable collection outside the Vatican. The main entrance to the ornate reading room is in the left corner of Josefsplatz. Designed by Fischer von Erlach the Elder just before his death in 1723 and completed by his son, the Grand Hall is full-blown High Baroque, with trompe-l\'oeil ceiling frescoes by Daniel Gran. Usually twice a year, and lasting three to six months, special exhibits highlight some of the finest and rarest tomes, well documented in German and English. From 1782 Mozart performed here regularly at the Sunday matinees of Baron Gottfried van Swieten, who lived in a suite of rooms in the grand, palacelike library. Four years later the baron founded the Society of Associated Cavaliers, which set up oratorio performances with Mozart acting as conductor. Across the street at Palais Palffy Mozart reportedly first performed <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> before a select, private audience to see if it would pass the court censor. www.onb.ac.at.

Biblioteka restaurant is right in the wonderful Warsaw University Library; admire the architecture, read a book, but don\'t miss your feast. The Zamek Ujazdowski Center for Contemporary Art houses Qchnia Artystyczna, which serves Polish and Mediterranean cuisine. And Fabryka Trzciny in Praga will serve you not only art and music but also \"art-industrial\" food.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Classy Hotels</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Warsaw has two lovely boutique hotels, the smooth Rialto with its consistent art deco style, and the serene Le Regina, an oasis at the top of the Old Town. Old-world charm can be found at the glamorous Bristol and the resurrected Polonia Palace. International chains also offer top standards; look for the popular and upscale Westin, InterContinental, or Marriott.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Industrial Heritage</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Warsaw\'s Praga District has some interesting industrial heritage. The redbrick complex of the Koneser vodka distillery is worth a visit; it now houses, among other establishments, the Luksfera art gallery. Also in Praga, Fabryka Trzciny is a former factory turned art center. The whole city of Lódz is a real gold mine of industrial heritage, along with fashionable clubs, art galleries, and shopping centers.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The museum features a life-size plane, cobblestone streets, reconstructed sewers (vital transportation and evacuation lines during the battles), real objects, photographs, and also video footage and audio recordings. It is a day-by-day account of the heroic struggle of the insurgents, most of them twentysomething years old—often told in their own words. It is impossible not to be involved and moved by it. Allow a minimum of 2½ hours to see the exhibition with a guide. English-language guides are available, but to ensure that you have a guide, you should make a tour reservation on the museum Web site by e-mailing a request to the museum, especially in summer. It is possible to wander around on your own as well. Large groups (11-plus persons) must book their entry in advance. www.1944.pl. COST: zl4, free Sun. OPEN: Sept.-June, Wed.-Mon. 8-6 (Thurs. until 8); July and Aug., Wed.-Mon. 10-6 (Thurs. until 8). </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Park Lazienkowski</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The 180 acres of this park, commissioned during the late 18th century by King Slanislaw August Poniatowski, run along the Vistula escarpment, parallel to the Royal Route. Look for the peacocks that wander through the park and the delicate red squirrels that in Poland answer to the name \"Basia,\" a diminutive of Barbara. Of course, the best way to entice a squirrel to come near is to have some nuts in your hand. In the old coach houses on the east side of the park you\'ll find the <b>Muzeum Lowiectwa i Jezdziectwa</b> (Museum of Hunting. tel. 022/621-62-41), which contains a collection of stuffed birds and animals native to Poland. It is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 to 3; admission is zl5. One of the most beloved sights in Lazienki Park is the <b>Pomnik Fryderyka Chopina</b> (Chopin Memorial), a sculpture under a streaming willow tree that shows the composer in a typical romantic pose. In summer, outdoor concerts of Chopin\'s piano music are held here every Sunday afternoon. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Its grounds are equally stunning—they were landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted. A tour of the interior is impressive, but nothing beats attending a live debate on the House or Senate floor.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">White House</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">1600 Pennsylvania Avenue may be the best-known address in the United States. Every president but George Washington lived here, and many heads-of-state have passed through its hallowed halls. The self-guided tour lets you follow their footsteps through the historic rooms, including the East Room, Green Room, and State Dining Room. Note that it takes significant advance planning to visit the White House. See Chapter 5,\"Official Washington,\" for details.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Washington Monument</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The epitome of a landmark attraction, this 555-foot, 5-inch obelisk is visible from nearly everywhere in the city. Ride to the top to see views of the District, Maryland, and Virginia.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lincoln Memorial</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many people consider the Lincoln Memorial the city\'s most inspiring monument. In the center, the somber Daniel Chester French statue of the seated president gazes out over the Reflecting Pool. One of the best times to view the memorial itself is at night when lights and shadows play across Lincoln\'s face.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Jefferson Memorial</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Jefferson always admired the Pantheon in Rome, so architect John Russell Pope drew from the same source when he designed this graceful memorial facing the Tidal Basin. As an added bonus, one of the best views of the White House can be seen from the memorial\'s top steps.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Smithsonian Museums</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You can\'t pick one top Smithsonian museum because each is outstanding. Mostly flanking the National Mall, these illustrious galleries hold everything from Kermit the Frog to the <i>Spirit of St Louis,</i> the Hope Diamond, and Rodin\'s <i>Burghers of Calais.</i></div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">National Zoo</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The pandas may be the zoo\'s most famous attraction, but they\'re not the only highlight. Monkeys, elephants, and lions never fail to delight animal lovers, and more exotic residents, such as sloth bears, red pandas, clouded leopards, and Japanese giant salamanders, can be found on the Asia Trail.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">National Cathedral</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Like its 14th-century counterparts, this 20th-century cathedral has a nave, flying buttresses, transepts, and vaults that were built stone by stone. Unlike those historic buildings, the National Cathedral possesses a gargoyle in the shape of Darth Vader. For a unique experience, come for a tour and tea.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Arlington National Cemetery</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The serene hills across the Potomac from the Tidal Basin are the final resting place for some 300,000 members of the armed services, from Civil War casualties to fallen soldiers of the Iraq War. A visit here can be both sobering and deeply moving.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Dumbarton Oaks</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you have an affection for formal gardens, visit the 10-acre grounds of Dumbarton Oaks, one of the loveliest spots in the city.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Great Itineraries</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">One Day in Washington</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you have a day or less (and even a dollar or less!) in D.C., your sightseeing strategy is simple: take the metro to the Smithsonian stop and explore the area around the Mall. You\'ll be at the undisputed heart of the city—a beautiful setting in which you\'ll find America\'s greatest collection museums, with the city\'s spectacular monuments and the halls of government a stone\'s throw away.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As you face the Capitol, to your left are the <b>Museum of Natural History,</b> the <b>National Gallery of Art,</b> and the <b>National Archives.</b> To your right are the <b>Museum of African Art,</b> the <b>Hirshhorn Museum,</b> the <b>National Air and Space Museum,</b> and more. Head the other direction, toward the <b>Washington Monument,</b> and you\'re also on your way to the <b>World War II Memorial,</b> the <b>Lincoln Memorial,</b> the <b>Vietnam Veterans Memorial,</b> and more monuments to America\'s presidents and its past. A lover of American history and culture could spend a thoroughly happy month, much less a day, wandering the Mall and its surroundings.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>If you\'re here first thing in the morning:</b> You can hit monuments and memorials early. They\'re open 24 hours a day and staffed beginning at 8:00 AM. The outdoor sculpture garden at the <b>Hirshhorn</b> opens at 7:30, and the <b>Smithsonian Institution Building</b> (the \"Castle\") opens at 8:30. In the Castle you can grab a cup of coffee, watch an 18-minute film about D.C., and see examples of objects from many of the 18 Smithsonian museums.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>If you only have few hours in the evening:</b> Experience the beauty of monuments at dusk and after dark. Many people think they\'re even more striking when the sun goes down. National Park Service rangers staff most monuments until midnight.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Five Days in Washington</h2><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 1</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With more time at your disposal, you have a chance both to see the sights and to get to know the city. A guided bus tour is a good way to get yourself oriented; if you take one of the hop-on, hop-off tours we recommend under \"Day Tours &amp; Guides\" in the \"Essentials\" chapter at the back of this book, you\'ll get genuine insights without a lot of tourist hokum.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Because you can get on and off wherever you like, it\'s good idea to explore <b>Georgetown</b> and the <b>Washington National Cathedral</b> while on a bus tour; neither of which is easily accessible by metro. For lunch, consider the café at the <b>National Museum of the American Indian,</b> where they serve creative dishes inspired by native cultures.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 2</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Devote your next day to the Mall, where you can check out the museums and monuments that were probably a prime motivation for your coming to Washington in the first place. Keep in mind the <b>National Air and Space Museum</b> is the most crowded. The <b>National Museum of Natural History,</b> the <b>National Gallery of Art,</b> and the <b>Museum of American History</b> (when it reopens in summer 2008) are very popular as well. If you visit the <b>U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum,</b> plan on spending two to three hours.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Take time out for a walk from the <b>Washington Monument</b> to the <b>Lincoln Memorial</b> and around the <b>Tidal Basin,</b> where you can see the <b>Jefferson Memorial</b> and the <b>FDR Memorial,</b> and take a leisurely paddleboat ride around the cherry trees. If you\'re with kids on the Mall, take a break by riding the carousel.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Accomplish all of this and you\'ll have had a very full day. If you like a quick,\"just the highlights\" approach, you can take it all in. If you\'d rather linger at the museums and soak up the culture, there are a couple of strategies to consider: narrow your focus to one or two museums; visit the monuments and memorials in the evening; or give the Mall and vicinity a second day on your itinerary.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 3</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Make this your day on <b>Capitol Hill,</b> where you\'ll have the option of visiting the <b>Capitol,</b> the <b>U.S. Botanic Gardens,</b> the <b>Library of Congress,</b> the <b>Supreme Court,</b> and the <b>Folger Shakespeare Library.</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Call your senators or congressional representative in advance for passes to see Congress in session—a memorable experience. Likewise, check the Supreme Court\'s Web site (www.supremecourtus.gov) for dates of oral arguments. If you show up at court in the morning, you can gain admission for either a short (three-minute) visit or the full morning session.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 4</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Head to the <b>National Zoo</b> and say good morning to the pandas. If the weather\'s bad, you can still enjoy the numerous indoor animal houses. Then hop on the Metro to <b>Dupont Circle</b> for lunch. Walk west on P Street NW to <b>Georgetown,</b> where you can shop, admire the architecture, and people watch through the afternoon.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you got a good dose of Georgetown on your first day, consider instead hitting the <b>International Spy Museum,</b> which tends to be less crowded after 2 PM. From there you can walk over to the <b>Smithsonian American Art Museum</b> and <b>National Portrait Gallery,</b> which stay open until 7.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Day 5</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend the morning at <b>Arlington National Cemetery,</b> one of the Washington area\'s most moving experiences. While you\'re there, don\'t missing the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknowns, which takes place every hour or half hour, depending on the time of year. A short detour north of the cemetery brings you to the <b>Marine Corps War Memorial,</b> a giant bronze rendering of one of the most famous images in U.S. military history.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After your quiet, contemplative morning, head across town to spend the afternoon in the neighborhoods of <b>Adams-Morgan</b> and <b>Dupont Circle,</b> both of which have unusual shops, restaurants, and clubs. Lunch at one of Adams-Morgan\'s Ethiopian, El Salvadoran, or Mexican restaurants, and take in the Dupont Circle art scene—there\'s an assortment of galleries, as well as the renowned <b>Phillips Collection.</b></div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Like its 14th-century Gothic counterparts, the stunning National Cathedral (officially the Cathedral Church of St. Peter and St. Paul) has a nave, flying buttresses, transepts, and vaults that were built stone by stone. State funerals for presidents Eisenhower, Reagan, and Ford were held here, and the tomb of Woodrow Wilson, the only president buried in Washington, is on the nave\'s south side. The expansive view of the city from the Pilgrim Gallery is exceptional. The cathedral is Episcopalian, but it\'s the site of frequent ecumenical and interfaith services, as well as state events such as the funerals of presidents.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the grounds of the cathedral is the compact, English-style <b>Bishop\'s Garden.</b> Boxwoods, ivy, tea roses, yew trees, and an assortment of arches, bas-reliefs, and stonework from European ruins provide a counterpoint to the cathedral\'s towers. www.cathedral.org/cathedral. COST: Suggested tour donation $3. OPEN: Weekdays 10-5, Sat. 10-4, Sun. 8-6:30 (8-2:45 for worship only). Tours Mon.-Sat. 10-4, every 30 min. Gardens open dawn-dusk. Metro: Cleveland Park or Tenleytown. Take any 30 bus series. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">National Museum of African Art</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Opened in 1987, this unique underground building houses galleries, a library, photographic archives, and educational facilities. Its rotating exhibits present African visual arts, including sculpture, textiles, photography, archaeology, and modern art. Long-term installations explore the sculpture of sub-Saharan Africa, the art of Benin, the pottery of Central Africa, the archaeology of the ancient Nubian city of Kerma, and the artistry of everyday objects. The museum\'s educational programs include films with contemporary perspectives on African life, storytelling programs, festivals, and hands-on workshops for families, all of which bring Africa\'s oral traditions, literature, and art to life. Workshops and demonstrations by African and African-American artists offer a chance to meet and talk to practicing artists. If you\'re traveling with children, look for the museum\'s free guide to the permanent Images of Power and Identity exhibition. www.nmafa.si.edu. COST: Free. OPEN: Daily 10-5:30. Metro: Smithsonian. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">National Building Museum</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The open interior of this mammoth redbrick edifice is one of the city\'s great spaces and has been the site of many an inaugural ball. (The first ball was for Grover Cleveland in 1885; because the building wasn\'t finished at the time, a temporary wooden roof and floor were built.) The eight central Corinthian columns are among the largest in the world, rising to a height of 75 feet. Although they resemble Siena marble, each is made of 70,000 bricks that have been covered with plaster and painted. For years, the annual <i>Christmas in Washington</i> TV special has been filmed in this breathtaking hall.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The museum is devoted to architecture and the building arts. The permanent exhibit \"Washington: Symbol and City\" tells the story of the birth and evolution of the backwater that eventually became the nation\'s capital (beginning by debunking the myth that Washington was built on a swamp!). You can touch the perfectly scaled, intricately detailed models of the White House, the Capitol, the Washington Monument, and the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials, and look at original drawings, building plans, maps, videos, and photographs that trace the city\'s architectural history.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Central to the exhibit is the story of the Pierre L\'Enfant, the young French architect who created Washington\'s first comprehensive city plan in 1790—a design that transformed the city\'s layout from a chaotic town of tangled streets into a capital of boulevards and grand memorials, and still guides Washington\'s growth today.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are also a constant series of temporary exhibits: recent ones have covered environmentally sustainable architecture, Shakespeare\'s Globe Theatre, and Frank Lloyd Wright\'s Price Tower, the seminal architect\'s only skyscraper.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The building itself began life as known as the the Pension Building. It was erected between 1882 and 1887 to house workers who processed the pension claims of veterans and their survivors, an activity that intensified after the Civil War. The office is said to be the source of the term <i>red tape,</i> a reference to the material used to tie up veterans\' papers, both literally and figuratively. The architect, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\' General Montgomery C. Meigs, took as his inspiration Rome\'s Palazzo Farnese.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Before entering the building, walk down its F Street side. The terra-cotta frieze by Caspar Buberl between the first and second floors depicts soldiers marching and sailing in an endless procession around the building. Architect Meigs lost his eldest son in the Civil War, and, though the frieze depicts Union troops, he intended it as a memorial to all who were killed in the bloody war. Meigs designed the Pension Building with workers\' comfort in mind. Note the three \"missing\" bricks under each window that allowed for air to circulate and helped keep the building cool. Tours are offered at 12:30 Monday through Wednesday; 11:30, 12:30, and 1:30 Thursday through Saturday; and 12:30 and 1:30 Sunday. Family programs are available at 2:30 on weekends. www.nbm.org.

State Highway 1 takes you north, and about a half hour out of the city you hit the coast at Paremata. From here you can follow South Highway 1 straight up the Kapiti Coast, so called for the view of Kapiti Island. Alternatively, you can take the longer—but infinitely more scenic—drive around the Pauatahanui Inlet and Bird Sanctuary, following the road along the ridge of the rugged, winding, and windy Paekakariki Hill where stunning views of the coastline and Kapiti Island await you. Both routes lead to <b>Paekakariki</b> (pie-<i>kahk</i>-a-reeky), a small, artsy beach town.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Paekakariki\'s draw is the shore, but it\'s also the main entry point of <b>Queen Elizabeth Park</b> (Entrance on Wellington Rd.04/292-8625), more than 1,000 acres of fields and sand dunes along the coast. The park has a walking trail, horseback riding, mountain biking, and a playground. A little farther up the coast on State Highway 1 is <b>Lindale Farm</b> (tel. 04/297-0916), which is home to <b>Kapiti Cheeses and Ice Cream</b>. Along with terrific locally made cheeses, you can try decadent ice cream with Kiwi flavors, such as feijoa or fig and <i>manuka</i> honey (manuka is a kind of tea tree). The farm is just past Paekakariki\'s neighboring town, Paraparaumu.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Paraparaumu is the departure point for one of Wellington\'s best-kept secrets: <b>Kapiti Island</b> (Coastlands Parade. tel. 04/298-8195). The island has been a protected reserve since 1897 and is a fantastic place to hike. All pests have been eliminated from the island, and birdlife flourishes, including saddlebacks, stitchbirds, and colonies of little spotted and South Island brown kiwi. Don\'t be surprised if a curious and fearless weka bird investigates your daypack or unties your shoelaces. Climb to the more than 1,700-ft-high Tuteremoana lookout point.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The island\'s most famous inhabitant was the Ngati Toa chief Te Rauparaha, who took the island by ruse in 1822. From this stronghold, he launched bloodthirsty raids before he was captured in 1846. He died in 1849, but his burial place is a mystery.

The island has lots of walking tracks, great beaches for swimming, good picnic spots, and opportunities to see whales, dolphins, penguins, and other birds (sharp eyes may also pick out skinks and other small lizards, and giant weta insects on the paths). Because the boats carry a limited number of passengers to the island at a time, it\'s never crowded.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although the 62-acre island was opened as a DOC reserve in 1995, it has an interesting history. From the early 1880s until around 1980, it was used as a quarantine station by early European settlers for both humans and animals—including dogs, cattle, sheep, red deer, llamas, and other livestock—on their way into the country. During the world wars, it was also used as a place of internment for aliens considered a security threat.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1981 Matiu became a project of the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. Volunteers began planting trees that year to replace vegetation that had previously been cleared to allow grazing for quarantined animals. Many other native plants that flourished before the arrival of Europeans have also been replanted, and native insects such as wetas reintroduced. The island is now a breeding ground for a variety of seabirds.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The island is strictly a place to enjoy natural beauty for a few hours at a time. The few man-made structures on Matiu today include the old quarantine station, and gun emplacements from World War II—which were never used, and which remain on the southernmost summit of the island. An automated lighthouse built in 1900 to replace the original structure from 1866 also still sends out its southward beacon to ships traveling from Wellington Harbour.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The island can be reached by the Dominion Post East/West ferry service; there are nine round-trip runs made from Wellington Harbour per day.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Female loggerhead, Kemp\'s ridley, and other species living in the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico swim up to 2,000 mi to the Florida shore. By night they drag their 100- to 400-pound bodies onto the beach to the dune line. Then each digs a hole with her flippers, drops in 100 or so eggs, covers them up, and returns to sea.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The babies hatch about 60 days later. Once they burst out of the sand, the hatchlings must get to sea rapidly or risk becoming dehydrated from the sun or being caught by crabs, birds, or other predators.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Instinctively, baby turtles head toward bright light, probably because for millions of years starlight or moonlight reflected on the waves was the brightest light around, serving to guide hatchlings to water. But now light from beach development can lead the babies in the wrong direction, running to the street rather than the water. To help, many coastal towns enforce light restrictions during nesting months. Florida home owners are requested that their lights be dimmed on behalf of baby sea turtles.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At night, volunteers walk the beaches, searching for signs of turtle nests. Upon finding telltale scratches in the sand, they cordon off the sites, so beachgoers will leave the spots undisturbed. Volunteers also keep watch over nests when babies are about to hatch and assist if the hatchlings get disoriented.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\'s a hazardous world for baby turtles. They can die after eating tar balls or plastic debris, or they can be gobbled by sharks or circling birds. Only about 1 in 1,000 survives to adulthood. After reaching the water, the babies make their way to warm currents. East-coast hatchlings drift into the Gulf Stream, spending years floating around the Atlantic.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Males never return to land, but when females attain maturity, in 15-20 years, they return to shore to lay eggs. Remarkably, even after migrating hundreds and even thousands of miles out at sea, most return to the very beach where they were born to deposit their eggs. Each time they nest, they come back to the same stretch of beach. In fact, the more they nest, the more accurate they get, until eventually they return time and again to within a few feet of where they last laid their eggs. These incredible navigation skills remain for the most part a mystery despite intense scientific study.

The bears congregate throughout October and early November; it\'s not unusual to see them foraging on the outskirts of town in summer, too, when special patrols often work overtime to steer the majestic animals back into the wild. Beluga whales, which come to feed in the relatively warm waters of the Churchill River, are another draw, as are the northern lights.

The park truly feels alive when you see mud pots, steam vents, fumaroles, and paint pots—all different aspects of the park\'s geyser basins, and all intriguing. Beyond the geyser activity, seasonal changes in wildlife and vegetation make Yellowstone fascinating to visit over and over again.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though Old Faithful continues to spew routinely, even it has changed in recent years because of various factors. The geyser now erupts about every 94 minutes (up from 78 minutes in 1990), and it may look different each time. Monitoring shows that Old Faithful almost always spews forth the same amount of water at each eruption, but how it does so varies. Sometimes it shoots higher and faster, whereas other times it lasts longer but doesn\'t reach so high in the sky.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Other geyser basin features aren\'t so reliable. The force and nature of the various geysers depend on several factors, including the complex underground geology at Yellowstone. Rangers say the greatest threats to the geyser basin activity are earthquakes (which occur regularly in the region, though they are usually very small tremors) and the impact caused by people. In past years, for example, people threw hundreds of coins into the bright blue Morning Glory Pool. The coins eventually clogged the pool\'s water vents, causing it to change color to a sickly green. Though it has been cleaned and people are warned not to throw anything into it, the Morning Glory Pool has never regained its pristine color.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Besides of its unique geology, Yellowstone has many other faces. There are petrified forests and fossil remains of both plants and animals. The ongoing ecological development of the region draws widespread interest. The reintroduction of wolves to the ecosystem and efforts to control the movement of bison—to keep them from wandering out of the park during the winter months in search of food—are just two examples of issues that divide opinions on the management of Yellowstone.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bison leave the park in winter—mainly through the North and West entrances—in part because of overpopulation and the need to find adequate feed. Their movements are sometimes made easier by the winter grooming of Yellowstone roads for use by over-snow vehicles.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Wolves were brought back to Yellowstone in 1995. They acclimated so well that they quickly formed several packs, some of which have ventured outside the park\'s boundaries. (Wolves from Yellowstone\'s packs have been spotted as far south as northern Utah and Colorado.) Their presence has had a lasting effect on wildlife populations. The wolves feed on both elk and buffalo, and researchers have noted a significant decline in elk calf survival throughout the region as a result of wolf predation. Park rangers have also reported a significant decline in Yellowstone\'s coyote population. Since the wolves are bigger and stronger than coyotes, they kill coyotes or force them to find a new range.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When massive wildfires tore through Yellowstone in 1988, some believed it would take generations for the park to recover. Already, the park has begun to renew itself. Certainly, when you visit Yellowstone now you will see reminders of fires from 1988 and more recent fires in 2001 and 2002, but you will also see the new growth. Lodgepole-pine forests need fire to release their seeds, and once seeds get a start, trees grow quickly. The new growth provides excellent cover for animals, making it harder for visitors to see wildlife such as elk, deer, and bears.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">A World of Geological Wonders</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spouting geysers, bubbling mud pots, and hissing steam vents have earned fame for Yellowstone, which has the greatest concentration of thermal features in the country—nearly 10,000 of them all told.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The past eruptions of cataclysmic volcanoes helped to create the steaming, vaporous landscape of Yellowstone today. The heat from the magma (molten rock) under the Yellowstone Caldera continues to fuel the park\'s most famous geyser basins—West Thumb, Upper, Lower, Midway, and Norris—which contain most of Yellowstone\'s 200 to 250 active geysers.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Other traces of the geological past include the basaltic columns near Tower and the steam that hisses from Roaring Mountain. The molten lava beneath the Yellowstone Caldera, one of the world\'s most active volcanoes, has created two resurgent domes: Sour Creek, forming the eastern edge of Hayden Valley, and Mallard Lake, which overlooks Old Faithful from the Upper Geyser Basin, at Observation Point. In Firehole Canyon, the Firehole River runs between two lava flows; at West Thumb, a minor eruption created the Lake Yellowstone bay lined with hydrothermal features; in the park\'s forests, volcanic soils nurture lodgepole pine.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The superheated underground means Yellowstone is a constantly changing landscape. A geyser that is active one month may go dormant while a nearby thermal feature suddenly becomes quite intense. This potential for constant change makes Yellowstone a place where you can see something new and different each time you visit.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The lake has 141 mi of shoreline, less than one-third of it followed by the East Entrance Road and Grand Loop Road, along which you will often see moose, elk, waterfowl, and other wildlife. In winter you can sometimes see otters and coyotes stepping gingerly on the ice at the lake\'s edge. Many visitors head here for the excellent fishing—streams flowing into the lake give it an abundant supply of trout. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Old Faithful</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Almost every visitor includes the world\'s most famous geyser on his or her itinerary. Yellowstone\'s most predictable big geyser—although not its largest or most regular—sometimes reaches 180 feet, but it averages 130 feet. Sometimes it doesn\'t shoot as high, but in those cases the eruptions usually last longer. The mysterious plumbing of Yellowstone has lengthened Old Faithful\'s cycle somewhat in recent years, to every 94 minutes or so. To find out when Old Faithful is likely to erupt, check at the visitor center or at any of the lodging properties in the area. You can view the eruption from a bench just yards away, from the dining room at the lodge cafeteria, or from a guest room at the spectacular Old Faithful Inn (assuming you are lucky enough to spend the night there). The 1-mi hike to Observation Point yields yet another view—from above—of the geyser and its surrounding basin. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This stunning canyon is 23 mi long, but there is only one trail from rim to base.

Follow signs to Yosemite Village, and stop in at the Valley Visitor Center to pick up maps and brochures. Behind the center, walk through a small, re-created Ahwahneechee village. For more Native American lore, take a quick peek at the Yosemite Museum next door, where there\'s an impressive collection of baskets. If you\'re a photography buff, the nearby Ansel Adams Gallery is a must-see. Next, amble over to Sentinel Bridge, walk to its center, and take in the best view of Half Dome, with its reflection in the Merced River. Before you leave the Village, stop at the Village Store or a snack bar to pick up provisions for a picnic lunch.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Return to your car, drive over Sentinel Bridge, turn left, and continue on Southside Drive toward Curry Village. Hardy hikers may want to go straight to the day-use lot, walk to the end of the shuttle-bus road, and climb the moderately steep trail to the footbridge overlooking 317-foot Vernal Fall (1½ mi round-trip; allow 1½ hours). Looping back toward Yosemite Village, follow signs to the Ahwahnee Hotel.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Back on the main road heading west, drive to Yosemite Falls, the highest waterfall in North America. If you have time at the end of the day, drive up to Glacier Point for a sunset view of the Valley and the surrounding peaks.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Yosemite in Three Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you have three days, start at the Valley Visitor Center. Head west for a short hike to Yosemite Falls. Afterward, continue driving west for a valley view of giant, granite El Capitan. Continue west on Northside Drive, and follow signs for Route 41 (Wawona Road); head south. At the Chinquapin junction, make a left turn onto Glacier Point Road (summer only). From Glacier Point, you\'ll get a phenomenal bird\'s-eye view of the entire Valley, including Half Dome, Vernal Fall, and Nevada Fall. If you want to avoid the busloads of tourists at Glacier Point, stop at Sentinel Dome instead.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On Day 2, head south on Route 41 and visit the Mariposa Grove of Big Tre es and the Pioneer Yosemite History Center. Stop at the historic Wawona Hotel and have lunch. Return to Yosemite Valley on Route 41, stopping at the Tunnel View pullout to take in the breathtaking panorama of the Valley, with the afternoon sun lighting up the peaks. Back in the Valley, stop at Bridalveil Falls on the right side of the road. Then head to the Ahwahnee Hotel.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the third day, have breakfast near the Valley Visitor Center in Yosemite Village, then see the Ansel Adams Gallery, the re-created Ahwahneechee Village, and the Yosemite Museum. Pick up light provisions before hiking to Vernal Fall or Nevada Fall. Picnic on the trail or in the Valley, then visit Tuolumne Meadows, 55 mi east of the Valley on Tioga Road (Route 120, summer only).</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Yosemite Essentials</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Accessibility</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Yosemite\'s facilities are continually being upgraded to make them more accessible. Many of the Valley floor trails—particularly at Lower Yosemite Falls, Bridalveil Falls, and Mirror Lake—are wheelchair accessible, though some assistance may be required. The Valley Visitor Center is fully accessible, as are the shuttle buses around the Valley. A sign-language interpreter is available for ranger programs if you call ahead. For complete details, pick up the park\'s accessibility brochure at any visitor center or entrance, read it at www.nps.gov/yose/access, or call the public information office at 209/372-0200. Visitors with respiratory difficulties should take note of the park\'s high elevations—the Valley floor is approximately 4,000 feet above sea level, but Tuolumne Meadows and parts of the high country hover around 10,000 feet.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Admission Fees</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The vehicle admission fee is $20 per car and is valid for seven days. Individuals arriving by bus, or on foot, bicycle, motorcycle, or horseback pay $10 for a seven-day pass.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Admission Hours</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The park is open daily, 24 hours a day. All entrances are open at all hours, except for Hetch Hetchy Entrance, open roughly dawn to dusk. Yosemite is in the Pacific time zone.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Emergencies</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In an emergency, call 911. You can also call the Yosemite Medical Clinic in Yosemite Village at 209/372-4637. The clinic provides 24-hour emergency care.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lost and Found</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To inquire about items lost or found in Yosemite\'s restaurants, hotels, lounges, shuttles, or tour buses, call Delaware North Corporation at 209/372-4357 or e-mail yoselost@dncinc.com. For items lost or found in other areas of the park, contact the National Park Service at 209/379-1001 or e-mail yose_web_manager@nps.gov.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Permits</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you plan to camp in the backcountry, you must have a wilderness permit. Availability of permits, which are free, depends upon trailhead quotas. It\'s best to make a reservation, especially if you will be visiting May through September. You can reserve two days to 24 weeks in advance by phone, mail, or e-mail; a $5 per person processing fee is charged if and when your reservations are confirmed. In your request, include your name, address, daytime phone, the number of people in your party, trip date, alternative dates, starting and ending trailheads, and a brief itinerary. Without a reservation, you may still get a free permit on a first-come, first-served basis at wilderness permit offices at Big Oak Flat, Hetch Hetchy, Tuolumne, Wawona, the Wilderness Center, and Yosemite Valley in summer; fall through spring, visit the Valley Visitor Center.</div><h3 class=\"WorldGuide\">Contacts</h3><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Wilderness Permits</b> (Box 545, Yosemite, 95389. tel. 209/372-0740. www.nps.gov/yose/wilderness/permits.htm).</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Public Telephones</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are public telephones at park entrance stations, visitor centers, all restaurants and lodging facilities in the park, gas stations, and in Yosemite Village.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Restrooms</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Public restrooms are at visitor centers; all restaurants and lodging facilities in the park; at the Village Store, the Vernal Falls footbridge, Yosemite Falls, Tuolumne Meadows, and Glacier Point; and at the Swinging Bridge, Cathedral Beach, Sentinel Beach, Church Bowl, and El Capitan picnic areas.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The water from the top descends a total of 2,425 feet, and when the falls run hard, you can hear them thunder all across the Valley. When they dry up, as often happens in late summer, the Valley seems naked without the wavering tower of spray. To view the falls up close, head to their base on the trail from Camp 4. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Panorama Gondola</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Even if you don\'t ski, ride the Panorama Gondola to see Mammoth Mountain, the aptly named dormant volcano that gives Mammoth Lakes its name. Gondolas serve skiers in winter and mountain bikers and sightseers in summer. The high-speed, eight-passenger gondolas whisk you from the chalet to the summit, where you can read about the area\'s volcanic history and take in top-of-the-world views. Standing high above the tree line atop this dormant volcano, you can look west 150 mi across the state to the Coastal Range; to the east are the highest peaks of Nevada and the Great Basin beyond. You won\'t find a better view of the Sierra High Country without climbing. Remember, though, that the air is thin at the 11,053-foot summit; carry water, and don\'t overexert yourself. The boarding area is at the Main Lodge. COST: $18 in summer.

But who was this much revered man of the cloth, and why is he depicted holding a huge sword in the statue that stands in front of the Wasserkirche?</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1484 Zwingli was born in the tiny village of Wildhaus in the canton of St. Gallen. He entered the priesthood, eventually rising to the head position at the Grossmünster in the city of Zürich. He had no problem declaring publicly where he differed with the teachings of the Catholic Church. His first quarrel, around 1512, was over the evils of the Swiss mercenary service propagated by the Pope. A few years later, around 1519, he joined the fight against the church\'s growing practice of exacting payment for the forgiveness of sins.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Taking a closer look at the New Testament, Zwingli came up with his own very simple theology: if it\'s not in the Bible, it doesn\'t apply. This focus on both the Old and New Testaments soon spread throughout the Christian world, affecting Protestant congregations all the way to the English colonies in America. While Martin Luther\'s form of protest was largely peaceful, Zwingli was not above getting into the fray. As people took up arms over their right to worship as they saw fit, Zwingli suited up and went to battle. He died in 1531, along with 500 of his compatriots, clutching that very big sword at the Battle of Kappel am Albis in the canton of Zürich.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Charlemagne is said to have founded the church after his horse stumbled over their burial site. On the side of the south tower an enormous stone Charlemagne sits enthroned; the original statue, carved in the late 15th century, is protected in the crypt. In keeping with what the 16th-century reformer Zwingli preached from the Grossmünster\'s pulpit, the interior is spare, even forbidding, with all luxurious ornamentation long since stripped away. The only artistic touches are modern: stained-glass windows by Augusto Giacometti, and ornate bronze doors in the north and south portals, dating from the late 1940s.

Train options are scarce, with just Abilene and El Paso stops along Amtrak\'s route.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">On Set in Brackettville</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most have never heard of a little burg called Brackettville, Texas, but movie producers and hallmark Western actors like John Wayne and Tommy Lee Jones clearly have. That\'s because they\'ve chosen a sprawling ranch near this 1,800-soul town to film more than 200 productions on the most extensive outdoor set in the country. Since 1959, films from The Good Old Boys (starring Jones and Frances McDormand) to Bad Girls (starring Drew Barrymore and Andie McDowell) have captured the beautifully maintained ersatz glory of the ranch and set.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Among a long list is John Wayne\'s 1960 flick The Alamo, which also featured Frankie Avalon and Laurence Harvey; and Barbarosa, a film about feuding families starring Willie Nelson and Gary Busey. Creators of the incredibly popular TV miniseries \"Lonesome Dove\" also chose the ranch to weave their tale of cowboys trying to drive their herd through the state despite various challenges.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The $12 million set was worked on by as many as 400 workers at once. Many of them roamed the huge ranch, collecting cow and horse manure to make the adobe-style dwellings in the traditional way. Apparently, the dirty work paid off; more than a million bricks were made, more than 200,000 square feet were lofted, and the film became an icon. These days, strollers don\'t find a single false front among the buildings on the monumental set. They find a John Wayne museum, a mariachi band and folklorico dancers, line dancing, and even cattle drives. Live entertainment is served up alongside cheeseburgers and barbecue in the Alamo Village Cantina, and a stagecoach carries riders on a careening ride through the streets.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Surrounding the Alamo set is almost 30 mi of working ranch, complete with longhorns, horses, and goats. The ranch is still used for filming. For about 11 bucks the public can tour the famous full-scale Alamo Village set or take in the periodic horse races and the gunslinger competitions, where contenders try for the fastest draw.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">—Jennifer Edwards</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Ferries and hydrofoils run on regular schedules during high season. The waters are calm and beckoning, and boating for pleasure frees you from the tension of coastal driving, giving a different perspective on the coast, so try to arrange to spend at least one day on the water. Bright red-and-blue fishing boats are for hire by the day or for a few hours at the major harbors of Sorrento, Positano, and Amalfi, and by almost any beach wherever you see fishermen.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Boats can take you around the Sorrento area, to the Emerald Grotto, to Capri and offshore islets, to major towns, and otherwise inaccessible cove beaches. They will drop you off and pick you up, or stay with you, depending on your budget. Look for established sites on major beaches and come a day or so ahead to reserve and bargain, especially if you\'re with a group.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pricing could be around EUR 20 an hour, more or less, depending on the market, the season, and your talent at haggling. If in doubt, ask for recommendations about local boatmen at your hotel or at the town tourist board. And don\'t expect fishermen to speak much English; you\'ll have to learn to speak with your hands, as many Italians do.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Experiencing the Amalfi Coast: Beachgoing</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Except for the showpieces at Positano, Atrani, Maiori, and Minori, the area\'s beaches are generally disappointing, as they usually consist of small patches of coarse gray sand, or just a few rocks below the precipices. In these parts, it\'s the water that compels: infinite shades of aquamarine, lapis, and amethyst—shimmering in sunshine, glowing silver in moonlight, and becoming transparent in coves.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The longest and widest beaches on the Amalfi Coast are in Maiori and Minori. As space is at a premium, few organized beachside activities are available, the best being at Positano, where you should opt for beautiful Fornillo, the more secluded (but very popular) beach to the west of Spiaggia Grande.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For exercise, folks descend (and later ascend) the scalinatelle to rocky coves, where the adults dip and sunbathe and the children play hide-and-seek. The terrain below sea level is as craggy and steep as the land above—a boon for good swimmers—but as most of the beaches shelve quite steeply, caution needs to be taken, especially with kids.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The View of Infinity at Villa Cimbrone</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A panorama <i>in excelsis,</i> the view from the Villa Cimbrone\'s Belvedere of Infinity is nothing less than an invitation into the Beyond: on many bright-blue days, you can\'t tell where the sea ends and the sky begins. Little wonder some feel this is the very spot where Satan brought Christ to tempt him with the beauties of the world.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The parapet is adorned with eight <i>figura di fantasia</i> depicting Renaissance courtesans and condottieri, fashioned by an 18th-century Neapolitan sculptor. With faces narrowed in contemplation, they stare at you with their backs to That View. You, naturally, instead stare out at infinity—after all, this is the one place the famed poet Gabriele d\'Annunzio said \"you can be kissed by infinity, as it clasps you with both arms.\"</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The entire cove is romantically lined with <i>stabilimenti</i>—elegant bathing lidos where the striped cabanas are often air-conditioned and the bodies can be Modigliani-sleek. The most famous of these lidos (there\'s a fee to use the facilities), found closest to I Faraglioni, is <b>La Canzone del Mare,</b> once presided over by the noted British music-hall singer Gracie Fields and for decades favored by the smart set, including Noël Coward and Emilio Pucci (who set up his first boutique here). La Canzone del Mare\'s seaside restaurant offers a dreamy view of I Faraglioni and a luncheon here, although pricey, can serve as an iconic Capri moment. Jutting out into the bay at the center of the marina is the <b>Scoglio delle Sirene,</b> or Sirens\' Rock—a small natural promontory—which the ancients believed to be the haunt of the Sirens, the mythical temptresses whose song seduced Odysseus in Homer\'s <i>Odyssey.</i> This rock separates the two small beaches: Pennaulo, to the east, and Marina di Mulo, site of the original Roman harbor, to the west. The small church, <b>Chiesa di Sant\'Andrea</b>, was built in 1900 to give the local fishermen a place of worship. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Certosa di San Giacomo</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nestled between the Castiglione and Tuoro hills, this grand, palatial complex was for centuries a Carthusian monastery dedicated to St. James. It was founded between 1371 and 1374, when Queen Giovanna I of Naples gave Count Giacomo Arcucci, her secretary, the land and the means to create it. The count himself then became devoutly religious and retired here until his death. After the monastery was sacked by the pirates Dragut and Barbarossa in the 16th century, it was heavily restored and rebuilt—thanks in part to heavy taxes exacted from the populace. The friars within were detested by many Capresi for refusing to open the gates to minister to the people when plague broke out.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The complex was reopened to the public in 2008 after major renovations lasting four years. You enter via a grandly imposing entryway, which leads to the <b>Biblioteca Comunale Popolare Luigi Bladier</b> (public library—Capri\'s only free Internet point) and the spacious church of <b>San Giacomo</b> (built in 1690). After admiring the church\'s Baroque frescoes, follow the signpost down toward the <i>Parco,</i> which leads down an avenue flanked by pittosporum and magnolia toward the monastery gardens and some welcome benches. Take heed of the signs reminding you to watch your step, as the ground is uneven in places. Beyond a covered road lies the <b>Chiostro Grande</b> (Large Cloister)—originally the site of the monks\' cells and now the home of a high school. Nearby is the much prettier 15th-century <b>Chiostro Piccolo</b> (Small Cloister), often the venue for summertime open-air concerts. The showstopper here is the <b>Museo Diefenbach,</b> comprising a collection of large canvases by the German painter K. W. Diefenbach, who visited Capri in 1900 and stayed until his death in 1913. Although his protracted stay may have cured Diefenbach of his chronic depression, his tormented soul emerges clearly in his powerful paintings, filled with apocalyptic storms and saintly apparitions. For years, Diefenbach rivaled the Blue Grotto for sheer picturesqueness—he was given to greeting visitors replete with flowing white beard, monk\'s cowl, and primitive sandals. From La Piazzetta take Via Vittorio Emanuele and then Via F. Serena to reach this beautiful monastic complex, one of the highlights of historic Capri. www.capricertosa.com. COST: Free. OPEN: Tues.-Sun. 9-2, park 9-1 hr before sunset. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cappuccini Convento</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Currently closed and undergoing restoration work by new owners (rumor is that it will reopen in 2010), this fabled medieval monastery enjoys a magnificent hilltop perch and was a noted stop for Grand Tour-era travelers. Long famous for its gardens, its ½-km-long (¼-mi-long) terrace over Amalfi\'s harbor, and its Arab-Sicilian cloister, the monastery was founded by Cistercian monks in the 13th century as the Convento di S. Pietro della Canonica. Then abandoned, the complex was taken over by the Capuchins in 1583, only to be transformed into a hotel in the mid-19th century when the king of Naples suppressed the religious orders. Immortalized in postcards and paintings, the view of Amalfi\'s waterfront from the hotel terrace became one of the first travel icons of the 19th century. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow composed a poem to celebrate its beauty and Richard Wagner forsook his guest room to camp out under the stars. In the recent past, visitors could stroll through the monastery and let the centuries unwind: the 13th-century cloister has the intertwined Arabic columns of the Amalfi cathedral\'s great Paradise Cloister, the little church is a Rococo confection, and the spirit-warm hallways and salons were barely changed from the 19th century. Let us hope they survive the ongoing renovation to bring them all into the 21st century. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Santa Maria a Cetrella</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Scenically perched on the slopes of Monte Solaro, this small sanctuary in late-Gothic style—with its older parts dating to the late 14th century—offers a truly picturesque frame for a panorama that takes in much of the island. It also marks the top of the second access route (Il Passetiello) used in ancient times, which linked Capri Town with Anacapri. Steep, slippery, and in spots still dangerous, this is the pathway that the Carthusian monks of San Giacomo would have used to reach their properties in the upper part of the island. Congregants were mainly fisherfolk whose boats were moored in the Marina Piccola directly below; they also used this cliff-top aerie as a lookout against Saracen pirates. The church was substantially rebuilt by Franciscan monks in the early 17th century, when a sacristy was added. To reach Santa Maria, you can climb a path leading off Viale Axel Munthe (an hour-long walk); an alternative is to descend a path leading from the Monte Solaro chairlift. The church has erratic opening times; ask at the chairlift for further information. Mass is celebrated at dawn every Sunday in September, but the site remains unforgettable year-round. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Seen from Villandry\'s cliff-side walkway, the garden terraces look like flowered chessboards blown up to the nth power—a breathtaking sight.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Beyond the water garden and an ornamental garden depicting symbols of chivalric love is the famous <i>potager,</i> or vegetable garden, which stretches on for bed after bed—the pumpkins here are <i>les pièces de résistance.</i> Flower lovers will rejoice in the main <i>jardin à la française</i> (French-style garden): framed by a canal, it\'s a vast carpet of rare and colorful blooms planted <i>en broderie</i> (\"like embroidery\"), set into patterns by box hedges and paths. The aromatic and medicinal garden, its plots neatly labeled in three languages, is especially appealing. Below an avenue of 1,500 precisely pruned lime trees lies an ornamental lake that is home to two swans: not a ripple is out of place. The château interior was restored in the mid-19th century; of particular note are the painted and gilt Moorish ceiling from Toledo and the collection of Spanish pictures. Note that the quietest time to visit is usually during the two-hour French lunch break, while the most photogenic is during the <b>Nuits des Mille Feux</b> (Nights of a Thousand Lights, usually held in early July), when paths and pergolas are illuminated with myriad lanterns and a dance troupe offers a tableau vivant. There is a gardening weekend held in early September and a music festival in October. There is no train station at Villandry, but the Line V bus between Tours and Azay-le-Rideau stops there every Wednesday and Saturday, daily in July and August; you can also train to nearby Savonnières and taxi the rest of the 4-km (2½-mi) distance. www.chateauvillandry.com.

The gallery was used as an escape point for French Resistance fighters during World War II, since all other crossings had been bombed. Set in the village of Chenonceaux (spelled with an <i>x</i>) on the River Cher, this was the fabled retreat for the <i>dames de Chenonceau,</i> Diane de Poitiers, Catherine de\' Medici, and Mary Queen of Scots. Happily spending at least half a day wandering through the château and grounds, you can see that this monument has an undeniable feminine touch. During the peak summer season the only drawback is the château\'s popularity: if you want to avoid a roomful of schoolchildren, take a stroll on the grounds and come back to the house at lunchtime.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">More pleasure palace than fortress, the château was built in 1520 by Thomas Bohier, a wealthy tax collector, for his wife, Catherine Briçonnet. When he went bankrupt, it passed to François I. Later, Henri II gave it to his mistress, Diane de Poitiers. After his death, Henri\'s not-so-understanding widow, Catherine de\' Medici, expelled Diane to nearby Chaumont and took back the château. Before this time, Diane\'s five-arched bridge over the River Cher was simply meant as a grand ceremonial entryway leading to a gigantic château, a building never constructed. It was to Catherine, and her architect, Philibert de l\'Orme, that historians owe the audacious plan to transform the bridge itself into the most unusual château in France. Two stories were constructed over the river, including an enormous gallery that runs from one end of the château to the other. This design might seem the height of originality but, in fact, was inspired by Florence\'s covered Ponte Vecchio bridge, commissioned by a Medici queen homesick for her native town.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">July and August are the peak months at Chenonceau: Only then can you escape the madding crowds by exiting at the far end of the gallery to walk along the opposite bank (weekends only), rent a rowboat to spend an hour just drifting in the river (where Diane used to enjoy her morning dips), and enjoy the <b>Promenade Nocturne,</b> an evocative son et lumière performed in the illuminated château gardens.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Before you go inside, pick up an English-language leaflet at the gate. Then walk around to the right of the main building to see the harmonious, delicate architecture beyond the formal garden—the southern part belonged to Diane de Poitiers, the northern was Catherine\'s—with the river gliding under the arches (providing superb \"air-conditioning\" to the rooms above). Inside the château are splendid ceilings, colossal fireplaces, scattered furnishings, and paintings by Rubens, del Sarto, and Correggio. The curatorial staff have delightfully dispensed with velvet ropes and adorned some of the rooms with bouquets designed in 17th-century style. As you tour the salons, be sure to pay your respects to former owner Madame Dupin, tellingly captured in Nattier\'s charming portrait: Thanks to the affection she inspired among her proletarian neighbors, the château and its treasures survived the Revolution intact (her grave is enshrined near the northern embankment). The château\'s history is illustrated with wax figures in the <b>Musée des Cires</b> (Waxwork Museum) in one of the château\'s outbuildings. A cafeteria, tearoom, and the ambitious Orangerie restaurant handle the crowds\' varied appetites. www.chenonceau.com.

Between 1115 and the French Revolution in 1789, a succession of 39 abbesses—among them a granddaughter of William the Conqueror—directed operations. The great 12th-century <b>Église Abbatiale</b> (Abbey Church) contains the tombs of Henry II of England, his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, and their son, Richard Cœur de Lion (the Lion-Hearted). Though their bones were scattered during the Revolution, their effigies still lie <i>en couchant</i> in the middle of the echoey nave. Napoléon turned the abbey church into a prison, and so it remained until 1963, when historical restoration work—still under way—began. The <b>Salle Capitulaire</b> (Chapter House), adjacent to the church, with its collection of 16th-century religious wall paintings (prominent abbesses served as models), is unmistakably Renaissance; the paving stones bear the salamander emblem of François I. Next to the long refectory is the famously octagonal <b>Cuisine</b> (Kitchen), topped by 20 scaly stone chimneys led by the <b>Tour d\'Evrault.</b>www.abbaye-fontevraud.com. COST: EUR 8.40.

Literature describes this château, overlooking the banks of the River Indre, as the original <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> castle; Charles Perrault—author of this beloved 17th-century tale—spent time here as a guest of the Count of Saumur, and legend has it that Ussé inspired him to write the famous story. Though parts of the castle are from the 1400s, most of it was completed two centuries later. By the 17th century, the region was so secure that one fortified wing of the castle was demolished to allow for grand vistas over the valley and the castle gardens, newly designed in the style Le Nôtre had made so fashionable at Versailles.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Only Disney could have outdone this white-tufa marvel: the château is a flamboyant mix of Gothic and Renaissance styles—romantic and built for fun, not for fighting. Its history supports this playful image: it endured no bloodbaths—no political conquests or conflicts—while a tablet in the chapel indicates that even the French Revolution passed it by. Inside, a tour leads you through several sumptuous period salons, a 19th-century French fashion exhibit, and the Salle de Roi bedchamber built for a visit by King Louis XV (the red-silk, canopied four-poster bed is the stuff of dreams). At the end of the house tour, you can go up the fun spiral staircases to the <i>chemin de ronde</i> of the lofty towers; there are pleasant views of the Indre River from the battlements, and you can also find rooms filled with waxwork effigies detailing the fable of Sleeping Beauty herself. Kids will love this.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Before you leave, visit the exquisite Gothic-becomes-Renaissance chapel in the garden, built for Charles d\'Espinay and his wife in 1523-35. Note the door decorated with pleasingly sinister skull-and-crossbones carvings. Just a few steps from the chapel are two towering cedars of Lebanon—a gift from the genius-poet of Romanticism, Viscount René de Chateaubriand, to the lady of the house, the Duchess of Duras. When her famous amour died in 1848, she stopped all the clocks in the house—à la Sleeping Beauty—\"so as never to hear struck the hours you will not come again.\" The castle then was inherited by her relations, the Comte and Comtesse de la Rochejaquelin, one of the most dashing couples of the 19th century. Today, Ussé belongs to their descendant, the Duc de Blacas, who is as soigné as his castle. If you do meet him, proffer thanks, as every night his family floodlights the entire château, a vision that is one of the Loire Valley\'s dreamiest sights. Long regarded as a symbol of <i>la vieille France,</i> Ussé can\'t be topped for fairy-tale splendor, so make this a must-do. www.chateaudusse.fr. COST: EUR 13. OPEN: Mid-Feb.-mid-Nov., daily 10-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hôtel Groslot</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Just across the square from the cathedral is the Hôtel Groslot, a Renaissance-era extravaganza (1549-55) bristling with caryatids, strap work, and Flemish columns. Inside are regal salons redolent of the city\'s history (this used to be the Town Hall), all done in the most sumptuous 19th-century Gothic Troubadour style and perhaps haunted by King François II (who died here in 1560 by the side of his bride, Mary Queen of Scots).

Each is often often wrapped in a wall and crowned with the two strongest assurances of protection, sacred and secular: a steeple and a watchtower. Nowadays many of the hill towns are nearly ghost towns, though more and more are tapping into the tourist boom. Those closest to the coast and to urban centers—in the Luberon and in Nice\'s backcountry, in particular—have become souvenir malls choked with galleries of dubious quality. Yet as the tourist packs rove on in search of authenticity, the other hill towns develop their commerce and find new life. In these, you can still wander aimlessly through the maze of tunnel-like <i>ruelles</i> (alleys) and feel the isolation—often idyllic, sometimes harsh—of these eagle\'s-nest enclaves, high above the world.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Paul Cézanne, Superstar</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Matisse called him \"the father of us all.\" He helped catapult Picasso into Cubism. And nearly every artist working today owes a huge debt to the man who finally kicked over the traces of traditional art—Paul Cézanne (1839-1906), Aix-en-Provence\'s most famous native son. His images of Mont Ste-Victoire and his timeless still-lifes are the founding icons of 20th-century painting. With them, he not only invented a new pictorial language but immortalized his Provençal homeland.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Great Cézannes may hang in museums (or appear for sale—one brought $50,000,000 in 2003) but you can\'t really understand the artist without experiencing his Provence firsthand. As it turns out, he is everywhere: Aix even has a Cézanne trail (marked with \"C\" copper studs) to mark sites within town.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The two most moving locales, however, are set just outside the city. Cézanne\'s father bought the Jas de Bouffon estate in 1859 to celebrate his rise from hatmaker to banker. The budding artist lived here until 1899. Today, its salons are empty but the grounds are full of his spirit, especially the Allée de Marronniers out front. The Jas is a mile south of town and can only be visited on tour by booking a minibus seat through the town\'s central tourist office www.aixenprovencetourism.com, EUR 5.50, Nov.-Feb., Wed., Sat., 10 AM; Oct.Apr., Tues., Thurs., Sat., 10:305:30; JuneSept., daily 10:305:30). One mile north of Aix\'s center is \"Les Lauves,\" the studio the artist built in 1901, set in a magically overgrown olive grove. The high point here lies a mile along the Chemin de la Marguerite: the belvedere spot from which the artist painted his last views of Mont Ste-Victoire (indeed, he died shortly after being caught in a storm here).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Mona Lisa of modern art, Cézanne painted self-portraits that were inscrutable and hiding many secrets. He was illegitimate; he wound up having an 17-year-long affair with Hortense Piquet; and he hid his own illegitimate son from his father to inherit the family fortune. Indeed, this \"painter of peasants\" never worked a day in his life. Unless, that is, you consider revolutionizing the art of painting \"work.\" When he abandoned Aix\'s art academy for the dramatic landscapes of the surrounding hills, he became smitten with the stark, high-noon light of Provence, rejecting the sugar-almond hues of Impressionism. Instead of mixing colors to create shadows like Monet, he simply used black. Instead of using translucent haze to create an effect of distance, he focused on ruler-straight Provençal streets (laid out by ancient Romans) to hurtle the eye from foreground to background.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the end, Cézanne wanted to impose himself on the landscape, not vice versa. So why not do the same? With brochures from the Aix tourist office, head out into Cézanne Country—the roads leading to Le Tholonet and Mont Ste-Victoire. Walk these shady trails and you\'ll learn just how Cézanne became the trailblazer of modern art.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Van Gogh in Arles & St-Rémy</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It was the light that drew Vincent van Gogh to Arles. For a man raised under the iron-gray skies of the Netherlands and the gaslight pall of Paris, Provence\'s clean, clear sun was a revelation. In his last years he turned his frenzied efforts to capture the resonance of \"… golden tones of every hue: green gold, yellow gold, pink gold, bronze or copper colored gold, and even from the yellow of lemons to the matte, lusterless yellow of threshed grain.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Arles, however, was not drawn to Van Gogh. Though it makes every effort today to make up for its misjudgment, Arles treated the artist very badly during the time he passed here near the end of his life—a time when his creativity, productivity, and madness all reached a climax. It was 1888 when he settled in to work in Arles with an intensity and tempestuousness that first drew, then drove away his companion Paul Gauguin, with whom he had dreamed of founding an artists\' colony.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Frenziedly productive—he applied a pigment-loaded palette knife to some 200 canvases in that year alone—he nonetheless lived within intense isolation, counting his sous, and writing his visions in lengthy letters to his long-suffering, infinitely patient brother Theo. Often heavy-drinking, occasionally whoring, Vincent alienated his neighbors, goading them to action. In 1889 the people of Arles circulated a petition to have him evicted, a shock that left him more and more at a loss to cope with life and led to his eventual self-commitment to an asylum in nearby St-Rémy. The houses he lived in are no longer standing, though many of his subjects remain as he saw them. The paintings he daubed and splashed with such passion have been auctioned elsewhere.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Thus you have to go to Amsterdam or Moscow to view Van Gogh\'s work. But with a little imagination, you can glean something of Van Gogh\'s Arles from a tour of the modern town. In fact, the city has provided helpful markers and a numbered itinerary to guide you between landmarks. You can stand on the Place Lamartine, where his famous Maison Jaune stood until it was destroyed by World War II bombs. <i>Starry Night</i> may have been painted from the Quai du Rhône just off Place Lamartine, though another was completed at St-Rémy.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Café La Nuit on Place Forum is an exact match for the terrace platform, scattered with tables and bathed in gaslight under the stars, from the painting <i>Terrace de café le Soir</i>; Gauguin and Van Gogh used to drink here. (Current owners have determinedly maintained the Fauve color scheme to keep the atmosphere.) Both the Arènes and Les Alyscamps were featured in paintings, and the hospital where he broke down and cut off his ear is now a kind of shrine, its garden reconstructed exactly as it figured in <i>Le Jardin de l\'Hôtel-Dieu.</i> The drawbridge in <i>Le pont de Langlois aux Lavandières</i> has been reconstructed outside of town, at Port-de-Bouc, 3 km (2 mi) south on D35.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">About 25 km (15½ mi) away is St-Rémy-de-Provence, where Van Gogh retreated to the asylum St-Paul-de-Mausolée. Here he spent hours in silence, painting the cloisters. On his ventures into town, he painted the dappled lime trees at the intersection of Boulevard Mirabeau and Boulevard Gambetta. And en route between the towns, you\'ll see the orchards whose spring blooms ignited his joyous explosions of yellow, green, and pink.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Though never officially inhabited, it was expanded and heightened in the 18th century to showcase the classical orders—Ionic, Doric, and Corinthian—in its parade of neo-Grecian columns. Inside its cool, broad chambers you\'ll find a charming collection of Provençal furniture and artwork. Note the curious two giant Atlantes that hold up the interior balcony. COST: EUR 2.

In the upstairs work space, the artist created some of his finest paintings, including <i>Les Grandes Baigneuses</i> (<i>The Large Bathers).</i> The latter was so large, in fact, that the artist had a special slot built into the studio wall, as the canvas was too broad to carry down the stairs. But what is most striking is the collection of simple objects that once featured prominently in the still lifes he created: the tin milk can, the ginger jar, the flowered crockery, bottles and glasses from <i>La Nature Morte aux Oignons</i> (<i>Still Life with Onions</i>), and a tin coffee pot from <i>La Femme à la Cafétière</i> (<i>The Woman with the Coffee Pot</i>). Also here are Cézanne\'s redingote and bowler hat, hanging from pegs just as he left them; brushes, paint tubes, and the engravings with which he surrounded himself—works by Courbet, Delacroix, and Poussin. The atelier is behind an obscure garden gate on the left as you climb the Avenue Paul-Cézanne. Be sure not to miss the after-dark \"Nuit des Toiles\" shows that take place in July and August, or the literary/gastronomic evenings also held in July. www.atelier-cezanne.com. COST: EUR 5.50.

Once densely decorated in tapestries, frescoes, and sumptuous fabrics, it hosted feasts of Lucullan extravagance and witnessed intrigues of Gothic proportion. The pope ruled within as half god, half prince, eating alone at an elevated table in the crowded dining hall, sleeping in a lavishly decorated bedroom distinctly devoid of sacred reference. His chamberlain\'s bedroom had eight hiding holes, complete with trapdoors concealed under carpets; who knows to what use they were put?</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">But don\'t expect to see eye-boggling luxury today. Resentful revolutionaries hacked away most traces of excess in the 1780s, and, ironically, what remains has a monastic purity. Most of all you may be struck by the scale; either one of its two wings dwarfs the cathedral beside it, and between them they cover almost 50,000 feet of surface. The grand-scale interiors are evocative as well, with a massive wooden barrel vault arching over the dining hall like a boat belly and a kitchen with fireplaces big enough to house a family. The <b>Grande Audience</b> (Grand Audience Hall) and the <b>Grande Chapelle</b> are as vast as cathedrals.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From your first exterior view of them, note the difference between the two wings of the palace. The north end, toward the cathedral, is the Palais Vieux (Old Palace), a severe Cistercian bastion built by the sober Pope Benedict XII between 1335 and 1342; the south end was built over the next ten years with slightly airier fantasy by Pope Clement VI, who prized his creature comforts.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">An enthusiastic patron of the arts, Clement VI brought in a team of artists from Italy to decorate his digs. It was led by no less than Simone Martini himself, imported from Siena and Assisi (where he had worked with Giotto). On his death, Mattheo Giovanetti took the lead, and the frescoes that covered every surface must have been one of the wonders of the world. Some of the finest traces remain in Clement\'s study, called the <b>Chambre du Cerf</b> (Stag\'s Room), where the walls still retain the lovely frescoes he commissioned in 1343. Unlike the Raphael masterpieces that decorate the Vatican chambers in Rome, which use lofty classical themes and powerful Christian images, these paintings depict simple hunting scenes: a stag hunt, bird snaring, and fishing. They\'re graceful, almost naive in style, and intimate in scale, but the attempts at perspective in the deep window frames remind you that this was an advanced center of culture and learning in the 14th century, and perspective was then downright avant-garde, fresh from the sketchbooks of Giotto. Among many fragments, one other example of Giovanetti\'s work can be viewed in its entirety in <b>Chapelle St-Jean</b> (St. John Chapel), a masterpiece of composition in which the interplay of hands and the implied lines of gazes create a silent dialogue.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though you may be anxious to see the more famous spaces, take time on entering to read the displays about the evolution of this UNESCO splendor and to study the scale model of the palace in its medieval context. Only then can you take in its enormity, looming like Olympus over the tiny half-timber houses that crowded the Place du Palais—a palace worthy of a royal dynasty and a temple to holy hubris.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For wine lovers, there\'s a wine cellar devoted to Côtes du Rhônes at the <b>Bouteillerie</b> (tel. 04-90-27-50-85) of the Popes\' Palace where you can sample and buy regional wines; the selection changes every year and the shop is open daily.

The primary truffle areas are around the tiny town of Norcia, which holds a truffle festival every February, and near Spoleto, where signs warn against unlicensed truffle hunting at the base of the Ponte delle Torri.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although grown locally, the rare delicacy can cost a small fortune, up to $200 for a quarter pound—fortunately, a little goes a long way. At such a price there\'s great competition among the nearly 10,000 registered truffle hunters in the province, who use specially trained dogs to sniff them out among the roots of several types of trees, including oak and ilex. Despite a few incidents involving inferior tubers imported from China, you can be reasonably assured that the truffle shaved onto your pasta has been unearthed locally. Don\'t pass up the opportunity to try this delectable treat. The intense aroma of a dish perfumed with truffles is unmistakable and the flavor memorable.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hiking the Umbrian Hills</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Magnificent scenery makes the heart of Italy excellent walking, hiking, and mountaineering country. In Umbria, the area around Spoleto is particularly good; several pleasant, easy, and well-signed trails begin at the far end of the Ponte alle Torri bridge over Monteluco. From Cannara an easy half-hour walk leads to the fields of Pian d\'Arca, the site of Saint Francis\'s sermon to the birds. For slightly more-arduous walks, you can follow the saint\'s path, uphill from Assisi to the Eremo delle Carceri, and then continue along the trails that crisscross Monte Subasio. At 4,250 feet, the Subasio\'s treeless summit affords views of Assisi, Perugia, far-off Gubbio, and the distant mountain ranges of Abruzzo.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For even more-challenging hiking, the northern reaches of the Valnerina are exceptional; the mountains around Norcia should not to be missed. Throughout Umbria and the Marches, you\'ll find that most recognized walking and hiking trails are marked with the distinctive red-and-white blazes of the Club Alpino Italiano. Tourist offices are a good source for walking and climbing itineraries to suit all ages and levels of ability, while bookstores, <i>tabacchi</i> (tobacconists), and <i>edicole</i> (newsstands) often have maps and hiking guides that detail the best routes in their area. Depending on the length and location of your walk, it can be important that you have comfortable walking shoes or boots, appropriate attire, and plenty of water to drink.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

In addition to paintings, the gallery has frescoes, sculptures, and some superb examples of crucifixes from the 13th and 14th centuries. Some rooms are dedicated to Perugia itself, showing how the medieval city evolved. www.gallerianazionaleumbria.it. COST: EUR 6.50. OPEN: Tues.-Sun. 8:30-7:30; last admission ½ hr before closing. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Duomo</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Orvieto\'s Duomo is, quite simply, stunning. The church was built to commemorate the Miracle at Bolsena. In 1263, a young priest who questioned the miracle of transubstantiation (in which the Communion bread and wine become the flesh and blood of Christ) was saying mass at nearby Lago di Bolsena. His doubts were put to rest, however, when a wafer he had just blessed suddenly started to drip blood, staining the linen covering the altar. The cloth and the host were taken to the pope, who proclaimed a miracle and a year later provided for a new religious holiday—the Feast of Corpus Domini. Thirty years later, construction began on a <i>duomo</i> to celebrate the miracle and house the stained altar cloth.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It is thought that Arnolfo di Cambio (circa 1245-1302), the famous builder of the Duomo in Florence, was given the initial commission for the Duomo, but the project was soon taken over by Lorenzo Maitani (circa 1275-1330), who consolidated the structure and designed the monumental facade. Maitani also made the bas-relief panels between the doorways, which graphically tell the story of the Creation (on the left) and the Last Judgment (on the right). The lower registers, now protected by Plexiglas, succeed in conveying the horrors of hell as few other works of art manage to do, an effect made all the more powerful by the worn gray marble. Above, gold mosaics are framed by finely detailed Gothic decoration.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Inside, the cathedral is rather vast and empty; the major works are in the transepts. To the left is the <b>Cappella del Corporale,</b> where the square linen cloth (corporale) is kept in a golden reliquary that\'s modeled on the cathedral and inlaid with enamel scenes of the miracle. The cloth is removed for public viewing on Easter and on Corpus Domini (the ninth Sunday after Easter). In the right transept is the <b>Cappella di San Brizio,</b> or Cappella Nuova. In this chapel is one of Italy\'s greatest fresco cycles, notable for its influence on Michelangelo\'s <i>Last Judgment,</i> as well as for the extraordinary beauty of the figuration. In these works, the damned fall to hell, demons breathe fire and blood, and Christians are martyred. Some scenes are heavily influenced by the imagery in Dante\'s (1265-1321) <i>The</i><i>Divine Comedy.</i>COST: Church free, Cappella Nuova EUR 5. OPEN: Nov.-Feb., daily 8-12:45 and 2:30-5:15; Mar. and Oct., daily 8-12:45 and 2:30-6:15; Apr.-Sept., daily 8-12:45 and 2:30-7:15. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Basilica di San Francesco</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The basilica is not one church but two, the Gothic upper part built a scant half century after the Romanesque lower one. Work on this two-tiered monolith was begun a few years after the death of St. Francis. His coffin, unearthed from its secret hiding place after a 52-day search in 1818, is on display in the crypt below the Lower Basilica. Both churches are magnificently decorated artistic treasure-houses, covered floor to ceiling with some of Europe\'s finest frescoes: the Lower Basilica is dim and full of candlelight shadows, while the Upper Basilica is bright and airy.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The first chapel to the left of the nave in the <b>Lower Church</b> was decorated by the Sienese master Simone Martini (1284-1344). Dating from 1322-26, the frescoes show the life of St. Martin—the sharing of his cloak with the poor man, the saint\'s knighthood, and his death. There is some dispute about the paintings in the third chapel on the right, which depict the life of Mary Magdalen. Experts have argued for years, with many attributing them to Giotto (1266-1337). There is a similar dispute about the works above the high altar, depicting the marriage of St. Francis to Poverty, Chastity, and Obedience—some say they are by Giotto; others claim them for an anonymous pupil. In the right transept are frescoes by Cimabue (circa 1240-1302), including a Madonna and saints, one of them St. Francis himself. In the left transept are some of the best-known works of the Sienese painter Pietro Lorenzetti (circa 1280-1348). They depict the <i>Madonna with Sts. John and Francis,</i> the <i>Crucifixion,</i> and the <i>Descent from the Cross.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\'s quite a contrast to climb the steps next to the altar and emerge into the bright sunlight and airy grace of the double-arched Renaissance <b>Chiostro dei Morti</b> (Cloister of the Dead). A door to the right leads to the <b>Tesoro</b> (Treasury) of the church and contains relics of St. Francis and other holy objects associated with the order.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the <b>Upper Church</b> the frescoes show that Giotto, only in his twenties when he painted them, was a pivotal artist in the development of Western painting, breaking away from the stiff, unnatural styles of earlier generations and moving toward realism and three-dimensionality. The paintings are meant to be viewed from left to right, starting in the transept. The most beloved of the scenes is probably <i>St. Francis Preaching to the Birds,</i> a touching painting that seems to sum up the saint\'s gentle spirit. In the scene of the dream of Innocent III (circa 1160-1216), the pope dreams of a humble monk who will steady the church; in the panel next to the sleeping pope, you see a strong Francis supporting a church that seems to be on the verge of tumbling down—a scene that resonates with irony today. The dress code here is strictly enforced—no bare shoulders or bare knees. OPEN: Lower Church Easter-Oct., Mon.-Sat. 6:30AM-6:45PM, Sun. 6:30AM-7:15PM; Nov.-Easter, daily 6:30-6.

Wood saw Bath as a city destined for almost mythic greatness along the lines of Winchester and Glastonbury. Arriving in Bath in 1727, he sought an architectural style that would do justice to his concept, and found it in the Palladian style, made popular in Britain by Inigo Jones.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Wood created a harmonious city, building graceful terraces (row houses), crescents (curving rows of houses), and villas of the same golden local limestone used by the Romans. Influenced by nearby ancient stone circles as well as round Roman temples, Wood broke from convention in his design for Bath\'s Circus, a circle of houses broken only three times for intersecting streets.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After the death of Wood the Elder, John Wood the Younger (1728-82) carried out his father\'s plans for the Royal Crescent, an obtuse crescent of 30 interconnected houses. Today you can stop in at No. 1 Royal Crescent for a look at one of these homes—it\'s like eavesdropping on the 18th century. He also built the Assembly Rooms, now open to the public.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Arts and Crafts in the Cotswolds</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Arts and Crafts movement flourished throughout Britain in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but the Cotswolds are most closely associated with it. The godfather of the movement was designer William Morris (1834-96), whose home for the last 25 years of his life, Kelmscott Manor in Gloucestershire, became the headquarters of the school. A lecture by Morris,\"The Beauty of Life,\" delivered in Birmingham in 1880, included the injunction that became the guiding principle of the movement: \"Have nothing in your houses which you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Driven by the belief that the spirit of medieval arts and crafts was being degraded and destroyed by the mass production and aggressive capitalism of the Victorian era, and aided by a dedicated core of artisans, Morris revolutionized the art of house design and decoration. His work with textiles was particularly influential.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many of Morris\'s followers were influenced by the Cotswold countryside, such as the designer and architect Charles Robert Ashbee, who transferred his Guild of Handicrafts from London to Chipping Campden in 1902. The village holds a small museum dedicated to local craftwork, including a permanent exhibition of pieces by the original group and those who followed in their wake. Their work can also be seen at Cheltenham\'s Art Gallery and Museum, and, in its original context, at Rodmarton Manor outside Tetbury—which Ashbee declared the finest application of the movement\'s ideals—and at Owlpen Manor. (Farther afield, Blackwell in the Lake District is a notable Arts and Crafts house.) To see the Arts and Crafts ethic applied to horticulture, visit Hidcote Manor Garden, near Chipping Campden.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

With the departure of the Romans, the baths fell into disuse and were partially covered. When bathing again became fashionable, the site was reopened; the magnificent Georgian building now standing was erected at the end of the 18th century. During the 19th century almost the entire Roman bath complex was rediscovered and excavated, and the museum displays relics of the temple once dedicated to Sulis Minerva. Exhibits include a memorable mustachioed, Celtic-influenced Gorgon\'s head, fragments of colorful curses invoked by the Romans against some of their neighbors, and information about Roman bathing practices. The <b>Great Bath</b> is now roofless, and the statuary and pillars belong to the 19th century, but much remains from the original complex, and the steaming, somewhat murky waters are undeniably evocative. There are free hourly tours of the baths, and in August you can take torch-lighted tours at night.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Adjacent to the Roman bath complex is the famed <b>Pump Room,</b> built in 1792-96, a rendezvous for members of 18th-century and 19th-century Bath society, who liked to check on the new arrivals to the city. Here Catherine Morland and Mrs. Allen \"paraded up and down for an hour, looking at everybody and speaking to no one,\" to quote from Jane Austen\'s <i>Northanger Abbey.</i> Today you can take in the elegant space—or you can simply, for a small fee, taste the fairly vile mineral water.

The cuckoo clock.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">So says Harry Lime, played by Orson Welles in the classic 1949 film <i>The Third Man.</i> He misspoke in two ways. First, the Swiss are an industrious, technologically advanced people. And second, they didn\'t invent the cuckoo clock. That was the work of the Germans living in the adjacent Black Forest.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The first cuckoo clock was designed and built in 1750 by Franz Anton Ketterer in Schönwald near Triberg. He cleverly produced the cuckoo sound with a pair of wooden whistles, each attached to a bellows activated by the clock\'s mechanism.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The making of carved wooden clocks developed rapidly in the Black Forest. The people on the farms needed ways to profitably occupy their time during the long snowbound winters, and the carving of clocks was the answer. Wood was abundant, and the early clocks were entirely of wood, even the works.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Come spring one of the sons would don a traditional smock and hat, mount the family\'s winter output on a big rack, hoist it to his back, and set off into the world to sell the clocks. In 1808 there were 688 clock makers and 582 clock peddlers in the districts of Triberg and Neustadt. The <i>Uhrenträger</i> (clock carrier) is an important part of the Black Forest tradition. Guides often wear his costume.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The traditional cuckoo clock is made with brown stained wood with a gabled roof and some sort of woodland motif carved into it, such as a deer\'s head or a cluster of leaves. The works are usually activated by cast-iron weights, in the form of pinecones, on chains.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Today\'s clocks can be much more elaborate. Dancing couples in traditional dress automatically move to the sound of a music box, a mill wheel turns on the hour, a farmer chops wood on the hour, the Uhrenträger even makes his rounds. The cuckoo itself moves its wings and beak and rocks back and forth when calling.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The day is long past when the clocks were made entirely of wood. The works are of metal and therefore more reliable and accurate. Other parts of the clock, such as the whistles, the face, and the hands, are usually of plastic now, but hand-carved wood is still the rule for the case. The industry is still centered in Triberg. There are two museums in the area with sections dedicated to it, and clocks are sold everywhere, even in kiosks.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It was actually the introduction of the railroad in the 19th century that put travel to Brittany in vogue, and it was here that Gauguin and other like-minded artists founded the noted Pont-Aven School. Inspired by the vibrant colors and lovely vistas to be found here, they created <i>synthétisme,</i> a painting style characterized by broad patches of pure color and strong symbolism, in revolt against the dominant Impressionist school back in Paris. Gauguin arrived in the summer of 1886, happy to find a place \"where you can live on nothing\" (Paris\'s stock market had crashed and cost Gauguin his job). At Madame Gloanec\'s boardinghouse he welcomed a circle of painters to join him in his artistic quest for monumental simplicity and striking color.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Today Pont-Aven seems content to rest on its laurels. Although it\'s labeled a \"city of artists,\" the galleries that line its streets display paintings that lack the unifying theme and common creative energy of the earlier works of art. The first Pont-Aven painters were American students who came here in the 1850s. Though Gauguin is not-surprisingly absent (his paintings now go for millions), except for a few of his early zincographs, the exhibit <i>Hommage à Gauguin</i> is an interesting sketch of his turbulent life. Also on view in the museum are works by other near-great Pont-Aven artists: Maurice Denis, Émile Bernard, Émile Jordan, and Emmanuel Sérusier.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">No Mean Catch!</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To the great surprise of most North Americans, the humble canned sardine is a revered comestible—and justly so—among French <i>gourmands.</i> The best brands—Rodel, La Quibéronnaise, Gonidec, and La Belle Illoise—are from Brittany; the sardine industry was once the backbone of the Breton economy. The sardine tin, in fact, was invented by a Breton named Pierre-Joseph Colin in 1810. The preserved fish immediately made culinary history: Napoléon had thousands loaded into carts and brought to the Russian front, where the tasty little fish must have helped soften the blow of France\'s defeat. The best cans of sardines, usually marked <i>premîere catégorie</i> or <i>extra,</i> are treated like bottles of fine wine, carefully dated (some cans are even stamped with the name of the fishing boat credited with the catch), laid away in cellars for up to a decade and lovingly turned every few months for proper aging. Even the vocabulary for aged sardines is borrowed from oenology: one speaks of <i>grands crus</i> and <i>millésimes.</i> With the current trend toward \"limited-edition\" canned sardines, the oily fish has acceded to an even more exalted status. Purists take them straight, crushed onto a slice of buttered bread with the back of a fork, with perhaps the tiniest squeeze of lemon to bring out the oily flavors. Whichever way you wolf them down, vintage sardines are tender, delicately flavored, and deeply satisfying as a snack or an entire meal.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Topped with \"witches\' cap\" towers that the poet likened to Gothic crowns, the castle dates mainly from the 14th and 15th centuries. Here, quartered in the tower called \"La Tour du Chat,\" accompanied by roosting birds, a sinister quiet, and the ghost of a wooden-legged Comte de Combourg—whose false leg would reputedly get up and walk by itself—the young René succumbed to the château\'s moody spell and, in turn, became a leading light of Romanticism. His novel <i>Atala and René,</i> about a tragic love affair between a French soldier and a Native American maiden, was an international sensation in the mid-19th century, while his multivolume <i>History of Christianity</i> was required reading for half of Europe. The château grounds—ponds, woods, and cattle-strewn meadowland—are suitably mournful and can seem positively desolate when viewed under leaden skies. Its melancholy is best captured in Chateaubriand\'s famous <i>Mémoires d\'outre-tombe</i> (Memories from Beyond the Tomb).

He built the Springs in his image of \"Little London\" and gave his personal estate, Glen Eyrie, a Scottish name. Though he built his castlelike home for his wife, whom he adoringly called Queenie, you could say he was the homemaker in the relationship. Gathering treasures from the four corners of the old country, he was responsible for furnishing and decorating their expansive abode. Despite his preference for all things European, Palmer was as American as any other Andrew Carnegie-era philanthropist. He carefully planned Colorado Springs, donated a fortune in land for parks, and brought cottonwood trees from the Arkansas River valley to shade the streets. Take a day to trace the good general\'s steps, spending a night at the castle, just north of the Garden of the Gods. Awaken to the same sight he did: early-morning sun lighting the red-rock formations beneath a blue Colorado sky. Then hike a bit on the local trails (you can get permission for this from the present caretakers, the Navigators Christian ministry). Palmer was known to survey the grounds daily, by foot or horseback. Breathe the mountain air and listen to babbling brooks before returning to the landscaped green lawns. When done with your day at Glen Eyrie, drive to the intersection of Platte and Nevada in downtown Colorado Springs, where a statue of the general seems to direct traffic adjacent to Acacia Park, one of many parks that came to be because of his generous land donations. In the cool of the shade, offer the old boy a salute.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Here you can stroll around the village green, look into some of the historic houses, and stop at the Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve for a walk along the estuary and barrier beach. Take some time to check out the village of Woods Hole, the center for international marine research and the year-round ferry port for Martha\'s Vineyard. A small aquarium in town has regional sea-life exhibits, and there are several shops and museums. If you have any extra time, spend it north of here in the lovely old town of Sandwich, known for the Sandwich Glass Museum and the beautiful grounds and collection of antique cars at Heritage Museums and Gardens.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Days 2 &amp; 3: Hyannis</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The crowded Mid Cape is a center of activity, and its hub is Hyannis. Here you can take a cruise around the harbor or go on a deep-sea fishing trip. There are shops and restaurants along Main Street and plenty of kid-worthy amusements. Kennedy fans shouldn\'t miss the JFK Museum. End the day with a concert at the Cape Cod Melody Tent. Spend your second day exploring the northern reaches of the Mid Cape with a drive along scenic Route 6, which passes through the charming, slow-paced villages of Barnstable, Yarmouth Port, and Dennis. There are beaches and salt marshes, museums, antiques shops and galleries, and old graveyards along this route. Yarmouth Port\'s Bass Hole Boardwalk makes for a particularly beautiful stroll. In Dennis there are historic houses to tour, and the Cape Museum of Fine Arts merits a stop. End the day by climbing 30-foot Scargo Tower to watch the sun set. At night you can catch a film at the Cape Cinema, on the grounds of the Cape Playhouse.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Days 4 &amp; 5: Chatham</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chatham, with its handsome Main Street, is a perfect base for strolling, shopping, and dining. A trip to the nearby Monomoy Islands is a must for bird-watchers and nature lovers. Back in town, you can watch glassblowing at the Chatham Glass Company, visit the Old Atwood House and Railroad Museums, and drive over to take in the view from Chatham Light. Spend your second day detouring up to Brewster to check out the eclectic mix of antiques shops, museums, freshwater ponds for swimming and fishing, and miles of biking and hiking trails through Nickerson State Park. Don\'t miss the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History. On the way north from Chatham, take the less-commercial end of Route 28 to Orleans, driving past sailboat-speckled views of Pleasant Bay. On the way up toward Provincetown, stop in Eastham at the National Seashore\'s Salt Pond Visitor Center.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Days 6 &amp; 7: Provincetown</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bustling Provincetown sits at the very tip of the Cape, and there\'s a lot to see and do here. Catch a whale-watch boat and take a trolley tour in town or bike through the National Seashore on its miles of trails. Climb the Pilgrim Monument for a spectacular view of the area—on an exceptionally clear day you can see the Boston skyline. Visit the museums and shops and art galleries, or spend the afternoon swimming and sunning on one of the beaches. To escape the crowds, spend a day driving south through sleepy but scenic Truro and then park your car in Wellfleet\'s historic downtown, where you\'ll find a bounty of intriguing shops and galleries. Continue a bit south to historic Marconi Station, which was the landing point for the transatlantic telegraph early in the 20th century. It\'s also worth walking the short but stunning White Cedar Swamp Trail.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Alternatives</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On Day 2, hop the ferry for a day trip to either Martha\'s Vineyard or Nantucket. Both islands offer breathtaking scenery and village centers chock-full of great shops and restaurants. And if you\'re really keen on exploring either island, consider spending the night. Martha\'s Vineyard requires a shorter ferry ride and is your best choice if time is tight.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On either your first or final day—especially if you\'re a history buff or you\'re traveling with kids—pass through Plymouth, on the mainland just north of Sagamore Bridge, and make a visit to Plimoth Plantation, one of the most impressive living-history museums in the country.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Quintessential Cape Cod</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Two-Wheel-Drive</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There\'s no better mode of transportation for touring the Cape than a bike. It\'s along one of several outstanding trails that you can see verdant forests, hear birds chirp, and smell the salt air.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Cape\'s many well-developed bike trails satisfy avid and occasional cyclists alike. The definitive route, the Cape Cod Rail Trail, offers a particularly memorable ride along 25-mi of paved right-of-way of the old Penn Central Railroad. The Cape Cod National Seashore maintains three bicycle trails that wind through stunning wilderness, amid dunes, marshes, and ponds. And Falmouth\'s Shining Sea Trail offers an easy 3½-mi route along the coast, providing views of Vineyard Sound and dipping into oak and pine woods. In fact, there\'s good biking in just about every town on Cape Cod, plus a number of bike-rental shops.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Play Ball!</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">America\'s national pastime, baseball, takes on special meaning each summer on Cape Cod. It\'s here that you can watch the sport in its purest form, without having to deal with pricey tickets, prima donna ballplayers, and riotous crowds. The Cape Cod Baseball League comprises 10 teams and has been going strong since the 1950s, attracting top college ballplayers from around the country.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">These guys are talented—on par with midrange minor-league professional players. In fact, dozens of today\'s big stars began playing on the Cape, from Nomar Garciaparra to Jeff Bagwell. The games are held at relatively simple yet classic ball fields, so grab a hot dog and catch a game of baseball the way it was meant to be played.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Lobster Lovin\'</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Scores of eateries and markets on the Cape serve lobster, usually the traditional way—boiled whole in the shell with drawn butter—but also in pies, bisques, quesadillas, and omelets. At the Yarmouth House Restaurant, you can order a delicious filet mignon topped with fresh-picked lobster meat. Or opt for the standard summer lunch treat, a lobster roll—light lobster salad with just a hint of mayo on a plain white frankfurter roll.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Wherever you try it, don\'t leave Cape Cod without sampling this revered culinary offering. And if you get a hankering for lobsters once you get home, just call Quality Fresh Seafood in Bourne—they can airmail you a full clambake, complete with a whole lobster ready for steaming.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Seeing the Light</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In addition to traditional Cape-style houses, Cape Cod is known for another distinctive architectural type: lighthouses. You\'ll find them up and down the Cape, some still active, others decommissioned.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Each has its own personality and profile. There\'s Highland Light in Truro, the Cape\'s oldest. Eastham\'s oft-photographed Nauset Light ranks among the most beautiful, and both Chatham Light and Falmouth\'s Nobska Light afford some of the best views. In Martha\'s Vineyard, be sure to journey out to Aquinnah Lighthouse, which stands atop a bluff above the beach and crashing surf. It\'s definitely worth ascending any lighthouse open for tours (several are, albeit with limited hours) to enjoy a magical perspective of the Cape\'s spectacular landscape.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Parking is for residents and renters with stickers only, although anyone can walk or bicycle in to enjoy this pristine swath of golden sand that stretches for miles in either direction and sees relatively few crowds—even in the heart of summer. Keep in mind that the parking area is small and tends to fill quickly. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Heritage Museums and Gardens</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Heritage Museums and Gardens, 100 beautifully landscaped acres overlooking the upper end of Shawme Pond, includes gardens and a café as well as an impressive complex of museum buildings with specialty collections ranging from cars to toys. In 1967 pharmaceuticals magnate Josiah K. Lilly III purchased the estate and turned it into a nonprofit museum. A highlight is the Shaker Round Barn, which showcases classic and historic cars—including a 1930 yellow-and-green Duesenberg built for Gary Cooper, a 1919 Pierce-Arrow, a 1915 Milburn Light Electric, and a 1911 Stanley Steamer—as well as art exhibitions. The American History museum houses the Cape Cod Baseball League Hall of Fame as well as antique firearms, a collection of 2,000 hand-painted miniature soldiers, military uniforms, and Native American arts. The art museum has an extensive Currier &amp; Ives collection, Americana (including a mechanical-bank collection), antique toys such as a 1920 Hubley Royal Circus, and a working 1912 Coney Island-style carousel that both adults and little ones can ride as often as they like. A shuttle bus—equipped with a wheelchair lift and space to stow baby strollers—transports visitors every few minutes from the car museum to other exhibit sites.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Paths crisscross the grounds, which include gardens planted with daylilies, hostas, heather, herbs, and fruit trees. Rhododendron enthusiasts will recognize the name of onetime estate owner and hybridizer Charles O. Dexter; the rhododendrons are in full glory from mid-May through mid-June. Daylilies reach their peak from mid-July through early August. Families visiting with youngsters should ask at the ticket office for Family Funpacks with children\'s activities, or the Clue tours—scavenger-hunt games for exploring the grounds. In summer, concerts are held in the gardens, often on Wednesday or Saturday evening or Sunday afternoon. The center of the complex is about ¾ mi on foot from the in-town end of Shawme Pond. www.heritagemuseumsandgardens.org. COST: $12. OPEN: Apr.-Nov., daily 10-5; Nov.-Mar., call for very limited hrs. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Marconi Beach</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Marconi Beach, part of the Cape Cod National Seashore, charges $15 for daily parking or $45 for a season pass that provides access to all six National Seashore swimming beaches. There are lifeguards, restrooms, and outdoor showers from late June through early September, which is the only period when admission fees are collected. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cape Cod Museum of Natural History</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For nature enthusiasts, a visit to the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History is a must; it\'s just a short drive west from the heart of Brewster along Route 6A. The spacious museum and pristine grounds include guided field walks, a shop, a natural-history library, lectures, classes, nature and marine exhibits such as a working beehive, and a pond- and sea-life room with live specimens. Walking trails wind through 80 acres of forest, marshland, and ponds, all rich in birds and other wildlife. The exhibit hall upstairs has a wall display of aerial photographs documenting the process by which the famous Chatham sandbar was split in two. The museum also has guided canoe and kayak trips from May through September and several cruises that explore Cape waterways. Onboard naturalists point out the wildlife and relay historical information about each habitat. Call for tour times and fees, and sign up as early as you can. The museum has wildlife movies and slide lectures in the auditorium on Wednesday at 7:30, from early July through August. There are children\'s and family activities in summer, including full- and half-day workshops and one- and two-week day camps consisting of art and nature classes for preschoolers through ninth graders. www.ccmnh.org. COST: $8. OPEN: Oct.-Dec. and Feb.-Mar., Wed.-Sun. noon-4; Apr. and May, Wed.-Sun. 10-4; June-Sept., daily 9:30-4; closed Jan. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Race Point Beach</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Race Point Beach, one of the Cape Cod National Seashore beaches in Provincetown, has a wide swath of sand stretching far off into the distance around the point and Coast Guard station. Behind the beach is pure duneland, and bike trails lead off the parking lot. Because of its position on a point facing north, the beach gets sun all day long (east coast beaches get fullest sun early in the day). Parking is available, there are showers and restrooms, and lifeguards are stationed in season. From late June through early September, parking costs $15 per day, or $45 for a yearly pass good at all National Seashore beaches. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

There are hiking trails to fit all levels of experience and fitness. If you\'re short on time, make it a point to spend at least half a day out of the car and on the trail. For what seems like a small, parched, and desolate corner of the state, southwestern Utah offers an impressive diversity of hiking climates, from cool evergreen forests at alpine elevations near 10,000 feet to hot desert washes sprinkled with sandstone and sage.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you have the motivation and ability, consider a multiday backpacking trip into the region\'s wild backcountry. Time your trip right and you can experience true wilderness at comfortable temperatures and, most importantly, without the crowds of the Wasatch. The peaks of the Pine Valley Wilderness warm to comfortable levels in spring, summer, and fall and are generally forsaken for the parks on the other side of I-15 during these seasons. Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument contains nearly 2 million acres of desert plains, canyons, and badlands, though you will probably want to wait until the cooler fall and winter months to set out on your backcountry adventure here. Safety precautions are critical on any trip: travel in groups, prepare for all weather conditions in any season, and don\'t embark without notifying several people of your itinerary. If you don\'t feel comfortable leading your own trip, consider contacting a local outfitter about the availability of guided trips.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Though the highway starts at the intersection of U.S. 89, west of Bryce Canyon National Park, the stretch that begins in Escalante is one of the most spectacular. The road passes through Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and on to Capitol Reef along one of the most scenic stretches of highway in the United States. Be sure to stop at the scenic overlooks; almost every one will give you an eye-popping view. Don\'t get distracted, though; the paved road is twisting and steep, and at times climbs over a hogback with sheer drop-offs on both sides. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hike the world-famous rock expanse known as \"The Wave\" in the remote and rugged Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness, beyond the southern boundary of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and along the Arizona border. Permits to hike the Wave—envision ocean waves frozen in striated red, orange, and yellow sandstone—and some of the other trails here are available online and usually are reserved many months in advance. However, if you arrive before 9 AM, you may be one of the 10 lucky walk-ins who can score a permit to hike the <i>following</i> day. It\'s not first-come, first-served; if more than 10 people show up, names are placed in a hat and drawn at random. By limiting the number of people who access the backcountry, the Bureau of Land Management hopes to preserve this area for years to come. From November 16 to March 14, apply for walk-in permits at 318 N. 100 East Street in Kanab; the rest of the year visit the Paria Information Station at the turnoff for the monument. www.blm.gov. COST: $5 fee, reservations and permits required for some hikes.

The construction program was monstrous: entire villages were razed, 18,000 workmen called in, and architect Louis Le Vau, painter Charles Le Brun, and landscape architect André Le Nôtre recruited at vast expense to prove that Fouquet\'s taste was as refined as his business acumen. The housewarming party was so lavish it had star guest Louis XIV, tetchy at the best of times, spitting jealous curses. He hurled Fouquet in the slammer and set about building Versailles to prove just who was top banana.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The high-roof château, partially surrounded by a moat, is set well back from the road behind iron railings topped with sculpted heads. A cobbled avenue stretches up to the entrance, and stone steps lead to the vestibule, which seems small given the noble scale of the exterior. Charles Le Brun\'s captivating decoration includes the ceiling of the <b>Chambre du Roi</b> (Royal Bedchamber), depicting <i>Time Bearing Truth Heavenward,</i> framed by stuccowork by sculptors François Girardon and André Legendre. Along the frieze you can make out small squirrels, the Fouquet family\'s emblem—squirrels are known as <i>fouquets</i> in local dialect. But Le Brun\'s masterwork is the ceiling in the <b>Salon des Muses</b> (Hall of Muses), a brilliant allegorical composition painted in glowing, sensuous colors that some feel even surpasses his work at Versailles. On the ground floor the impressive <b>Grand Salon</b> (Great Hall), with its unusual oval form and 16 caryatid pillars symbolizing the months and seasons, has harmony and style even though the ceiling decoration was never finished.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The state salons are redolent of <i>le style louisquartorze,</i> thanks to the grand state beds, Mazarin desks, and Baroque marble busts—gathered together by the current owners of the château, the Comte et Comtesse de Vogüé—that replace the original pieces, which Louis XIV trundled off as booty to Versailles. In the basement, whose cool, dim rooms were used to store food and wine and house the château\'s kitchens, you can find rotating exhibits about the château\'s past and life-size wax figures illustrating its history, including the notorious 19th-century murder-suicide of two erstwhile owners, the Duc and Duchess de Choiseul-Praslin. The house has been featured in many Hollywood films, including <i>Moonraker.</i>Le Nôtre\'s carefully restored <b>gardens</b> are at their best when the fountains are turned on (the second and final Saturday of each month from April through October, 3-6 pm). www.vaux-le-vicomte.com.

In the late 9th century Charles II (known as the Bald) presented Chartres with what was believed to be the tunic of the Virgin Mary, a precious relic that went on to attract hordes of pilgrims. The current cathedral, the sixth church on the spot, dates mainly from the 12th and 13th centuries and was erected after the previous building, dating from the 11th century, burned down in 1194. A well-chronicled outburst of religious fervor followed the discovery that the Virgin Mary\'s relic had miraculously survived unsinged. Princes and paupers, barons and bourgeois gave their money and their labor to build the new cathedral. Ladies of the manor came to help monks and peasants on the scaffolding in a tremendous resurgence of religious faith that followed the Second Crusade. Just 25 years were needed for Chartres Cathedral to rise again, and it has remained substantially unchanged since.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The lower half of the facade survives from the earlier Romanesque church: this can be seen most clearly in the use of round arches rather than the pointed Gothic type. The <b>Royal Portal</b> is richly sculpted with scenes from the life of Christ—these sculpted figures are among the greatest created during the Middle Ages. The taller of the two spires (380 feet versus 350 feet) was built at the start of the 16th century, after its predecessor was destroyed by fire; its fanciful Flamboyant intricacy contrasts sharply with the stumpy solemnity of its Romanesque counterpart (access EUR 3, open daily 9:30-noon and 2-4:30). The <b>rose window</b> above the main portal dates from the 13th century, and the three windows below it contain some of the finest examples of 12th-century stained-glass artistry in France.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As spiritual as Chartres is, the cathedral also had its more-earthbound uses. Look closely and you can see that the main nave floor has a subtle slant. This was built to provide drainage, as this part of the church was often used as a \"hostel\" by thousands of overnighting pilgrims in medieval times.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Your eyes will need time to adjust to the somber interior. The reward is seeing the gemlike richness of the stained glass, with the famous deep Chartres blue predominating. The oldest window is arguably the most beautiful: <b>Notre-Dame de la Belle Verrière</b> (Our Lady of the Lovely Window), in the south choir. The cathedral\'s windows are being gradually cleaned—a lengthy, painstaking process—and the contrast with those still covered in the grime of centuries is staggering. It\'s worth taking a pair of binoculars along with you to pick out the details. If you wish to know more about stained-glass techniques and the motifs used, visit the small exhibit in the gallery opposite the north porch. For even more detail, try to arrange a tour (in English) with local institution Malcolm Miller, whose knowledge of the cathedral\'s history is formidable. (He leads tours twice a day Monday through Saturday; the cost is EUR 10. You can reach him at the telephone number below.) The vast black-and-white labyrinth on the floor of the nave is one of the few to have survived from the Middle Ages; the faithful were expected to travel along its entire length (some 300 yards) on their knees. Guided tours of the <b>Crypte</b> start from the Maison de la Crypte opposite the south porch. You can also see a 4th-century Gallo-Roman wall and some 12th-century wall paintings. www.chartres-tourisme.com. COST: Crypt EUR 3. OPEN: Cathedral 8:30-7:30, guided tours of crypt Apr.-Oct., daily at 11, 2:15, 3:30, and 4:30; Nov.-Mar., daily at 11 and 4:15. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Château de Compiègne</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The 18th-century Château de Compiègne, where the future Louis XVI first met Marie-Antoinette in 1770, was restored by Napoléon I and favored for wild weekends by his nephew Napoléon III. The first Napoléon\'s legacy is more keenly felt: his state apartments have been refurbished using the original designs for hangings and upholstery, and bright silks and damasks adorn every room. Much of the mahogany furniture gleams with ormolu, and the chairs sparkle with gold leaf. Napoléon III\'s furniture looks ponderous by comparison. Behind the palace is a gently rising 4-km (2½-mi) vista, inspired by the park at Schönbrunn, in Vienna, where Napoléon I\'s second wife, Empress Marie-Louise, grew up. Also here is the <b>Musée du Second Empire,</b> a collection of Napoléon III-era decorative arts. The showstopper here is Franz-Xaver Winterhalter\'s <i>Empress Eugénie Surrounded by Her Ladies in Waiting,</i> a famed homage to the over-the-top hedonism of the Napoléon Trois era. Make time for the <b>Musée de la Voiture</b> and its display of carriages, coaches, and old cars, including the <i>Jamais Contente</i> (<i>Never Satisfied</i>), the first car to reach 100 kph (62 mph). www.musee-chateau-compiegne.fr. COST: EUR 6.50. OPEN: Closed Tues. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Disneyland Paris</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Disneyland Paris (originally called Euro Disney) is probably not what you\'ve traveled to France to experience. But if you have a child in tow, the promise of a day here may get you through an afternoon at Versailles or Fontainebleau. If you\'re a dyed-in-the-wool Disney fan, you\'ll want to make a beeline for the park to see how it has been molded to appeal to the tastes of Europeans (Disney\'s \"Imagineers\" call it their most lovingly detailed park). And if you\'ve never experienced this particular form of Disney showmanship, you may want to put in an appearance if only to see what all the fuss is about. When it opened, few turned up to do so; today the place is jammed with crowds, and Disneyland Paris is here to stay—and grow, with <b>Walt Disney Studios</b> opened alongside it in 2002.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Disneyland Park,</b> as the original theme park is styled, consists of five \"lands\": Main Street U.S.A., Frontierland, Adventureland, Fantasyland, and Discoveryland. The central theme of each land is relentlessly echoed in every detail, from attractions to restaurant menus to souvenirs. The park is circled by a railroad, which stops three times along the perimeter. <b>Main Street U.S.A.</b> goes under the railroad and past shops and restaurants toward the main plaza; Disney parades are held here every afternoon and, during holiday periods, every evening.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Top attractions at <b>Frontierland</b> are the chilling Phantom Manor, haunted by holographic spooks, and the thrilling runaway mine train of Big Thunder Mountain, a roller coaster that plunges wildly through floods and avalanches in a setting meant to evoke Utah\'s Monument Valley. Whiffs of Arabia, Africa, and the West Indies give <b>Adventureland</b> its exotic cachet; the spicy meals and snacks served here rank among the best food in the park. Don\'t miss the Pirates of the Caribbean, an exciting mise-en-scène populated by eerily humanlike, computer-driven figures, or Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, a breathtaking ride that re-creates some of this luckless hero\'s most exciting moments.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Fantasyland</b> charms the youngest parkgoers with familiar cartoon characters from such classic Disney films as <i>Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo,</i> and <i>Peter Pan.</i> The focal point of Fantasyland, and indeed Disneyland Paris, is Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant (Sleeping Beauty\'s Castle), a 140-foot, bubblegum-pink structure topped with 16 blue- and gold-tipped turrets. Its design was allegedly inspired by illustrations from a medieval <i>Book of Hours</i>—if so, it was by way of Beverly Hills. The castle\'s dungeon conceals a 2-ton scaly green dragon that rumbles in its sleep and occasionally rouses to roar—an impressive feat of engineering, producing an answering chorus of shrieks from younger children. <b>Discoveryland</b> is a futuristic eye-knocker for high-tech Disney entertainment. Robots on roller skates welcome you on your way to Star Tours, a pitching, plunging, sense-confounding ride based on the <i>Star Wars</i> films. In Le Visionarium, a simulated space journey is presented by 9-Eye, a staggeringly realistic robot. One of the park\'s newest attractions, the Jules Verne-inspired <b>Space Mountain Mission 2,</b> pretends to catapult <i>exploronauts</i> on a rocket-boosted, comet-battered journey through the Milky Way.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Disneyland Paris is peppered with places to eat, ranging from snack bars and fast-food joints to five full-service restaurants—all with a distinguishing theme. In addition, Walt Disney Studios, Disney Village, and Disney Hotels have restaurants open to the public. But since these are outside the park, it\'s not recommended that you waste time traveling to them for lunch. Disneyland Paris has relaxed its no-alcohol policy and now serves wine and beer in the park\'s sit-down restaurants, as well as in the hotels and restaurants outside the park.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Walt Disney Studios</b> opened next to the Disneyland Park in 2002. The theme park is divided into four \"production zones.\" Beneath imposing entrance gates and a 100-foot water tower inspired by the one erected in 1939 at Disney Studios in Burbank, California, <b>Front Lot</b> contains shops, a restaurant, and a studio re-creating the atmosphere of Sunset Boulevard. In <b>Animation Courtyard,</b> Disney artists demonstrate the various phases of character animation; Animagique brings to life scenes from <i>Pinocchio</i> and <i>The Lion King</i>; while the Genie from <i>Aladdin</i> pilots Flying Carpets over Agrabah. <b>Production Courtyard</b> hosts the Walt Disney Television Studios; Cinémagique, a special-effects tribute to U.S. and European cinema; and a behind-the-scenes Studio Tram tour of location sites, movie props, studio decor, and costuming, ending with a visit to Catastrophe Canyon in the heart of a film shoot. <b>Back Lot</b> majors in stunts. At Armageddon Special Effects you can confront a flaming meteor shower aboard the Mir space station, then complete your visit at the giant outdoor arena with a Stunt Show Spectacular involving cars, motorbikes, and Jet Skis. www.disneylandparis.com. COST: EUR 46, EUR 128 for 3-day Passport; includes admission to all individual attractions within Disneyland or Walt Disney Studios, but not meals; tickets for Walt Disney Studios are also valid for admission to Disneyland during last 3 opening hrs of same day.

Walt Disney Studios daily 10-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Château de Chantilly</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although its lavish exterior may be 19th-century Renaissance pastiche, the Château de Chantilly, sitting snugly behind an artificial lake, houses the outstanding <b>Musée Condé,</b> with illuminated medieval manuscripts, tapestries, furniture, and paintings. The most famous room, the <b>Santuario</b> (sanctuary), contains two celebrated works by Italian painter Raphael (1483-1520)—the <i>Three Graces</i> and the <i>Orleans Virgin</i>—plus an exquisite ensemble of 15th-century miniatures by the most illustrious French painter of his time, Jean Fouquet (1420-81). Farther on, in the <b>Cabinet des Livres</b> (library), is the world-famous Book of Hours whose title translates as <i>The Very Rich Hours of the Duc de Berry,</i> which was illuminated by the Brothers Limbourg with magical pictures of early-15th-century life as lived by one of Burgundy\'s richest lords (unfortunately, due to their fragility, painted facsimiles of the celebrated calendar illuminations are on display, not the actual pages of the book). Other highlights of this unusual museum are the <b>Galerie de Psyché</b> (Psyche Gallery), with 16th-century stained glass and portrait drawings by Flemish artist Jean Clouet II; the <b>Chapelle,</b> with sculptures by Jean Goujon and Jacques Sarrazin; and the extensive collection of paintings by 19th-century French artists, headed by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. In addition, there are grand and smaller salons, all stuffed with palace furniture, family portraits, and Sèvres porcelains, making this a must for lovers of the decorative and applied arts. www.chateaudechantilly.com. COST: EUR 11, joint ticket with park. OPEN: Apr.-Oct., daily 10-6; Nov.-Mar., Wed.-Mon. 10:30-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Château de Versailles</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Today the château seems monstrously big, but it wasn\'t large enough for the army of 20,000 noblemen, servants, and hangers-on who moved in with Louis. A new city—a new capital, in fact—had to be constructed from scratch to accommodate them. Tough-thinking town planners promptly dreamed up vast mansions and avenues broader than the Champs-Élysées—all in bicep-flexing baroque.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It was hardly surprising that Louis XIV\'s successors rapidly felt out of sync with their architectural inheritance. Louis XV and Louis XVI preferred to cower in small retreats in the gardens, well out of the mighty château\'s shadow. The two most famous of these structures are the Petit Trianon, a model of classical harmony and proportion built for Louis XV, and the Hameau, where Marie-Antoinette could play at being a shepherdess amid the ersatz rusticity of her Potemkin hamlet. The contrast between the majestic and the domesticated is an important part of Versailles\'s appeal. But pomp and bombast tend to prevail, and you won\'t need reminding that you\'re in the world\'s grandest palace—or one of France\'s most popular tourist attractions. The park and gardens outside are a great place to stretch your legs while taking in details of formal landscaping.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the highlights of the tour is the dazzling <b>Galerie des Glaces</b> (Hall of Mirrors). Lavish balls were once held here, as was a later event with much greater world impact: the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which put an end to World War I on June 28, 1919. <b>Grands Appartements</b> (State Apartments) are whipped into a lather of decoration, with painted ceilings, marble walls, parquet floors, and canopy beds topped with ostrich plumes. The <b>Petits Appartements</b> (Private Apartments) where the royal family and friends lived are on a more human scale, lined with 18th-century gold and white rococo boiseries. The <b>Opéra Royal</b>, the first oval hall in France, was designed for Louis XV. Check out the \"marble\" loges—they\'re actually painted wood. The solemn white-and-gold <b>chapel</b> was completed in 1710—the king and queen attended daily mass here seated in gilt boxes. Completed in 1701 in the Louis-XIV style, the <b>Apartements du Roi</b> (King\'s Apartments) comprise a suite of 15 rooms set in a \"U\" around the east facade\'s Marble Court. The <b>Chambre de la Reine</b> (Queen\'s Bed Chamber), probably the most opulent bedroom in the world, was initially created for Marie Thé[ac]rèse, first wife of Louis XIV, to be part of the Queen\'s Apartments.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Despite its sprawl, the palace of Versailles can get stiflingly crowded, especially as visitors are funneled through one narrow side of most of the rooms, with the furniture and objets d\'art roped off. You may be able to avoid the crowds (and lines for tours) if you arrive here at 9 AM. The main entrance is near the top of the courtyard to the right; there are different lines depending on tour, physical ability, and group status. Frequent guided tours in English visit the private royal apartments. More detailed hour-long tours explore the opera house or Marie Antoinette\'s private parlors. You can go through the grandest rooms—including the Hall of Mirrors and Marie Antoinette\'s stunningly opulent bed chamber—without a group tour. To figure out the system, pick up a brochure at the information office or ticket counter. www.chateauversailles.fr. COST: EUR 13.50. OPEN: Apr.-Oct., Tues.-Sun. 9-6:30; Nov.-Mar., Tues.-Sun. 9-5:30. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">La Malmaison</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Built in 1622, La Malmaison was bought by the future empress Joséphine in 1799 as a love nest for Napoléon and herself (they had married three years earlier). Theirs is one of Europe\'s most dramatic love stories, replete with affairs, hatred (the emperor\'s family often disparaged Joséphine—a name bestowed on her by Napoléon: her real name was Rose—as \"the Creole\"), and scandal. After the childless Joséphine was divorced by the heir-hungry emperor in 1809, she retired to La Malmaison and died here on May 29, 1814.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The château has 24 rooms furnished with exquisite tables, chairs, and sofas of the Napoleonic period; of special note are the library, game room, and dining room. The walls are adorned with works by artists of the day, such as Jacques-Louis David, Pierre-Paul Prud\'hon, and Baron Gérard. Take time to admire the clothes and hats that belonged to Napoléon and Joséphine, particularly the empress\'s gowns. Their carriage can be seen in one of the garden pavilions, and another pavilion contains a unique collection of snuffboxes donated by Prince George of Greece. The gardens themselves are delightful, especially the regimented rows of tulips in spring. The Bois Préau, Josephine\'s house after her divorce from the emperor, is nearby but is now undergoing a multiyear renovation. www.chateau-malmaison.fr. COST: EUR 5.

The <b>Dinosaur Quarry</b> (Visitor center: 7 mi north of Jensen, Utah, on Rte. 139. tel. 970/374-3000), is closed because of damage to the structural integrity of the building. There is a temporary visitor center set up, and although the main exhibit wall of dinosaur fossils is also closed, some of them can still be seen by hiking about a half mile from the temporary site. A shuttle bus carries visitors from the temporary visitor center to the quarry. The Colorado side of the park offers some of the best hiking in the West, along the Harpers Corner and Echo Park Drive routes, and the ominous-sounding Canyon of Lodore (where the Green River rapids buffet rafts).

It begins at Mollepata, four hours by road from Cusco, and is a strenuous hike that goes through a 4,800-meter (15,700-foot) pass. The Salcantay excursion joins the Inca Trail at Huayllabamba.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Ausangate</b> trek takes its name from the Nevado Ausangate, 6,372 meters (20,900 feet) in elevation, and requires a day of travel each way from Cusco in addition to the standard five-six days on the trail. Nearly the entire excursion takes you on terrain over 4,000 meters (13,100 feet).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Relatively new to the region\'s trekking scene are four-day hikes through the <b>Lares Valley</b>, north of Urubamba and Ollantaytambo. The excursion offers a cultural dimension, with stops at several villages along the way. The Lares trek compares in difficulty to the Inca Trail.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Various treks bearing the name of <b>Choquequirao</b> take in ruins that some have trumpeted as \"the new Machu Picchu,\" another long-lost Inca city.

In the small gallery are the maguey-wood and rice-plaster sculptures of the Virgin with the elongated necks that were the artist\'s trademark. There\'s also a shop selling Mendívil style work. COST: Free. OPEN: Mon.—Sat. 9-1 and 2-6. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Catedral</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Dominating the Plaza de Armas, the monumental Cathedral is one of Cusco\'s grandest buildings. Built in 1550 on the site of the palace of the Inca Wirachocha and using stones looted from the nearby Inca fortress of Sacsayhuaman, the Cathedral is a perfect example of the imposition of the Catholic faith on the indigenous population. The grander the building, went the theory, the more impressive (and seductive) the faith. With soaring ceilings, baroque carvings, enormous oil paintings, and glittering gold-and-silver altars, the Cathedral certainly seemed to achieve its aim.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Today Cusco\'s Cathedral is one of the town\'s star attractions, noted mainly for its amazing collection of colonial art that mixes Christian and non-Christian imagery. Entering the Cathedral from the Sagrada Familia chapel, head to your right to the first nave where you\'ll find the famous oil painting (reputed to be the oldest in Cusco) depicting the earthquake that rocked the town in 1650. Among the depictions of burning houses and people fleeing, you\'ll see a procession in the Plaza. Legend has it that during the earthquake, the citizens took out from the Cathedral a statue of Jesus on the cross and paraded it around the Plaza—halting the quake in its tracks. This statue, now known as the Señor de los Temblores, or Lord of the Earthquakes, is Cusco\'s patron, and you\'ll find him depicted in many Cusqueñan paintings—you\'ll recognise him by his frilly white skirt.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To see the famous statue, head across the Cathedral to the other side, where in the nave and to the right of the passage connecting the Cathedral to the adjoining Iglesia del Triumfo, you\'ll find el Señor himself. The dark color of his skin is often claimed to be a representation of the indigenous people of Cusco; the scientific explanation is that it\'s natural discoloration due to the statue\'s age.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Those interested in the crossover between indigenous and Catholic iconography will find lots to look at. Figures of pumas, the Inca representation of the earth, are carved on the enormous main doors, and in the adjoining Iglesia del Triumfo you\'ll see an Andean Christ in one of the altars flanking the exit. No one should miss the spectacular Last Supper, painted by the indigenous artist Marcos Zapata, where you\'ll see the diners tucking into a delicious feast of cuy (guinea pig) and chicha (corn beverage)!</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The cathedral\'s centerpieces are its massive, solid-silver altar, and the enormous 1659 María Angola bell, the largest in South America, which hangs in one of the towers and can be heard from miles away. Behind the main altar is the original wooden <i>altar primitivo</i> dedicated to St. Paul. The 64-seat cedar choir has rows of carved saints, popes, and bishops, all in stunning detail down to their delicately articulated hands.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Labels in Spanish and English are slowly being added to the more famous attractions in the Cathedral. If you\'re interested in a more in-depth look, enlist the services of a guide—they\'re easy to spot by their tracksuit-jacket uniforms. Agree on a price before you start. An audioguide system is currently in the works; these should be included in your ticket price when they are up and running. COST: S/16 or Boleto Integral.

Twelve rooms in the 1580 Casa Cabrera, which was used as the convent of Santa Clara until the 17th century, showcase an astounding collection of pre-Columbian art from the 13th to 16th centuries, mostly in the form of carvings, ceramics, and jewelry. The art and artifacts were made by the Huari and Nasca, as well as the Inca, cultures. The stylish displays have excellent labels in Spanish and English that place the artifacts in their artistic and historical context. On the walls is commentary from European artists on South American art. Swiss artist Paul Klee wrote: \"I wish I was newly born, and totally ignorant of Europe, innocent of facts and fashions, to be almost primitive.\" Most Cusco museums close at dark but MAP remains open every evening.

Retrace your route, then head to Telluride for lunch and a gondola ride up the mountain. Continue over Lizard Head Pass, stopping at the Anasazi Heritage Center in Dolores before spending the night in Cortez or Mancos. The next day, drive east to Durango, a good place to spend the night. The next morning, board the Durango &amp; Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, one of the state\'s must-see attractions.

Continue north through Creede and Lake City to return to Blue Mesa Reservoir.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 7 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Start your itinerary in Crested Butte, spending a day hiking amid the wildflowers, fishing in the crystal-clear streams, or just exploring this quaint mountain town.

Guardrails are few, hairpin turns are many, and behemoth RVs often seem to take more than their share of road. It earned its nickname either because the crushed ore used for the roadbed was rumored to contain gold and silver, or because of the fortune that 19th-century road builder Otto Mears spent to create it. This priceless road is kept open all winter by heroic plow crews. The Ouray side, on the whole, is steeper and narrower than the Silverton side.

In the lower Rhine Valley (Chur, Heidi-Land, etc), there are normally four distinct and equal seasons. Up in the Engadine, there are four seasons as well, but their distribution is heavily skewed toward winter. Snow can remain until May, and after a brief spring and summer you may experience flurries or frozen dew in August. So even if traveling in summer, pack some warm clothing, like a sweater and a windbreaker. The fall colors are well worth a trip—perhaps not as spectacular as New England, but very inspiring.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Getting Around</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Unless you intend to explore every nook and cranny of Graubünden or some of the more remote valleys, you will not really need a car. In fact, a car might cost more time and irritation than simply using public transportation. Virtually every village and major cable car, funicular or ski area is connected either by regular train service of the Rhätibahn (Rhätische Bahn or RhB, for short) trains or Swiss Post buses. On occasion, hotels often have pick-up service (the Stern in Chur uses a beautiful 1930s Buick, a genuine \"station\" wagon). Note that if you intend to use public transportation (recommended) a fair amount, you should consider purchasing a Swiss Pass or one of the many other options. For example, an 8-day Swiss Pass (giving you unlimited transportation on trains, buses, and ships; 50% discounts on many funiculars or cable cars; plus entrance to museums and many other perks) costs 362 SF. Compare this to the basic cost for a car rental: about 680 SF for 7 days—and you haven\'t tanked up yet or paid for parking.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Established in 1914, it covers 173 square km (107 square mi), including the Macun lakes near Lavin. Minute compared with a U.S. or Canadian national park, it has none of the developments that typically hint of \"accessibility\" and \"attraction\": no campgrounds, no picnic sites, no residents, few rangers. This is genuine wilderness, every leaf protected from all but nature itself. Dead wood is left to rot and insects to multiply. Rangers see that rules are obeyed—no fires, dogs, bikes, skis, or tents are allowed, and picking plants is forbidden. Although the last bear was shot in the Lower Engadine in 1904, the park is home to large herds of ibex (the heraldic animal on the Graubünden flag), chamois, red and roe deer, and marmots. Don\'t forget binoculars; without them you might not see much fauna—the animals give a wide berth to the 80 km (50 mi) of marked paths. Remember these are wild animals and not likely to line up for Twinkies by the road. If big game make no appearance, you can just enjoy the scenery and watch out for a bearded vulture overhead. Before heading into the park, visit the brand new <b>Nationalpark-Haus</b> in Zernez, where you can watch a video in English, stock up on maps, and enjoy the natural history exhibit, which includes a \"marmot underground experience.\" Guided walks in English are available on Tuesday and Thursday; reserve one to two days in advance to join a group (10 SF for adults) or book a private guided walk.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Trails start out from parking lots off the park\'s only highway (visitors are encouraged to take buses back to their starting point)—a series of wild, rough, and often steep paths. Visitors are restricted to the trails except at designated resting places. The Il Fuorn-Stabelchod-Val dal Botsch trail marks botanical and natural phenomena with multilingual information boards and leads to a spectacular barren ridge at 7,672 feet; the round-trip journey takes about four hours. A three-hour route from picturesque S-chanf (pronounced sss-<i>chanff</i>) takes you into a deep glacial valley where ibex and chamois often gather; the return, by a riverside trail, passes a snack bar—just across the park border and thus permitted. www.nationalpark.ch.

Looking like illustrator Howard Pyle\'s model for the Castle Drachenhausen in his beloved children\'s classic <i>Otto of the Silver Hand,</i> Tarasp lords over the valley with a impressive main tower, dating from the 11th century when the castle was built by the leading family of Tarasp. Tarasp became part of Austria in 1464; the imperial eagle still can be seen on the castle walls. In the early 1800s, Napoléon gave Tarasp to the canton Graubünden, newly part of the Swiss federation. The castle went through several owners and subsequent neglect before passing into private hands in the early 20th century. You must join a tour to see the interiors, which range from the Romanesque chapel to the opulent \"baronial\" 19th-century reception rooms; the schedule varies quite a bit, so call ahead for tour times. Special midnight tours are conducted during the full moon. The bus from Vulpera departs roughly every hour. It\'s a 1½ hour walk from Scuol, following a well marked path that goes over the Punt\'Ota (high bridge). www.schloss-tarasp.ch. COST: 10 SF.

Or at least that is what it was in the 1969 Bond movie. As eye-popping as granite-featured George Lazenby and the over-the-top plot (Blofeld means to use beautiful women as carriers for a lethal ecovirus), the Piz Gloria was ultimately blown up in the film, but the \"hideout\" was so memorable that it kept its stage name and became Europe\'s first revolving restaurant, still famous for its James Bond breakfast (no martinis, however), which allows you to watch the sun come up over the peaks. According to Joanna Lumley, one of the Bond Girls in the film: \"Ringed by range after range of mountains, the view was unparalleled, perfect; too perfect—it looked like a painted backcloth. A props man was given the task of enticing birds to fly around to show it was real.\"</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Meiringer By Any Other Name</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">According to local legend, meringues were invented in 1720 in the Bernese Oberland town of Meiringen by a Swiss confectioner named Gasparini. The popularity of the fluffy deserts was so great that they soon spread to neighboring France, where Marie Antoinette apparently was so taken with them that she was said to actually make them herself regularly at the Trianon. From the palaces of France the dish spread to the rest of the world, and it is the French angle that led to the name change: from the original meiringer to the more common meringue. Melt-in-your-mouth meringues are still a local specialty in Meiringen, where they are sold in dozens of pastry shops. To make them yourself, whip two parts egg whites together with one part sugar until the mass is light and fluffy. Bake for three hours at low heat, then let cool. Serve with a generous dollop of fresh whipped cream. Afterward, you might want to make an appointment with your personal trainer.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Time-channeling centuries gone by, Switzerland\'s Williamsburg (although Old Sturbridge Village may be more like it), this outdoor museum village is adorned with 80 characteristic Swiss houses from 18 cantons. Dotting the meadows are 19th-century barns, gorgeous pastel-shuttered houses, antique lace-making shops, old Swiss haberdashers, and plenty of lovely old chalets. Most have been carefully reconstructed. Even the gardens and farm animals are true to type. Old handicrafts and trades like spinning, forging, and lace making are demonstrated using original tools, and many of the \"re-enactors\" are in period costume. The settlement—found between the villages of Hofstetten and Brienzwiler—ranges over many acres and you can easily spend a half-day here. On the other hand, it\'s not often you come across such a collection of magnificent old relics and abodes, so spend the day at what visitors have called \"the perfect family outing.\" Via public transport, train to the Brienz station and then transfer to municipal bus. www.ballenberg.ch.

Follow signs to the Top of Europe restaurant, a gleaming white glass-and-steel pavilion. The expanse of rock and ice you see from here is simply blinding.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\'re not sated with the staggering views from the Jungfraujoch terminus, you can reach yet another height by riding a high-tech 90-second elevator up 364 feet to the <b>Sphinx Terrace</b> : to the south crawls the vast Aletsch Glacier, to the northeast stand the Mönch and the Eiger, and to the southwest—almost close enough to touch—towers the tip of the Jungfrau herself. Note: even in low season you may have to wait in line for the elevator.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">More than views are offered to the hordes that mount the Jungfraujoch daily. From June to the middle of September you can sign up for a beginner\'s ski lesson or a dogsled ride, or tour the chill blue depths of the <b>Ice Palace,</b> a novelty reminiscent of a wax museum, full of incongruous and slightly soggy ice sculptures. Admission to the attraction is included in the price of the excursion.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A few things to keep in mind for the Jungfraujoch trip: take sunglasses, warm clothes, and sturdy shoes; even the interior halls can be cold and slippery at the top. Some sensitive individuals may experience fatigue or headaches while at the top from the high altitude, which usually disappears on the train ride down. Return trains, especially toward the end of the day, can be standing room only. To save money, take a guided tour with English commentary (called Jungfrau Tour, as opposed to <i>Jungfrau individuel</i>), which costs less. Tours leave once a day from Interlaken West, with stops at Interlaken East, Wilderswil, Lauterbrunnen, and Wengen before climbing to Kleine Scheidegg; the return trip is via Grindelwald. You can get to Lauterbrunnen or Grindelwald on your own steam, but you\'ll have to return the way you came and miss the full round-trip tour. COST: Round-trip Interlaken East-Lauterbrunnen-Wengen-Jungfraujoch (back via Grindelwald) 177.80 SF. OPEN: May-Oct., daily 6 AM (first train up)-5:50 PM (last train down); Nov.-Apr., daily 6 AM (first train up)-4:40 PM (last train down). The schedule is weather-dependent in winter: call ahead. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">St. Beatus-Höhlen</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lovers of Old Swiss style should consider trekking out some 8 km (5 miles) from Interlaken to take in St. Beatus-Höhlen. Whether or not you\'re into natural caverns remains to be seen, but no one could resist St. Beatus\'s extraordinary entry hillside pavilion: a Hansel-and-Gretelesque extravaganza of 19th-century Alpine Gemütlichkeit, replete with dollhouse-issue waterfall. Beauty is not just skin deep, however, for the deep St. Beatus caves are marvels, too. Their legend goes back to the 6th century, when the missionary St. Beatus arrived on the Thunersee to find the local population terrorized by a dragon who lived in the lake and surrounding grottoes. Exorcised by Beatus, the fleeing dragon fell to his death on the rocks plunging down to the lake. The caves then became the hermit\'s home; today you can see the stalagmites, stalactites, and pools inside. There\'s even a replica of Ponzo, the dragon, for children to explore, and a Ponzo-decorated steamship plies the Thunersee. You can reach the caves by taking Bus 21 from the Interlaken West train station or by crossing by boat from Interlaken West station to Sundlaunen, then a quarter-hour hike to the caves. www.beatushoehlen.ch.

The oldest parts still standing date from the 15th century, though most of the castle was built in the Renaissance and baroque styles of the 16th and 17th centuries, when the castle was the seat of the Palatinate electors. There\'s even an \"English wing,\" built in 1612 by the elector Friedrich V for his teenage Scottish bride, Elizabeth Stuart; its plain, square-window facade is positively foreign compared to the more opulent styles of the castle. (The enamored Friedrich also had a charming garden laid out for his young bride; its imposing arched entryway, the Elisabethentor, was put up overnight as a surprise for her 19th birthday.) The architectural highlight remains the Renaissance courtyard—harmonious, graceful, and ornate.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The castle includes the <b>Deutsches Apotheken-Museum</b> (German Apothecary Museum. tel. 06221/25880.

It was used to hold wines paid as taxes by wine growers in the Palatinate.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The castle may be reached by taking the Königstuhl Bergbahn. Generations of earlier visitors hiked up to it on the Burgweg, a winding road. Of course, it\'s easier to walk down. In summer there are fireworks displays from the castle terrace (on the first Saturday in June and September and the second Saturday in July).

You can also go Nessie-watching on Loch Ness or hire a small boat and travel the Caledonian Canal.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cairngorms National Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Britain\'s newest national park is also its largest, covering nearly 1,400 square mi of countryside. At its heart is a wild arctic landscape that sits on a granite plateau. Five of Scotland\'s nine 4,000-feet-high mountains are found in this range, and there are 13 more over 3,000 feet. These rounded mountains, including Cairn Gorm (meaning \"blue hill\" in Gaelic) and Ben Macdui, the second highest in Britain at 4,295 feet, were formed at the end of the last ice age. The Larig Ghru Pass, a stunning U-shape glen, was formed by the retreating glacier.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hikers, underestimate this landscape at your peril: the fierce conditions often found on the Cairngorms plateau have claimed many lives. If you venture out into it, make sure you are well-prepared and have informed someone of your planned route and estimated return time.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The environment supports rare arctic-alpine and tundra plant and animal species (a quarter of Britain\'s threatened species) including flora such as the least willow and alpine blue-sow thistle, and birds such as the ptarmigan, Scottish crossbill, and dotterel. Lower down the slopes, terrain that was once filled with woodland is now characterized by heather, cotton grass, and sphagnum moss. This open expanse allows visitors to glimpse wild animals such as the golden eagle, roe deer, or red deer.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fragments of the ancient Caledonian forest (largely Scots pine, birch, and rowan) remain and are home to pine martins, red squirrels, and capercaillie (a large grouse). Studding these forests are dramatic glens and the rivers Spey, Don, and Dee, which are home to Atlantic salmon, otters, and freshwater pearl mussels.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bonnie Prince Charlie</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">His life became the stuff of legends. Charles Edward Louis John Casimir Silvester Maria Stuart, better known as Bonnie Prince Charlie or the Young Pretender, was born in Rome in 1720. The grandson of ousted King James II of England, Scotland, and Ireland (King James VII of Scotland) and son of James Stuart, the Old Pretender, he was the focus of Jacobite hopes to reclaim the throne of Scotland. Charles was charming and attractive, and he enjoyed more than the occasional drink.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1745 Charles led a Scottish uprising to restore his father to the throne. He sailed to the Outer Hebrides with only a few men but with promised support from France. When that support failed to arrive, he sought help from the Jacobite supporters, many from the Highland clans, who were faithful to his family. With 6,000 men behind him, Charles saw victory in Prestonpans and Falkirk, but the tide turned when he lied to his men about additional Jacobite troops waiting south of the border. When these fictitious troops did not materialize, his army retreated to Culloden where, on the April 16, 1746, they were massacred.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Charles escaped to the Isle of Benbecula where he met and is rumored to have fallen in love with Flora MacDonald. After he had hidden there for a week, Flora dressed him as her maid and brought him to sympathizers on the Isle of Skye. They helped him escape to France.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Scotland endured harsh reprisals from the government after the rebellion. As for Charles, he spent the rest of his life in drunken exile, taking the title count of Albany. In 1772 he married Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern, only to separate from her eight years later. He died a broken man in Rome in 1788.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">—by Fiona G.

Also in Jackson Hole is the small but bustling town of Jackson, with its one-of-a-kind town square entered through elk antler arches and a stagecoach that gives rides throughout the day in summer.

In its heyday, by various accounts, before the gold thinned out in the 1870s, there were between 1,500 and 4,000 residents. After Sioux and Cheyenne raids, over settlers hunting indigenous game herds and miners poisoning their drinking water, the town still boomed until going bust and dropping to double digits by 1872. Its well-preserved remains are now the South Pass City State Historic Site. You can tour many of the original surviving buildings that have been restored, and you can even try your hand at gold panning. With artifacts and photographs of the town at its peak, the small museum here gives an overview of the South Pass gold district.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">South Pass City has another claim to fame. Julia Bright and Esther Hobart Morris are two of the women from the community who firmly believed that women should have the right to vote. It is suspected that they encouraged Bright\'s husband, Representative William Bright, to introduce a bill for women\'s suffrage in the Wyoming Territorial Legislature. He did so, the bill was ratified, and South Pass went down in history as the birthplace of women\'s suffrage in Wyoming. In 1870 Morris became the first female justice of the peace in the nation, serving South Pass City. wyoparks.state.wy.us/index.asp. COST: $2.

But from around late November through March, the real highlight is the more than 7,500 elk, many with enormous antler racks, that winter here. There are also buffalo, and limited hunts, depending on population size, to cull the herds. The Refuge Road entrance lies about 1 mi from the Town Square just past St. John\'s hospital on East Broadway. Elk can also be observed from various pullouts along U.S. 191 or up close by slowly driving your car on the refuge\'s winding unpaved roads. There\'s also a horse-drawn sleigh ride, giving visitors the chance to see the elk stand or eat calmly as sleighs loaded with families and supplied with alfalfa pellets move in their midst. Among the other animals that make their home here are buffalo, coyote, mountain sheep, trumpeter swan, and other waterfowl. Arrange for sleigh rides through the Jackson Hole &amp; Greater Yellowstone Visitor Center at 532 N.

Most resort areas are at sea level, with average afternoon temperatures of 75°F to 80°F during the coldest months of December and January; during the hottest months of August and September the temperature often reaches 90°F. Higher \"Upcountry\" elevations have cooler and often misty conditions. Only at mountain summits does it reach freezing.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Moist trade winds drop their precipitation on the north and east sides of all the islands, creating tropical climates, whereas the south and west sides remain hot and dry with desertlike conditions. Rainfall can be high in winter, particularly on those north and east shores.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many travelers head to the islands in winter, especially during Christmas and spring break. This means that fewer travel bargains are available; room rates average 10% to 15% higher during these times than the rest of the year.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Typically the weather on Maui is drier in summer (more guaranteed beach days) and rainier in winter (greener foliage, better waterfalls). Throughout the year, West Maui and the South Shore (the leeward areas) are the driest, sunniest areas on the island—that\'s why the resorts are in those areas. The North Shore and East Maui and Hana (the windward areas) get the most rain, are densely forested, and abound with waterfalls and rainbows.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Climate</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The following are average maximum and minimum temperatures for Lahaina; the temperatures throughout the Hawaiian Islands are similar.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Only in Hawaii Holidays</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hawaiians appreciate any occasion to celebrate; not only are indigenous Hawaiian holidays honored, so are those of the state\'s early immigrant cultures. If you happen to be in the Islands on March 26 or June 11, you\'ll notice light traffic and busy beaches—these are state holidays. March 26 recognizes the birthday of Prince Jonah Kuhio Kalanianaole, a member of the royal line who served as a delegate to Congress and spearheaded the effort to set aside homelands for Hawaiian people. June 11 honors the first island-wide monarch, Kamehameha I; locals drape his statues with lei and stage elaborate parades. May 1 isn\'t an official holiday, but it\'s the day when schools and civic groups celebrate the flower lei with lei-making contests and pageants. Statehood Day is celebrated on the third Friday in August (Admission Day was August 21, 1959). Most Japanese and Chinese holidays are widely observed. On Chinese New Year, in winter, homes and businesses sprout red good-luck mottoes, lions dance in the streets, and everybody eats <i>gau</i> (steamed pudding) and <i>jai</i> (vegetarian stew). Good Friday is a state holiday in spring, a favorite for picnics. Summertime is for Obon festivals and the July 4 Rodeo; the Maui County Fair and Aloha Festivals are in fall.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Great Itineraries</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Maui\'s landscape is incredibly diverse, offering everything from underwater encounters with eagle rays to treks across moonlike terrain. Although daydreaming at the pool or on the beach may fulfill your initial island fantasy, Maui has much more to offer. The following one-day itineraries will take you to our favorite spots on the island.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beach Day in West Maui</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">West Maui has some of the island\'s most beautiful beaches, though many of them are hidden by megaresorts. If you get an early start, you can begin your day snorkeling at Slaughterhouse Beach (in winter, D. T. Fleming Beach is a better option as it\'s less rough). Then spend the day beach-hopping through Kapalua, Napili, and Kaanapali as you make your way south. You\'ll want to get to Lahaina before dark so you can spend some time exploring the historic whaling town before choosing a restaurant for a sunset dinner.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Focus on Marine Life on the South Shore</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Start your South Shore trip early in the morning, and head out past Makena into the rough lava fields of rugged La Pérouse Bay. At the road\'s end, the Ahihi-Kinau Marine Preserve has no beach, but it\'s a rich spot for snorkeling and getting to know Maui\'s spectacular underwater world. Head back north to Kihei for lunch, then enjoy the afternoon learning more about Maui\'s marine life at the Maui Ocean Center at Maalaea.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Haleakala National Park, Upcountry &amp; the North Shore</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you don\'t plan to spend an entire day hiking in the crater at Haleakala National Park, this itinerary will at least allow you to take a peek at it. Get up early and head straight for the summit of Haleakala (if you\'re jet-lagged and waking up in the middle of the night, you may want to get there in time for sunrise). Bring water, sunscreen, and warm clothing; it\'s freezing at sunrise. Plan to spend a couple of hours exploring the various lookout points in the park. On your way down the mountain, turn right on Makawao Avenue, and head into the little town of Makawao. You can have lunch here, or make a left on Baldwin Avenue and head downhill to the North Shore town of Paia, which has a number of great lunch spots and shops to explore. Spend the rest of your afternoon at Paia\'s main strip of sand, Hookipa Beach.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Road to Hana</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This cliff-side driving tour through rain-forest canopy reveals Maui\'s most lush and tropical terrain. It will take a full day to explore this part of the North Shore and East Maui, especially if you plan to make it all the way to Oheo Gulch. You\'ll pass through communities where old Hawaii still thrives, and where the forest runs unchecked from the sea to the summit. You\'ll want to make frequent exploratory stops. To really soak in the magic of this place, consider staying overnight in Hana town. That way you can spend a full day winding toward Hana, hiking and exploring along the way, and the next day traveling leisurely back to civilization.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><i>For more details on any of the destinations mentioned in these itineraries, see chapter 2, Exploring Maui.</i></div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Yosemite it\'s not, but it is a lovely deep valley with the curious <b>Iao Needle,</b> a spire that rises more than 2,000 feet from the valley floor. You can take one of several easy hikes from the parking lot across Iao Stream and explore the thick, junglelike topography. This park has a beautiful network of well-maintained walks, where you can stop and meditate by the edge of a stream or marvel at the native plants and flowers. Locals come to jump from the rocks or bridge into the stream—this isn\'t recommended. Mist often rises if there has been a rain, which makes being here even more magical. COST: Free. OPEN: Daily 7-7. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Makena Beach State Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although it\'s commonly known as \"Big Beach,\" its correct name is Oneloa (\"long sand\"), and that\'s exactly what it is—a huge stretch of heavenly golden sand without a house or hotel in sight. More than a decade ago, Maui citizens campaigned successfully to preserve this beloved beach from development. It\'s still wild, lacking in modern amenities (such as plumbing) but frequented by dolphins and turtles; sunsets are glorious. At the end of the beach farthest from Wailea, skim-boarders catch air. On the opposite end rises the beautiful hill called Puu Olai, a perfect cinder cone. A climb over the steep rocks at this end leads to \"Little Beach,\" which, although technically it\'s illegal, is clothing-optional. On Sunday, it\'s a mecca for drummers and island gypsies. On any day of the week watch out for the mean shore break—those crisp, aquamarine waves are responsible for more than one broken arm. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hookipa Beach</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There\'s no better place on this or any other island to watch the world\'s finest windsurfers in action. The surfers know the five different surf breaks here by name. Unless it\'s a rare day without wind or waves, you\'re sure to get a show. It\'s not safe to park on the shoulder. Use the ample parking lot at the county park entrance. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Napili Beach</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Surrounded by sleepy condos, this round bay is a turtle-filled pool lined with a sparkling white crescent of sand. Sunbathers love this beach, which is also a terrific sunset spot. The shore break is steep but gentle, so it\'s great for boogie boarding and bodysurfing. It\'s easy to keep an eye on kids here as the entire bay is visible from any point in the water. The beach is right outside the Napili Kai Beach Club, a popular little resort for honeymooners, only a few miles south of Kapalua. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Makena (Big Beach)</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Locals successfully fought to give Makena—one of Hawaii\'s most breathtaking beaches—state-park protection. It\'s often mistakenly referred to as \"Big Beach,\" but natives prefer its Hawaiian name, Oneloa. This stretch of deep-golden sand abutting sparkling aqua water is 3,000-feet-long and 100-feet-wide. It\'s never crowded, no matter how many cars cram into the lots. The water is fine for swimming, but use caution. The shore drop-off is steep and swells can get deceptively big. Despite the infamous \"Makena cloud,\" a blanket that rolls in during the early afternoon and obscures the sun, it rarely rains here. For a dramatic view of the beach, climb Puu Olai, the steep cinder cone near the first entrance. Continue over the cinder cone\'s side to discover \"Little Beach\"—clothing-optional by popular practice, although technically illegal. On Sunday, free spirits of all kinds crowd Little Beach\'s tiny shoreline for a drumming circle and bonfire. Little Beach has the island\'s best bodysurfing (no pun intended). Skim-boarders catch air at Makena\'s third entrance. Each of the three paved entrances has portable toilets. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

On Day 5, leave Ogunquit, and continue on U.S. 1 into <b>Wells,</b> a town known for its 7-mi stretch of pristine beaches. There are several opportunities for bird- and nature-watchers at Beach Plum Farm as well as the Wells Reserve and the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge. Follow scenic Route 9 to the Kennebunks, a good place to spend the night. If you have more time, visit historic homes and museums, as well as the shops in <b>Kennebunkport</b> \'s busy Dock Square, or, if you like the sights and sounds of a carnival-on-the-beach atmosphere, take coastal Route 9 north from the Kennebunks to <b>Old Orchard Beach.</b></div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">All About Lobsters</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Judging from the current price of a lobster dinner, it\'s hard to believe that lobsters were once so plentiful that servants in rich households would have contracts stating they could be served lobster \"no more than two times a week.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The going price for lobsters in the 1840s was three cents per lobster—not per pound, per lobster. Today, Maine is nearly synonymous with lobsters, the fishery being one of Maine\'s primary industries. Well over 60 million pounds of lobster are landed a year in the state, making Maine, by far, the biggest supplier in the nation.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Because of the size restrictions, most of the lobsters you find in restaurants weigh 1¼ to 1½ pounds. However, lobsters can actually grow much larger and live to a ripe old age. The largest lobster ever caught off the coast of Maine weighed in at nearly 45 pounds and was more than 50 years old!</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For an authentic, Maine-style lobster dinner, you must go to a lobster pound. Finding one should not be difficult. Generally, these places are rustic and simple—they look more like fish-packing plants than restaurants. Hundreds of freshly caught lobsters of varying sizes are kept in pens, waiting for customers. Service is simple in the extreme. You usually sit at a wooden picnic table, and eat off a thick paper plate. A classic \"Downeast\" feast includes lobster—boiled or steamed—with clam chowder, steamers, potato, and corn on the cob—and, of course, a large bib tied around your neck.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Maine\'s Beloved Sarah Orne Jewett</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">\"Tact is, after all, a kind of mind reading.\"-Sarah Orne Jewett</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Maine has had its share of famous authors, resident and visiting, who have heralded both the natural and the physical spirit of the state itself in their literary works. Horror guru Stephen King makes his home in Bangor; Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote <i>Uncle Tom\'s Cabin</i> while living in Brunswick; and poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow grew up in Portland. But few are as endearingly held among Maine\'s literary greats as Sarah Orne Jewett, born the daughter of a country doctor and his wife in South Berwick in 1849.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sarah Orne Jewett grew up privileged yet not out of reach of those within the rural farming community of 19th-century Maine; often she accompanied her father on house calls throughout the area, and many accredit her skills of quiet observation and sensitivity to these trips in the doctor\'s horse and buggy. Known for her sketches of rural life, Jewett is seen as a true daughter of Maine in the way that she beautifully and lovingly portrayed the intimate and poignant moments of her fellow citizens. Most famous are her novels <i>The Country Doctor</i> (1884) and <i>The Country of Pointed Firs</i> (1896), though she published dozens of short stories and poems throughout her writing career. Nowhere else in literature are there more endearing portraits of small-town life as in <i>The Country of Pointed Firs</i>; within her words you can nearly smell the sea air as it mingles with the scent of pines and clearly visualize the colorful characters that make up the pages within her stories.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After she published her novel <i>The Tory Lover</i> (1901), based on the wealthy Hamilton family who lived in nearby South Berwick, a review in the <i>Lewiston Journal</i> magazine section from that year summed up her writing skills aptly: \"So strong and true are the pictures drawn of life... they come to Maine readers with a sort of familiarity, born of the tales of those troublous times handed down from their forefathers. Her readers feel a nearness to these men and women which makes them forget that more than a century separates them.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Jewett never married though she had a long and loving friendship with the widow Annie Fields, with whom she spent many years traveling and socializing with other literary greats of the day, including Willa Cather, William Dean Howells, Henry James, Rudyard Kipling, and Harriet Beecher Stowe. A serious carriage accident in 1902 precipitated the end of her writing career and her eventual death in 1909. Sarah Orne Jewett\'s writing remains as a picture of the quintessential Maine known in the hearts and minds of Maine residents, both past and present.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

In 1898 Mrs. Emily Tyson and her stepdaughter purchased the home and, with the help of their friend Sarah Orne Jewett, resurrected and decorated the place in a combination of Colonial and Victorian styles. If touring the innards of old homes doesn\'t interest you, come here to explore the grounds; they\'re simply spectacular. Beautifully kept gardens look out over the tidal Salmon Falls river below, where first owner Hamilton built ships, filled them with goods, and sailed straight to England from his front yard. The Embargo Act of 1807 ended his trade and, hence, his fortune quite abruptly. Picnickers and hikers are welcome on the grounds, year-round from dawn to dusk, free of charge.

Even in summer, there are fantastic opportunities to escape the crowds.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Mucking around in boats:</b> There\'s nowhere better for renting a small boat or taking a cruise on a vintage boat and discovering the pleasures of bobbing around on the water. You\'ll get a different perspective on the mountains, too. The Coniston Boating Centre and Derwentwater Marina near Keswick are possible places to start.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Wordsworth\'s daffodils and literary landscapes:</b> The Lake District has a rich literary history, in the children\'s books of Beatrix Potter such as <i>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</i>, in the writings of John Ruskin, and in the poems of Wordsworth, which resonate more deeply after you\'ve seen his flowers dancing in the breeze. A stop at any of the writers\' homes will enrich the experience.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Pints and pubs:</b> Cumbria has some great microbreweries, and a pint of real ale in one of the region\'s atmospheric rural inns may never taste as good as after a long hard day up a mountain.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Sunrise at Castlerigg:</b> The stone circle at Castlerigg, in a natural hollow ringed by peaks, is a reminder of the region\'s ancient history. Blencathra and other mountains provide an awesome backdrop for the 38 stones. Sunrise is magical.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Poetry, Prose, and the Lakes</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Lake District\'s beauty has whetted the creativity of many a famous poet and artist over the centuries. Here\'s a quick rundown of some of the writers inspired by the area\'s vistas.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>William Wordsworth</b> (1770-1850), one of the first English Romantics, redefined poetry by replacing the mannered style of his predecessors with a more conversational style. Many of his greatest works, such as <i>The Prelude,</i> draw directly from his experiences in the Lake District, where he spent the first 20 and last 50 years of his life. Wordsworth and his work had an enormous effect on Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Byron, and countless other writers.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>John Ruskin</b> (1819-1900), writer, art critic, and early conservationist, was an impassioned champion of new ways of seeing. He defended contemporary artists such as William Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites. His five-volume masterwork, <i>Modern Painters,</i> changed the role of the art critic from that of approver or naysayer to that of interpreter.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Thomas De Quincey</b> (1785-1859) wrote essays whose impressionistic style influenced many 19th-century writers, including Poe and Baudelaire. His most famous work, <i>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater</i> (1822), is an imaginative memoir of his young life, which indeed included opium addiction. He settled in Grasmere in 1809.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Beatrix Potter</b> (1866-1943) never had a formal education; instead, she spent her childhood studying nature. Her love of the outdoors, and Lakeland scenery in particular, influenced her delightfully illustrated children\'s books, including <i>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</i> and <i>The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck</i>. Potter also became a noted conservationist who donated land to the National Trust. The story of her life was made into the 2006 film <i>Miss Potter,</i> starring Renée Zellweger and Ewan McGregor.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Festivals and Folk Sports</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With everything from rushbearing to Westmorland wrestling to traditional music, the Lake District hosts some of Britain\'s most unusual country festivals as well as some excellent but more typical ones. Major festivals include the Keswick Film Festival (February), Words by the Water (a literary festival in Keswick, February-March), Keswick Jazz Festival (May), Cockermouth and Keswick carnivals (June), Ambleside rushbearing (August) and sports (July), Grasmere rushbearing (August) and sports (August), and Lake District Summer Music (regionwide, in August), but some sort of event or festival happens somewhere during most weeks throughout the year.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Rushbearing dates back to medieval times, when rushes covered church floors; today processions of flower-bedecked children and adults bring rushes to churches in a number of villages. Folk sports, often the highlights at local festivals, include Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling, in which the opponents must maintain a grip around each other\'s body. Fell running, a sort of cross-country run where the route goes roughly straight up and down a mountain, is also popular.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A calendar of events is available at tourist information centers or on the Cumbria Tourism Web site, www.golakes.co.uk.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

With five ski resorts ringing the mountains—A-Basin, Breck, Cooper, Copper, and Keystone—Summit County is a skier\'s and rider\'s Valhalla with everything from the easy beginner glades at Copper to backcountry cat skiing at Keystone.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Leadville:</b> It was gold that built Colorado in the 1800s, and this legacy is alive and well in the rejuvenated mining town of Leadville. Walk the small downtown of our country\'s highest city—a breath-sapping 10,430 feet—and visit some of the local museums like the National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Lake Dillon:</b> Nothing beats a day of lake kayaking or fishing among the many wooded islets on Lake Dillon, the reservoir that is the heart of Summit County.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Party Towns:</b> If you\'re looking for a reason to party surrounded by white-capped mountains, Breckenridge hosts numerous festivals including the aptly named Spring Massive Festival in April, and the weeklong Ullr Festival in January.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Trail Biking:</b> Sure, there are plenty of beautiful single tracks for mountain bikers, but the real draw in Summit County is the glorious paved bike trail that runs from Dillon all the way up and over Vail Pass down into that ski town. Bring your helmet and your wallet—you can stop off for refreshments at Copper Mountain Resort.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Golf</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It isn\'t easy to define \"golf\" in Colorado because the topography varies so dramatically, from the rolling plains near the Kansas state line to the flat-top buttes and mesas at the western end of the state. In the Rockies, the state\'s central spine, the courses climb up and down mountainsides; in the foothills the fairways roll over more-gentle terrain and over canyons; and down in the cities many layouts march back and forth in confined spaces.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mountain golf has unique challenges, but vacationers flock to the high-country golf courses because of their dramatic scenery. \"Aim for that peak\" is an oft-repeated phrase. It doesn\'t matter whether you are playing the Jack Nicklaus-designed 27-hole municipal course in Breckenridge, the Club at Crested Butte, or the golf course at the Snowmass Club, there\'s bound to be a hole where that description fits.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Resort courses, available to guests staying at certain lodgings, are spread around mountain towns from Snowmass and Steamboat to Vail and Telluride. For example, guests staying at certain properties in Vail and Beaver Creek get access to the Tom Fazio course (woven through sagebrush-covered hills) and the Greg Norman course (spread around a broad valley with shots across ravines) at the posh, private Red Sky Golf Club in Edwards, 15 minutes west of Beaver Creek. Even if you\'re not staying in a hotel that has preferred tee times at specific resort courses, a good concierge (or your own Web search) will obtain tee times at many entertaining courses, such as the Raven at Three Peaks in Summit County and Sheraton Steamboat Golf Club in Steamboat.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When playing high-altitude golf, you do have to deal with mountain lies and illusions. The thrill of a clean hit and watching the ball fly 300 yards downhill may be deflected by the agony of seeing a putt topple off the back edge of a green because you \"knew\" that the green tilted left, although it actually sloped right. Low-land golfers who come to the mountains to play golf quickly learn they may have to change club lengths and lofts, because balls fly 10%-15% farther in the thinner air and land on never-level terrain. Greens are especially difficult to read, because the ball will try to roll from the highest mountain peak to the nearest valley—unless the course architect foxes players by building up the green\'s lower end to counterbalance that pull. Ask the pro in the golf shop for tips before setting out.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you aren\'t heading up to the mountains, there are plenty of public and semiprivate courses in and around the bigger cities. Some city-owned courses in Denver proper tend to be unimaginative layouts in confined spaces, but there\'s a variety of challenging and award-winning courses in the surrounding burbs, especially in Lakewood, Littleton, and Parker.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the western slopes, a big standout is the Golf Club at Redland Mesa in Grand Junction. This award-winning Jim Engh public course is woven among mesas and sand-color flat-top buttes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Here in Colorado there\'s an array of golf courses designed to offer you entertaining challenges in a spectacular setting.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">—Lois Friedland</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Timing</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Summit County is a haven for winter enthusiasts: The resorts of Arapahoe Basin and Breckenridge—and nearby Loveland in Clear Creek County—are so high that the ski season often dawns here weeks before it does in the rest of the state, with Arapahoe Basin and Loveland competing to see who has the longest season. The altitude also means that it can snow on any day of the year, so be prepared. Traffic, particularly on the I-70 approaches to the Eisenhower Tunnel and the Georgetown-to-Idaho Springs stretch, moves at a snail\'s pace around weekend rush hours—3 to 10 PM on Friday and all day Sunday.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Colorado\'s Fragile Wilderness</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">More than 1,500 peaks pierce the Colorado skyline, creating one of the most extensive and pristine alpine landscapes in the United States. It is a treeless landscape that has changed little in thousands of years; summer storms bury prehistoric glaciers, colorful wildflowers push up through snowy meadows, and ice-covered mountains fill 100-mi views.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">But time is catching up with this ice-age wilderness. The very characteristics that once preserved the panoramic heights from human impact—rugged peaks, polar weather, barren vistas—are the same ones that today threaten it. Growing environmental pressures from recreational use, industrial pollution, and changing land-use patterns are taking a toll on this surprisingly fragile ecosystem.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Colorado\'s burgeoning population is increasing at an annual rate of 3%, a rate not seen since the gold-rush days of 1859. Many who move to the Mile High State enjoy an outdoor lifestyle that includes hiking. A popular pastime for many has been tackling the Fourteeners, the state\'s 54 peaks that top 14,000 feet. As more and more hikers trample up these mountains, they gouge new trails, compact thin soil, and crush root systems. This damage can take a surprisingly long time to heal. Trails across the tundra near Rocky Mountain National Park that were carved out by Ute and Arapaho scouts hundreds of years ago are still visible today.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Less subtle than erosion, and equally devastating, is the harm caused by industrial pollution. Western Slope power plants in Craig and Hayden burn low-sulfur coal. Scientists believe the resulting sulfur and nitrogen emissions may be creating acid snow in the alpine watersheds, the same watersheds that pour forth several of the great American rivers, including the Colorado, Rio Grande, and Arkansas.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ironically one of the greatest threats to the alpine tundra comes from attempts at preserving native wildlife. With wolves and grizzlies extinct in Colorado and hunting banned in Rocky Mountain National Park, the elk population has exploded from a handful of over-hunted animals to more than 2,500. Their sharp hooves trample summer pastures above the timberline and destroy many of the arctic willow stands that provide food and shelter for other wildlife, including the white-tailed ptarmigan.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Despite tales told to the tourists who admire its raw beauty in record numbers, Colorado\'s alpine wilderness is not the land that time forgot. In an amazing wilderness that has been around for more than 100 centuries, the clock is still ticking.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">—Jad Davenport</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The lake is actually a 231-foot earth-filled dam that fills the valley where Dillon once sat. During the frequent western droughts, when water levels can drop dramatically, collectors wander along the exposed shores hunting for artifacts from this Rocky Mountain Atlantis.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It was these droughts that inspired the Denver Water Board to construct the reservoir and divert the water through the Harold D. Roberts Tunnel, beneath the Continental Divide. Below the mile-long dam the Blue River babbles past the outlet shopping haven and turns into miles of gold-medal fly-fishing waters on its journey north.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The lake has been an aquatic boon to both the Front Range and the exploding Summit County population. There are more than 27 mi of gravel beaches, marshes, peninsulas, and wooded islets for picnickers to enjoy, many accessible from a 7.5-mi paved trail along the northern shores, or from the informal dirt paths elsewhere. Gaze out at the deep blue waters from Sapphire Point Lookout (a short ½-mi hike on the south side of the lake) any nice day and you\'ll see a flotilla of motorboats, sailboats, canoes, kayaks, and sailboarders dancing in the waves. In winter the frozen waters are enjoyed by ice anglers and cross-country skiers.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Because the lake is considered a drinking-water source, swimming is not permitted and the lake is patrolled vigorously by Summit County sheriffs. Just because you don\'t see a patrol boat doesn\'t mean they can\'t see you; their surveillance is done with binoculars. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Your first glimpse of the fabled city from the Funeral Rock will be your own discovery, and every bit as exciting.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Trail: The four-day hike of the Inca Trail from near Ollantaytambo to Machu Picchu is Peru\'s best-known outdoor expedition. Spaces fill up quickly, but never fear: tour operators have opened up some alternative treks.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Ye Olde Technology: It was the 15th century, yet the Inca made the stones fit perfectly without mortar. The sun illuminates the windows perfectly at the solstice, and the crops grow in an inhospitable climate. And they did it all without bulldozers, tractors, and Google Earth.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mystery: Mystics, shamans, spiritualists, astrologers, and UFO spotters, professionals and wannabes, flock to this serene region. Even the most no-nonsense curmudgeons find themselves contemplating history\'s secrets.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Train To Machu Picchu</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At least two PeruRail trains depart from Cusco\'s San Pedro station daily for Aguas Calientes, near Machu Picchu. The Vistadome leaves at 6 AM and arrives in Aguas Calientes at 9:40. It returns from Aguas Calientes at 3:30 PM, arriving in Cusco at 7:25. A second Vistadome service departs at 6:15 AM. The round-trip fare is S/429. Snacks and beverages are included in the price, and the cars have sky domes for great views. The return trip includes a fashion show and folklore dancing.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Backpacker train leaves Cusco at 7 AM, arriving in Aguas Calientes at 10:40. It leaves Aguas Calientes at 5 PM, getting back to Cusco at 9:25. The round-trip fare is S/290. Conditions are comparable to second-class trains in Western Europe and are quite comfortable.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A second Vistadome or Backpacker train may be added during the June-August high season, depending on demand.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">All trains make an exaggerated series of five zigzag switchbacks, climbing as they leave from Cusco before descending into the lower-altitude Sacred Valley. Trains stop at Poroy, Ollantaytambo, Km 88 (the start of the Inca Trail), and Km 104 (the launch point of an abbreviated two-day Inca Trail). Arrival is in Aguas Calientes, where you catch the buses up to the ruins.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The return trip takes longer, but you can disembark in Poroy, about 15 minutes by highway from Cusco, where an Asociación de Agencias de Turismo de Cusco bus meets every Cusco-bound train. The fare is a time-saving S/5, and the bus deposits you on Cusco\'s Plaza de Armas.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Vistadome and Backpacker trains depart from Cusco\'s San Pedro station, where, in theory, same-day tickets can be purchased but waiting that late is risky. Purchase tickets in advance from the PeruRail sales office at Cusco\'s Wanchaq Station, weekdays from 7 to 5, and weekends and Peruvian holidays from 7-noon—note that PeruRail does not accept credit cards—or from a travel agency. (Most tour packages include rail tickets as well as bus transport to and from Aguas Calientes and Machu Picchu and admission to the ruins, and lodging if you plan to stay overnight.) Also in theory, PeruRail accepts e-mail reservations through its Web site: you send them the names, passport numbers, and travel dates of all passengers—but no credit-card numbers—then take the confirmation they send you to Wanchaq Station upon your arrival in Cusco and pay for your tickets in cash. At best, that procedure is cumbersome, and we hear frequent reports of e-mails not being answered or confirmations never received.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">PeruRail\'s luxury Hiram Bingham train proffers a class of service unto itself (with prices to match). Trains depart from Poroy station, about 15 minutes outside Cusco, eliminating the tedious switchbacks necessary for the other trains to get out of and into the city. Departure time is a more leisurely 9 AM daily except Sunday, arriving at Aguas Calientes at 12:30 PM. Return service leaves Aguas Calientes at 6:30 PM, returning to Poroy at 10. The timetable permits you to stay at the ruins for a few hours after the day visitors have departed on the mid-afternoon trains back to Cusco. Trains consist of two dining cars, a bar car, and a kitchen car, and evoke the glamour of the old Orient Express rail service, no surprise, since Orient Express is the parent company of PeruRail. The S/1,775 round-trip price tag includes brunch on the trip to Machu Picchu, bus transport from Aguas Calientes up to the ruins and back in vehicles exclusively reserved for Hiram Bingham clients, admission to the ruins, guide services while there, and an afternoon buffet tea at the Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge. The trip back entails cocktails, live entertainment, and a four-course dinner.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\'re using the Sacred Valley as your base, PeruRail operates a daily Vistadome train departing from Ollantaytambo at 7 AM, with arrival in Machu Picchu at 8:20. Other trains leave Ollantaytambo at 10:30 AM and 2:55 PM, arriving at Aguas Calientes about 75 minutes later. Return trains leave Aguas Calients at 8:35 AM and 1:20 and 4:45 PM. Round-trip fare is S/362. Shuttle buses connect Ollantaytambo to Urubamba. This service can give you more time to spend at the ruins than you\'d have with a Cusco departure, or flexibility of travel at various times of day. A daily Backpacker train departs Ollantaytambo at 9:05 AM, arriving at Aguas Calientes at 11. Return from Aguas Calientes is at 4:20 PM, with arrival in Ollantaytambo at 6. Round-trip fare is S/260.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">PeruRail\'s service is generally punctual. Schedules and rates are always subject to change, and there may be fewer trains per day to choose from during the December to March low season.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tourists are not permitted to ride the Tren Local, the less expensive, but slower train intended for local residents only.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Information</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Asociación de Agencias de Turismo de Cusco</b> (Nueva Baja 424, Cusco. tel. 084/222-580). <b>PeruRail</b> (San Pedro station, Cascapara near Santa Clara, Cusco. tel. 084/233-551. www.perurail.com.

You\'ll encounter fantastic ruins almost immediately. An easy ascent takes you to the first of those, <b>Patallaqta</b> (also called llactapata). The name means \"town on a hillside\" in quechua, and the ruins are thought to have been a village in Inca times. Bingham and company camped here on their first excursion to Machu Picchu. As at most Inca sites, you\'ll see three levels of architecture representing the three spiritual worlds of the inca—the world above (a guard tower), the world we live in (the main complex), and the world below (the river and hidden aqueducts).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At the end of the day, you arrive at <b>Huayllabamba</b> (also called as wayllamba), the only inhabited village on the trail and your first overnight</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Day 2.</b> It\'s another 12-km (7½-mi) hike, but with a gain of 1,200 meters (3,940 feet) in elevation. The day is most memorable for the spectacular views and muscular aches after ascending <b>Dead Woman\'s Pass</b> (also known as warmiwañuscca) at 4,200 meters (13,780 feet). The pass is named for the silhouette created by its mountain ridges—they resemble a woman\'s head, nose, chin, and chest.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A tricky descent takes you to <b>Pacaymayu,</b> the second night\'s campsite, and you can pat yourself on the back for completing the hardest section of the Inca Trail.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Day 3.</b> Downhill! You descend to the subtropical cloud forest where the amazon basin begins. There\'s some of the most stunning mountain scenery you\'ll see during the four days. The ruins of <b>Runkuraqay</b> were a circular Inca storage depot for products transported between Machu Picchu and Cusco.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You also pass by <b>Sayacmarca</b>, possibly a way station for priests traversing the trail.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most excursions arrive by mid-afternoon at <b>Huiñay Huayna</b> (also known as</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">wiñaywayna), the third-night\'s stopping point, at what may now seem a low and balmy 2,712 meters (8,900 feet). The first possibility of a hot shower and a cold beer are here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There is time to see the ruins of <b>Puyupatamarca</b> (also known as phuyupatamarca) a beautifully restored site with ceremonial baths, and perhaps the best ruins on the hike. At this point you catch your first glimpse of Machu Picchu peak, but from the back side.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Day 4.</b> This is it. Day 4 means the grand finale, arrival at <b>Machu Picchu</b>, the reason for the trail in the first place. You\'ll be roused from your sleeping bag well before dawn to arrive at the ruins in time to catch the sunrise. You\'ll be amazed at the number of fellow travelers who forget about their aching muscles and sprint this last stretch.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The trail takes you past the <b>Intipunku,</b> the sun gate. Bask in your first sight of the ruins and your accomplishment, but you\'ll need to circle around and enter Machu Picchu officially through the entrance gate.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Although it\'s commercial and busy, <b>Alexandria Bay</b> lies in the center of the 50-mi-long area and has plenty of lodging options. Attractions include historic Boldt Castle (on Heart Island) and many opportunities to get out on the water and begin counting the islands. The state park on Wellesley Island has a beach and a 600-acre wildlife sanctuary with a museum. Kids also enjoy the Aqua Zoo. In the morning on Day 2, make the short trip to the river city of <b>Clayton</b> to see the wonderful Antique Boat Museum and have lunch in town. After eating, drive another 12 mi or so southwest along Route 12E to the Tibbetts Point Lighthouse in Cape Vincent, where Lake Ontario meets the St. Lawrence River. On Day 3, if you feel up to it, drive south to <b>Sackets Harbor</b> to stroll the battlefield where two engagements of the War of 1812 took place <i>or</i> to visit the Seaway Trail Discovery Center. In summer the harbor bustles with cruising activity. In winter the town belongs to hardy cross-country skiers and snowmobilers.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 6 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Use <b>Alexandria Bay</b> as your base for three nights.

On Day 2 venture northeast to either <b>Ogdensburg</b>, where the main draw is the Frederic Remington Art Museum, or <b>Massena</b>, to see the Moses-Saunders Power Dam and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Lock. On the morning of Day 4 make the short drive to <b>Clayton</b> and the must-see Antique Boat Museum. Stop for lunch in the city and then go on to the Tibbetts Point Lighthouse in Cape Vincent. Afterward, head south (Route 12E to Route 180 to Route 3) to <b>Sackets Harbor</b>, where you spend the fourth and fifth nights. On Day 5 stroll the Sackets Harbor Battlefield State Historic Site, visit the Seaway Trail Discovery Center, and take a self-guided walking tour of the historic district with a brochure from the visitor center.

Four years later, when she died suddenly, he ceased work on the castle. The building remained deserted for 73 years, abused by vandals and weather. Since 1977, millions of dollars have been poured into restoration work. It\'s worth a trip to the 5-acre island to see the castle.

You can even experience a <i>temazcal,</i> an adobe sweat lodge used by the indigenous people. Facilities in nearby villages, such as San Antonio Cuajimoloyas, have a similar range of activities.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Volunteers at the <b>Tourist Yu\'u Project</b> (Calle Murguía 204, at Calle 5 de Mayo, Centro Histórico. tel. 951/516-0123), in the state tourism office, will show you a book with photos of each of the lodgings and give you fact sheets printed in English. They can also make reservations for you. The staff will steer you toward more comfortable facilities unless you specifically request more rustic digs.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mezcal\'s Mysteries</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are two big myths about mezcal, the distilled pride of Oaxaca. The first is that a mezcal bottle contains a worm. (This is true only of the low-grade, mass-produced mezcals, which use the worm as a marketing gimmick.) A second myth is that mezcal is a less-refined version of tequila. Quite the contrary: while tequila is only distilled from the blue agave plant, cooked in steam chambers, and generally made in industrial-sized batches, mezcal is made from dozens of varieties of agave, roasted over a wood fire in a traditional earth pit, distilled, and usually made in small quantities by small producers. The result is a soft, smoky, and complex liquor—one meant to be slowly sipped and savored. Mezcal is an elixir whose renown has been impeded only by the industry\'s almost comical disorganization and lack of marketing savvy.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To further complicate things, a 2005 law passed by the Mexican government imposed a set of standards on mezcal production for the first time, including the certification process aimed at controlling quality. The law\'s intent was to weed out the imposters that mixed their product with cane alcohol, but the side effect of the new bureaucratic requirements has been to impose considerable new costs on producers, reducing quantities, and raising prices. That said, you now know just what you\'re getting when you see a certified <i>reposado</i> (aged 2 months-1 year in oak barrels), <i>añejo</i> (aged 1-3 years), and <i>extrañejo</i> (aged more than 3 years). Some are aged even more than that, like the 10-year-old Joya, which you find at stores in the region.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Viva La Fiesta</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">No matter what the holiday, Oaxaca pulls out all the stops. First and foremost is Guelaguetza, the annual celebration of the state\'s traditional music and dance, usually held on the last two Mondays in July. It draws delegations of traditional dancers from throughout the region. On these two days people climb up the Cerro del Fortín (Hill of the Fort) to the auditorium built especially to hold the overflow crowds that turn out for the event. Try to see the Danza de las Plumas (Dance of the Feathers), which tells the story of the Spanish conquest.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) officially begins on October 31, the eve of All Saints\' Day, when both city dwellers and country folk decorate altars for deceased family members. Tradition dictates that they also visit the cemetery with flowers, candles, and the deceased\'s favorite food and drink. The most frequently visited graveyard is that of Xoxocotlan, a village near Oaxaca City; Atzompa and Xochimilco, and other nearby villages, also have colorful celebrations.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">December is full of fiestas, including those for Mexico\'s patron saint, the Virgen de Guadalupe (December 12), and Oaxaca\'s patron saint, the Virgen de la Soledad (December 8). The Noche de Rábanos (Night of the Radishes) is on December 23. During this celebration, Oaxaca City\'s main square is packed with growers and artists displaying their hybrid carved radishes, <i>flores inmortales</i> (small, dried \"eternal flowers\"), and <i>totomoxtl</i> (corn husks, pronounced to-to-<i>mosh</i>-tl)—all arranged in interesting tableaux. December 24 is the Noche de Calendas, in which locals demonstrate their devotion to the Virgin Mary by bearing heavy baskets of flowers from church to church.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The interior of the dome is adorned with more than 100 medallions depicting various martyrs. Make sure to look up at the ceiling just inside the front door to see an elaborately gilded rendering of the family tree of Santo Domingo. OPEN: Mon.-Sat. 7-1 and 4-7:30, Sun. 7-1 and 4-7. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Museo de las Culturas</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This gorgeous museum is laid out in a series of galleries around the cloister of the labyrinthine Ex-Convento de Santo Domingo. On the ground floor are temporary exhibits and a collection of antique books. On the second floor you\'ll find rooms dedicated to Oaxacan music, medicine, indigenous languages, and pottery. More than a dozen other salons have been organized chronologically. Here you\'ll find such Monte Albán treasures as the stunning gold jewelry from Tomb 7—among the greatest archaeological finds of all time. Signage is in Spanish only, but English-language audio tours are available. Several lovely second-floor balconies have views of the botanical garden. www.inah.gob.mx. COST: $5.10. OPEN: Tues.-Sun. 10-8, last entrance at 6:15. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Playa Carrizalillo</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In a region full of beautiful beaches, Playa Carrizalillo can still take your breath away. The high cliffs that surround it ensure that it\'s never too crowded. The aquamarine water here is clean, clear, and shallow—perfect for swimming and snorkeling, especially around the rocks that frame the beautiful cove. Sometimes there are waves large enough to be appropriate for beginning surfers. A handful of palm-thatched restaurants rent snorkeling equipment and serve food and drinks. It\'s a two-minute drive or 35-minute walk from the center of town; a small sign indicates where to turn onto the unpaved road. It\'s about 150 steps down from the parking area, but the steep stone staircase is well maintained. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

They were among the richest people in America at the time—from railroad tycoons and coal barons to plantation owners.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The era during which they lived here, the late 1800s up through the 1920s, is often referred to as the Gilded Age, a term coined by Mark Twain and co-author Charles Dudley Warner in a book by the same name. It was a time when whom you knew was everything. Three übersocialites were Alva Vanderbilt Belmont, Mary Ann (Mamie) Fish, and Tessie Oelrichs. These ladies who seriously lunched threw most of <i>the</i> parties in town.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The social register—capped at 400 names—was created by Caroline Astor. While the women gossiped, planned soirees, and dressed and redressed thoughout the day, the men were usually off yachting.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In terms of the deepest pockets, the two heavy-weight families in Newport were the Vanderbilts and the Astors. Cornelius Vanderbilt I, called Commodor Cornelius Vanderbilt, built his empire on steamships and railroads. Cornelius had amassed almost $100 million before he died in 1877. He gave most of it to his son William Henry, who, also shrewd in the railroading business, nearly doubled the family fortune over the next decade. William Henry Vanderbilt willed $70 million to his son Cornelius Vanderbilt II, who became the chairman and president of New York Central Railroad; and $55 million to son William K. Vanderbilt, who also managed railroads for awhile and saw his yacht, <i>The Defender</i>, win the America\'s Cup in 1895. One of Cornelius Vanderbilt II\'s sons, Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, died on the <i>Lusitania</i>, which sank three years after the <i>Titanic</i>.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Meanwhile in the Astor camp, John Jacob Astor IV, who perished on the <i>Titanic</i>, had the riches his great-granddad had made in the fur trade as well as his own millions earned from successful real estate ventures, including New York City hotels such as the St. Regis and the Astoria (later the Waldorf-Astoria, originally at the site of what is now the Empire State Building). His mother was Caroline Astor.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Homes in Newport related to the Vanderbilts are The Breakers, built for Cornelius II; and Marble House, built by William K. Vanderbilt for his wife, Alva, who later divorced him to marry tycoon Oliver H. P. Belmont. Astors\' Beechwood Mansion is Newport\'s only Astor home. Actors in the mansion relive the year 1891, so the Mrs. Astor herself might just say hello to you.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Architect Richard Morris Hunt modeled the four-story, 70-room residence after the palaces of the Italian Renaissance. From the outside, beginning with your walk through the Ivy League-like gate, you can see that this mansion is not only big but grand—be sure to spy out the sculptured figures tucked above the pillars. The Breakers\' interior includes rich marbles and gilded rooms, with open-air terraces revealing magnificent ocean views. A few of the marvels within are a blue marble fireplace, rose alabaster pillars in the dining room, and a porch with a mosaic ceiling that took Italian artisans six months, lying on their backs, to install. www.newportmansions.org. COST: $16. OPEN: Jan.-Mar., daily 10-4; Apr.-Dec., daily 9-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cliff Walk</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The spectacular 3½-mi Cliff Walk runs south along Newport\'s cliffs from Easton\'s Beach (also called First Beach) to Bailey\'s Beach. The promenade has views of sumptuous mansions on one side and the rocky coastline on the other; walking any section of it is worth the effort. The Cliff Walk can be accessed from any road running east off Bellevue Avenue. The unpaved sections can be difficult for small children, strollers, or people with mobility problems. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Elms</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Architect Horace Trumbauer modeled this graceful 48-room French neoclassical mansion and its grounds after the Château d\'Asnières near Paris. The Elms was built for Edward Julius Berwind, a bituminous-coal baron, in 1901 and was one of the first in Newport to be fully electrified. At the foot of the 10-acre estate is a spectacular sunken garden. The Behind the Scenes tours, which offer a glimpse into the life of staff and the operations (such as the boiler room and kitchen) of the mansion, is one of the best of any mansion tour. www.newportmansions.org. COST: $11, guided tour $15. OPEN: Mid-Apr.-Dec., daily 10-5; Jan.-Mar., weekends 10-4. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Rough Point</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The late tobacco heiress and preservationist Doris Duke hosted such celebs as Elizabeth Taylor at her Newport mansion perched on Cliff Walk. The 105-room home (with 49 principal rooms) was built in the English-manor style in 1889. An avid collector of art and antiques, Miss Duke filled Rough Point with works by such masters as Renoir and Reynolds (of all the Newport mansions, Duke\'s has the best art collection). Furnishings range from the elaborate to the peculiar (count the mother-of-pearl bedroom suite among the latter) and reflect the look of the mansion during Duke\'s final days here. Tours include an annual changing exhibit. To tour the mansion, take the Rough Point shuttle from the Newport Visitors\' Information Center. If you prefer to drive, you must make an online reservation. www.newportrestoration.org. COST: $25 (first-come, first-served basis).

You\'ll find nice sand and clean, warm seas in and around Methoni, in Messinia, and on the little island of Elafonisi. The Mani also has some good sand beaches, especially at the tip of the peninsula, at Porto Kayio and Marmari, near Cape Tenaro. Methoni and Pylos are the best-equipped resorts for windsurfing, sailing, and other water sports.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The beaches along the western coast of the Peloponnese are considered to be some of the best in Greece and are generally less crowded than those in other areas. Excellent stretches near Kastro, under Chlemoutsi Castle, include Katakolo and Spiantza. Closer to Patras is Kalogria, a 6-km (4-mi) stretch of sand bordered by pine forests. Along the Gulf of Corinth are some beaches with spectacular views of the opposite shore, but some are of pebbles rather than sand. Xylokastro, near Corinth, starts out pebbly but becomes sandy farther from town. The popular areas are well equipped for water sports: paddleboats can be hired, and you can arrange windsurfing lessons at small operations at many beaches, such as Tolo. In some resorts, such as Porto Heli, waterskiing and jet-skiing are popular diversions.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">City Pleasures</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nafplion is the favorite Greek city of many seasoned travelers, probably because it is graciously endowed with a magnificent setting on the Gulf of Argos, imposing remains, shady parks, lively squares, an animated waterfront, and street after street of old houses, churches, and mosques. A stroll on the promenade takes you around the peninsula on which the city is built, with views of the cliffs. Nafplion also has many good hotels and restaurants and is an excellent base from which to explore the nearby classical ruins. Should you want to take a well-deserved break from high-minded sightseeing, a number of good beaches are nearby.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Southern Peloponnese Itinerary</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Southern Peloponnese is a relatively uncrowded region, and you\'ll appreciate it most if you take time to linger in a village or savor the landscape over a picnic lunch. A short visit forces you to make some difficult choices: any of the four areas covered in this chapter can be explored in a few days, but in that time you may be tempted to explore more than <i>one</i> region. The suggested three-day itinerary has several options and takes in highlights of several regions, but you\'re moving around quickly. An eight-day tour gives you time to appreciate all the different regions.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On a three-day trip, you might make a quick visit to <b>Tripoli</b>, from where you can continue to the Arcadian mountain village of <b>Andritsena</b> and the <b>Temple of Apollo at Bassae</b>. These places and a string of other mountain villages—<b>Stemnitsa</b>, <b>Dimitsana</b>, and <b>Karitena</b> —can be visited in a full day. On the second day, head south through <b>Sparta</b> and the spectacular Byzantine ruins of <b>Mystras</b> to the harbor town of <b>Gythion</b> and the rugged Mani.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Continue to the medieval town of <b>Monemvassia</b> on the third day. As an alternative route, on the second day go southwest from Andritsena through <b>Kalamata</b> to the nearby ruins of <b>Ancient Messene</b> and from there west to <b>Pylos</b> and the resort town of <b>Methoni</b>. On the third day retrace your steps through <b>Kalamata</b> and then drop south into the Mani, with an overnight in <b>Kardamyli</b> or <b>Areopolis</b>.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 5 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pass through <b>Tripoli</b> and explore the Taygettus mountain villages of <b>Stemnitsa</b>, <b>Dimitsana</b>, <b>Karitena</b>, and <b>Andritsena</b> and the <b>Temple of Apollo at Bassae</b>. Spend the night in the fresh, cool air of Dimitsana or Andritsena, then descend to <b>Kalamata</b> and continue west to the ancient Mycenaean <b>Nestor\'s Palace</b> and <b>Pylos</b>, with its beautiful bay, for a night in the pleasantly low-key resort of <b>Methoni</b>, dominated by a remarkable Venetian fortress.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Then it\'s on to the Mani, where you can settle for at least two days in <b>Kardamyli</b>, <b>Areopolis</b>, or one of the character-filled hotels around <b>Vathia</b>. From there, continue to<b>Sparta</b> and the Byzantine city of <b>Mystras</b>, and spend your final night in medieval <b>Monemvassia</b>, carved out of rock and set high above the crashing surf.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 8 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Begin by exploring Arcadia, passing through <b>Tripoli</b> to the surrounding Taygettus mountain villages of <b>Stemnitsa</b>, <b>Dimitsana</b>, <b>Karitena</b>, and <b>Andritsena</b> and the <b>Temple of Apollo at Bassae</b>. After a day in these pine- and mulberry-scented mountains, make your way west to Messinia\'s major center, <b>Kalamata</b>, and from there to the ancient Mycenaean <b>Nestor\'s Palace</b> and the port town of <b>Pylos</b>, for its archaeological museum, fortresses, and a beautiful bay. Drop farther south to <b>Methoni</b>, where a remarkable Venetian fortress presides over a quiet beach and port.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Next venture into the Mani and base yourself for at least two days in <b>Kardamyli</b> or <b>Areopolis</b>, the sun-baked gateway to the Inner Mani. You might want to have a boatman row you along the underground rivers of the eerie <b>Pirgos Dirou Caves</b> and travel all the way down the stark Mani peninsula to <b>Vathia</b> and Cape Tenaro. For Byzantine ruins, cross the Langada Pass from Kalamata to <b>Sparta</b>, where you can stomp about the Laconian plain, seeing the last jewel in the Byzantine crown, <b>Mystras</b>, followed by a sojourn in the colorful Laconian port of <b>Gythion</b>. Then move on to <b>Monemvassia</b>, a medieval town tucked into a rock face.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Northern Peloponnese Itinerary</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The eastern and western portions of the Northern Peloponnese are easily divided into two separate three-day itineraries; a six-day tour catches the region\'s highlights, and a thorough exploration requires about nine days. Those with less time should consider investigating either the eastern or western half only; for travelers entering Greece from Italy, the Vouraikos Gorge and Olympia are options, and for those entering Greece through Athens, Nafplion and the Argolid are only a short hop away. One thing to keep in mind: people usually wind up asking themselves why they didn\'t allot more time to this fascinating area of Greece.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The wealth of interesting sites on either side of the Northern Peloponnese will keep the intrepid occupied for at least three days: start with a day in lovely <b>Nafplion</b>-followed by a day spent exploring some of the highlights of the Argolid—<b>Mycenae</b>-and <b>Tiryns</b>. A third day near Nafplion will allow a visit to the theater at <b>Epidauros</b>, or you can make the excursion west to <b>Olympia</b> -.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For those entering Greece from Italy and with only a couple of days to spare, try spending a day in <b>Olympia</b> -, a day enjoying the train ride along the picturesque <b>Vouraikos Gorge</b> en route to <b>Kalavrita</b>, and a day clambering over the parapets of the Frankish <b>Chlemoutsi Castle</b> and relaxing on a nearby beach.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 6 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend three days in <b>Nafplion</b>-and use the city as a base to explore the Argolid. You can get to Nafplion by boat, train, or car, and can rent transportation. The city itself is appealing, and from there you can easily explore nearby <b>Mycenae</b> -, <b>Tiryns</b>, <b>Epidauros</b>, and <b>Argos</b>.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the fourth day drop down through the mountains of the central Peloponnese to <b>Olympia</b> -, where you can spend the night. Then head around the top of the peninsula, passing <b>Chlemoutsi Castle</b> and taking some time out to enjoy a swim at one of the spectacular beaches nearby. You can spend the night in <b>Patras</b> or continue on to a more scenic place, such as Diakofto or <b>Kalavrita</b>, entry points for the <b>Vouraikos Gorge</b>, before getting your last dose of ruins in <b>Ancient Corinth</b>. Remember that this trip can be easily reversed if you are coming from Italy and arriving in Patras.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 9 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Starting at the isthmus, journey south toward Nafplion, visiting <b>Isthmia</b>, <b>Ancient Corinth</b>, and <b>Epidauros</b> en route. Spend five nights in <b>Nafplion</b> -, using it as a base for daily excursions. You\'ll want to spend at least one day exploring the beautiful city itself. The five major archaeological sites north of Nafplion—<b>Tiryns</b>, <b>Argos</b>, <b>Mycenae</b> -, <b>Ancient Nemea</b>, and <b>Ancient Corinth</b> —could easily occupy two or even three days, and you might also want to relax at one of the nearby beaches.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Olympia beckons the Peloponnesian traveler sooner or later, but don\'t rush. There\'s plenty to see en route from the Argolid, including the alluring beauty of the <b>Vouraikos Gorge</b>, which you can enjoy on an overnight stop in Diakofto or <b>Kalavrita</b>. You might want to spend a little time taking in the big-city scene of <b>Patras</b> and then press on to nearby sights such as the best-preserved Frankish castle in the Peloponnese, <b>Chlemoutsi Castle</b>, with a stop at the beautiful beach at <b>Kalogria.</b> Finally, take a languid trip through the verdant province of Elis to impressive, ancient <b>Olympia</b> -, where the Olympic Games were first held almost three millennia ago.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Classical Ruins</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The concentration of classical ruins in the Northern Peloponnese is more dense than anywhere else in the world. Ancient Corinth, Ancient Nemea, Mycenae, Argos, Tiryns, and Epidauros are all within a short drive of one another, near the city of Nafplion. This delightful city, with Byzantine, Venetian, and Turkish roots, makes an ideal base from which to explore the well-preserved ruins of ancient Greece. At some point you will also want to travel west to see the magnificent remains of the ancient city of Olympia, with the Temple of Zeus and the remnants of the Olympic stadium. You can view the finds from the sites in archaeological museums in Nafplion, Argos, Olympia, and elsewhere.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A journey through the Southern Peloponnese provides a unique opportunity for time travel, since you can explore a rich diversity of classical and medieval sites in the course of a single day. For an almost mind-boggling experience, consider a morning tour of the ruined buildings and colorful frescoes of the Byzantine city of Mystras, followed by stops at Ancient Messene, dating to the 4th century BC, and then Nestor\'s Palace, even older and mentioned in Homeric legend.

Built in the 4th century BC with 14,000 seats, the theater was never remodeled in antiquity, and because it was rather remote, the stones were never quarried for secondary building use. The extraordinary qualities of the theater were recognized even in the 2nd century AD. Pausanias of Lydia, the 2nd-century AD traveler and geographer, wrote, \"The Epidaurians have a theater in their sanctuary that seems to me particularly worth a visit. The Roman theaters have gone far beyond all the others in the world…but who can begin to rival Polykleitos for the beauty and composition of his architecture?\" In addition, the acoustics of his theater are so perfect that even from the last of the 55 tiers every word can be heard. Test this fact out during the <b>summer drama festival,</b> with its outstanding productions.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The condition of the rest of the <b>Sanctuary of Asklepios,</b> dedicated to the god of healing and the most important healing center in the ancient world, does not match the theater but is in the midst of a decades-long restoration project. Some copies of its sculptures are in the <b>site museum,</b> but the originals are in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. An exhibit of ancient medical implements is of interest, as are detailed models of the sanctuary and blueprints.

An intellectual and cultural center where philosophers like Chrysoloras, \"the sage of Byzantium,\" held forth on the good and the beautiful, Mystras seems an appropriate place for the last hurrah of the Byzantine emperors in the 14th century. Today the splendid ruins are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most impressive sights in the Peloponnese.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1249 William de Villehardouin built the castle in Mystras in an attempt to control Laconia and establish Frankish supremacy over the Peloponnese. He held court here with his Greek wife, Anna Comnena, surrounded by knights of Champagne, Burgundy, and Flanders, but in 1259 he was defeated by the Byzantines. As the Byzantines built a palace and numerous churches (whose frescoes exemplified several periods of painting), the town gradually grew down the slope.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">At first the seat of the Byzantine governor, Mystras later became the capital of the Despotate of Morea. It was the despots who made Mystras a cultural phenomenon, and it was the despots—specifically Emperor Constantine\'s brother Demetrios Palaiologos—who surrendered the city to the Turks in 1460, signaling the beginning of the end. For a while the town survived because of its silk industry, but after repeated pillaging and burning by bands of Albanians, Russians, and Ibrahim Pasha\'s Egyptian troops, the inhabitants gave up and moved to modern Sparta.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In spring Mystras is resplendent with wildflowers and butterflies, but it can be oppressively hot in summer, so get an early start. It\'s easy to spend half a day here. Bring water and sturdy shoes for the slippery rocks and the occasional snake.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Among the most important buildings in the lower town (Kato Chora) is <b>Ayios Demetrios,</b> the <i>mitropolis</i> (cathedral) founded in 1291. Set in its floor is a stone with the two-headed Byzantine eagle marking the spot where Constantine XII, the last emperor of Byzantium, was consecrated. The cathedral\'s brilliant frescoes include a vivid depiction of the Virgin and the infant Jesus on the central apse and a wall painting in the narthex of the Second Coming, its two red-and-turquoise-winged angels sorrowful as they open the records of Good and Evil. One wing of the church houses a <b>museum</b> that holds fragments of Byzantine sculptures, later Byzantine icons, decorative metalwork, and coins.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the Vrontokion monastery are <b>Ayios Theodoros</b> (AD 1295), the oldest church in Mystras, and the 14th-century <b>Church of Panagia Odegetria,</b> or <b>Afendiko,</b> which is decorated with remarkable murals. These include, in the narthex, scenes of the miracles of Christ: <i>The Healing of the Blind Man,</i><i>The Samaritan at the Well,</i> and <i>The Marriage of Cana.</i> The fluidity of the brushstrokes, the subtle but complicated coloring, and the resonant expressions suggest the work of extremely skilled hands.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Pantanassa monastery</b> is a visual feast of intricate tiling, rosette-festooned loops, and myriad arches. It is the only inhabited building in Mystras; the hospitable nuns still produce embroidery that you can purchase. Step out onto the east portico for a view of the Eurotas River valley below.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Every inch of the tiny <b>Perivleptos monastery,</b> meaning \"attracting attention from all sides,\" is covered with exceptional 14th-century illustrations from the New Testament, including <i>The Birth of the Virgin</i>; in a lush palette of reds, yellows, and oranges; <i>The Dormition of the Virgin</i> above the entrance (with Christ holding his mother\'s soul represented as a baby); and, immediately to the left of the entrance, the famous fresco the <i>Divine Liturgy.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the upper town (Ano Chora), where most aristocrats lived, stands a rare Byzantine civic building, the <b>Palace of Despots,</b> home of the last emperor. The older, northeastern wing contains a guardroom, a kitchen, and the residence. The three-story northwest wing contains an immense reception hall on its top floor, lighted by eight Gothic windows and heated by eight huge chimneys; the throne probably stood in the shallow alcove that\'s in the center of a wall.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the palace\'s <b>Ayia Sofia chapel,</b> the Italian wives of Emperors Constantine and Theodore Palaiologos are buried. Note the polychromatic marble floor and the frescoes that were preserved for years under whitewash, applied by the Turks when they transformed this into a mosque. Climb to the <b>castle</b> and look down into the gullies of Mt. Taygettus, where it\'s said the Spartans, who hated weakness, hurled their malformed babies. www.culture.gr.

The lure of this area is not indoors, air-conditioned, and antiseptic. It\'s all about being outside. This country is magnificent, whether you\'re perfecting that barely perceptible whisk of your hand-tied fly inches from the surface of a sun-dazzled creek in the High Uintas, listening to thousands of birds rising into the cool evening air over the Ouray National Wildlife Refuge, laughing out loud at the taste of cold river water drenching you as an experienced guide rafts you through the narrow walls of Dinosaur National Monument\'s sunset-color canyons, or savoring the smells of sage and wind-scoured sandstone as you pause during your hike along a high-ridge plateau over Price. Get outside. Take sunblock and water. And leave your walls at home.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">History</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">America\'s Wild West grabs the imagination like few other time periods. There\'s something about pioneers, cowboys, Native Americans, mountain men, outlaws, miners, and intrepid explorers that keeps us fascinated. In eastern Utah, the Wild West wasn\'t really so long ago. Homesteaders were still staking out their claims in the 1900s, and ranchers still ride horses and use sheep dogs to round up their livestock. A good portion of eastern Utah is actually the sovereign land of the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation. Experience the real West by searching for rock art, seeing a rodeo, watching the Northern Ute Pow Wow, touring the local history museums, visiting restored homesteads, or hiking or biking through landscapes that once sheltered outlaws and humbled pioneers.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Prehistory</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Throughout millions of years, eastern Utah was lush and verdant with giant ferns, flooded by seas, or frozen in ice. Now, all those layers of time have begun to reveal their secrets. Dinosaurs once trod footprints into mud or lay down to die beside fast-moving rivers in the regions we now know as Vernal and Price. When you come to eastern Utah, you are entering one of the world\'s most important areas of dinosaur and fossil research. Let yourself be swept up in dino-mania, and visit the College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum in Price, the Utah Field House of Natural History State Park in Vernal, and, of course, the astounding scenic wonders of Dinosaur National Monument just outside Vernal. And keep your eyes peeled for fossils wherever you hike.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The Uinta Mountains area, particularly in the High Uintas Wilderness where no vehicles are allowed, is prime country for pack trips, horseback day rides, hiking, and overnight backpacking between late June and September. The Uintas are ribboned with streams, and they have hundreds of small lakes set in rolling meadows. Access to the Uinta Mountains is either from Kamas (40 mi east of Salt Lake City on I-80) or from Route 150, 30 mi south of Evanston, Wyoming.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Winding its way up to the High Uinta country is the Mirror Lake Scenic Byway, which begins in Kamas. The 65-mi drive follows Route 150 through heavily wooded canyons past mountain lakes and peaks, cresting at 10,687-foot Bald Mountain Pass. A good place to stop en route is at <b>Upper Provo Falls</b>, near mile marker 24, where you can stroll the boardwalk to the terraced falls cascading with clear mountain water. Because of heavy winter snows, much of the road is closed from October to May. You can buy a guide to the byway from the Wasatch-Cache National Forest\'s Kamas Ranger District office in Kamas. www.fs.fed.us/r4/wcnf/unit/kamas. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Western Mining & Railroad Museum</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Western Mining &amp; Railroad Museum, which is in the Old Helper Hotel in Helper\'s National Historic District, is a treasure and doubles as a visitor center.

Rooms depict everyday activities of Helper\'s past and include a medical room, a children\'s toy room, a school room, a railroad office, and a beauty salon. One room is dedicated to the more illicit side of Helper, with a jail cell, stills, and early beer bottles. Incredible photographs and paintings put a face on Helper\'s history, and there\'s an outdoor exhibit of trains and mining equipment. www.wmrrm.org. COST: $2 donation.

They\'re the handiwork of the Fremont Indians, who lived in much of what is now Utah from AD 300 to 1250. The canyon also shelters the remnants of many early homesteads, stage stops, and ranches. However, the petroglyphs and pictographs are the main draws. It\'s important not to touch the fragile rock art because oils from your fingers can damage them. Most of this 80-mi round-trip is on a gravel road, so plan a day to complete it. Bring water and a picnic, because there are no services. A brochure detailing significant sites is available at the visitor center in the College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum in Price. Without it, many panels will go unnoticed. At the gas station where you turn off U.S. 6 in Wellington to head to the canyon, you can also buy a self-published book that contains a complete list of sites, photos, and directions. To reach the canyon, go 7½ mi east of Price on U.S. 6 and then turn north on Nine Mile Canyon Road. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The Bajío (ba<i>-hee-</i>o), as it is also called, corresponds roughly to the state of Guanajuato and parts of Querétaro and Michoacán states.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Intense Spanish colonization of the Heartland followed the discovery of silver in the area in the 1500s. Guanajuato was the site of the world\'s largest silver mine, and the Spanish conquistadors wasted no time in founding a network of towns such as Morelia, Zacatecas, and San Miguel de Allende, where they built mansions to fit their lavish lifestyles and protect their interests. Wealthy Creoles (Mexicans of Spanish descent) in Querétaro and San Miguel took the first audacious steps toward independence from Spain three centuries later. When their clandestine efforts were uncovered, two of the early insurgents, Ignacio Allende and Father Miguel Hidalgo, began in earnest the War of Independence.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Another native son, José María Morelos, rallied for independence when Allende and Hidalgo were executed in 1811. This<i> mestizo</i> (mixed race) mule skinner-turned-priest-turned-soldier nearly gained control of the land with his army of 9,000 before he was killed in 1815. Thirteen years later the city of Valladolid was renamed Morelia in his honor.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Long after the War of Independence ended in 1821, cities in the Bajío continued to figure prominently in Mexico\'s history. Three major events occurred in Querétaro alone: in 1848 the Mexican-American War ended with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo; in 1867 Austrian Maximilian of Habsburg, whom France\'s Napoléon III had crowned Emperor of Mexico, was executed in the hills north of town; and in 1917 the Mexican Constitution was signed here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Heartland continually honors the events and people that helped shape modern Mexico. In ornate cathedrals or bucolic plazas, down narrow alleyways or atop high hillsides, you\'ll find monuments—and remnants—of a heroic past. You can savor the region\'s historic spirit during its numerous fiestas. On a night filled with fireworks, off-key music, and tireless celebrants, it\'s hard not to be caught up in the vital expression of national pride.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Unlike areas where attractions are specifically designed for tourists, the Bajío relies on its historic ties and the architectural integrity of its cities to appeal to travelers. Families visit parks for Sunday picnics, youngsters tussle in school courtyards, old men chat in shaded plazas, and Purépecha women in traditional garb sell their wares in crowded markets.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Outdoorsy in San Miguel</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From birding and bathing to mountain biking and golfing, enjoying the outdoors around San Miguel, with its eternal spring climate, is an opportunity not to be missed.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Our favorite outdoor adventures in the region include <b>mountain biking and hiking</b><b>,</b> which may be the most intimate ways to get to know the San Miguel countryside. San Miguel is on the slopes of an ancient volcano called Los Picachos (not active). Riding or walking along narrow mountain paths, you\'ll find oak and pine forests, bogs, marshes, and streams where migrating birds come to feed. You may come across abandoned chapels, old mining sites, and ancient, solitary haciendas, all testimonies to long-forgotten times. There are several rental outfits specializing in mountain bikes, helmets, and gloves. Expert guides offer various tours for mountain biking and hiking according to your ability.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whether you have been trekking through the mountains or trudging over cobblestones, a swim in one of San Miguel\'s <b>thermal pools</b> is a welcome way to relax. All the <i>balnearios</i> are a short drive out of town, on the Dolores Hidalgo Highway. Balneario Xoté, with its slides and swings, is an ideal place to take kids.

During the Spanish conquest, Nuño de Guzmán, a lieutenant in Hernán Cortés\'s army, committed atrocities against the local population in his efforts to conquer western Mexico. He was eventually arrested by the Spanish authorities, and in 1537 Vasco de Quiroga was appointed bishop of Michoacán. To regain the trust of the indigenous people, he established model villages in the area and promoted the development of <i>artesanía</i> (crafts) commerce among the Purépecha.

The sanctuary\'s pine forest is so caked with orange-and-black butterflies it looks like it\'s on fire. Listen closely and you\'ll hear the rustle of millions of wings beating. The hike to the groves is a steep climb, and the high altitude (10,400 feet) will require that you take it slowly.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This day trip takes about 10 hours, but it\'s absolutely worth the effort.

St. Kitts became known as the mother colony of the West Indies: English settlers sailed from there to Antigua, Barbuda, Tortola, and Montserrat, while the French dispatched colonists to Martinique, Guadeloupe, St. Martin, and St. Barths.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">St. Kitts and Nevis, in addition to Anguilla, achieved self-government as an associated state of Great Britain in 1967. Anguillians soon made their displeasure known, separating immediately, while St. Kitts and Nevis waited until 1983 to become an independent nation. The two islands, despite their superficial similarities, have taken increasingly different routes regarding tourism. Nevis received an economic boost from the Four Seasons, which helped establish it as an upscale destination. St. Kitts, however, has yet to define its identity at a time when most islands have found their tourism niche. A fierce sibling rivalry has ensued.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though its comparative lack of development is a lure, the Kittitian government is casting its economic net in several directions. Golf, ecotourism, and scuba diving are being aggressively promoted. And the government hopes the number of available rooms will increase roughly 30% to more than 2,000, according to the \"build it and they will come\" philosophy. But is St. Kitts ready to absorb all this? The island offers a surprisingly diverse vacation experience while retaining its essential Caribbean flavor. Divers have yet to discover all its underwater attractions, while nature lovers will be pleasantly surprised by the hiking. There\'s now every kind of accommodation, as well as gourmet dining, golf, and gaming.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Meanwhile, Nevis seems determined to stay even more unspoiled (there are still no traffic lights). Its natural attractions and activities certainly rival those of St. Kitts, from mountain biking and ecohiking to windsurfing and deep-sea fishing, though lying in a hammock and dining on romantic candlelit patios remain cherished pursuits. Pinney\'s Beach, despite occasional hurricane erosion, remains a classic Caribbean strand. Its historic heritage, from the Caribbean\'s first hotel to Alexander Hamilton\'s childhood home, is just as pronounced, including equally sybaritic plantation inns that seem torn from the pages of a romance novel.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Perhaps it\'s a warning sign that many guests call the catamaran trip to Nevis the high point of their stay on St. Kitts—and many Kittitians build retirement and second homes on Nevis. The sister islands\' relationship remains outwardly cordial if slightly contentious. Nevis papers sometimes run blistering editorials advocating independence, though one plebiscite has already failed. St. Kitts and Nevis may separate some day, but for now, their battles are confined to ad campaigns and political debates. Fortunately, well-heeled and barefoot travelers alike can still happily enjoy the many energetic and easygoing enticements of both blissful retreats.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Nevis\'s Day at the Races</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the Caribbean\'s most festive, endearingly idiosyncratic events is the Nevis Turf and Jockey Club\'s Day at the Races, held 9 to 12 times a year on the wild and windswept Indian Castle course. I first experienced the event in the mid-1990s, when I met club president Richard \"Lupi\" Lupinacci, owner of the Hermitage Plantation Inn. Before even introducing himself, Richard sized me up in the driveway: \"You look about the right size for a jockey. How\'s your seat?\" His equally effervescent wife, Maureen, then interceded,\"Darling, if you loathe horses, don\'t worry. In fact, Lupi and I have an agreement about the Jerk and Turkey Club. I get major jewels for every animal he buys.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Since my riding skills were rusty, it was decided that I should be a judge (despite questionable vision, even with glasses). \"If it\'s really by a nose, someone will disagree with you either way,\" I was reassured. The next day presented a quintessential Caribbean scene. Although a serious cadre of aficionados (including the German consul) talked turf, the rest of the island seemed more interested in liming and enjoying lively music. Local ladies dished out heavenly barbecued chicken and devilish gossip. Sheep and cattle unconcernedly ambled across the course. But when real horses thundered around the oval, the wooden stands groaned under the weight of cheering crowds, and bookies hand-calculated the payouts.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The irregularly scheduled races continue, albeit now on a properly sodded track, as does the equine hospitality. The <b>Hermitage Stables</b> (Gingerland. tel. 869/469-3477) arrange everything from horseback riding to jaunts in hand-carved mahogany carriages. The <b>Nevis Equestrian Centre</b> (Cotton Ground, Pinney\'s Beach. tel. 869/469-8118) offers leisurely beach rides as well as more-demanding canters through the lush hills.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">—Jordan Simon</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

If you\'re driving it\'s not difficult to combine explorations of the Catskills with excursions into the Hudson Valley. Woodstock, for instance, is just a few miles from Kingston and Saugerties.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 2 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Focus on either the northern or southern Catskills. <b>Woodstock</b>, which has a smattering of shops and restaurants, makes a good base in the northern Catskills. From here you can easily go hiking, canoeing, kayaking, tubing, or fishing, or go to see Kaaterskill Falls. The ski resorts are accessible from here as well: the <b>Hunter Mountain ski area</b>, for example, is 19 mi to the north and the <b>Belleayre Mountain ski area</b> is about 30 mi to the west. The <b>Catskill Game Farm</b>, about 25 mi north, is also doable from here. Or make quick jaunts into small villages in the area: <b>Mount Tremper</b> (which also makes a good base) and <b>Phoenicia</b> or, closer to Belleayre, Fleischmanns, Margaretville, and Arkville. Be sure to devote a few hours to exploring Woodstock.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the southern Catskills the area around <b>Monticello</b> has a few good lodging choices, including a magnificent inn in Forestburgh and a golf-focused resort in Kiamesha Lake. If you head west, you can see the site of the famed 1969 Woodstock music festival on the outskirts of Bethel. The area is known for golf and fishing, so you may want to spend time on either or both of these activities. The fishing town of <b>Roscoe</b> is about 26 mi north of Monticello; if you\'re an avid angler, you\'ll want to base yourself here and focus on the fish. The Catskill Fly Fishing Center and Museum is in nearby Livingston Manor.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 5 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">During the warm-weather months, follow the two-day itinerary for the southern Catskills and then head to the northern Catskills on the morning of Day 3. Drive north on Route 17/I-86 to Route 30 and take that east into the <b>Belleayre Mountain ski area</b>. Explore Fleischmanns, Margaretville, or Arkville in the afternoon, or go hiking or mountain biking. Spend Day 4 exploring <b>Woodstock</b> (driving through <b>Mount Tremper</b> and <b>Phoenicia</b> on the way back to your base) and leave Day 5 for Kaaterskill Falls. During ski season, spend only one day in the southern Catskills and devote much of the rest of the time to the <b>Hunter Mountain ski area</b>, the <b>Belleayre Mountain ski area</b>, or the <b>Windham ski area</b>. In between time on the slopes, check out the surrounding villages. You may also want to spend a day in <b>Woodstock</b>.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pleasures & Pastimes</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Catskill Park</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Designated a state treasure in 1904, Catskill Park spans Ulster, Green, Delaware, and Sullivan counties. It encompasses 700,000 acres of public and private land, and some of the wildest country south of Maine, with bears, coyotes, rattlesnakes, and other creatures. About 60 percent of the land is privately owned; the nearly 300,000 acres of state land within the park is called the Catskill Forest Preserve. The park has 200 mi of marked trails, campgrounds, ponds, lakes, and mountains; 98 peaks rising above 3,000 feet make for inspired hiking. At 4,190 feet, Slide Mountain is the highest of the Catskill peaks.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fishing</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fly-fishing, one of the nation\'s greatest sports, is said to have gotten its start in the Catskills—more specifically, at Roscoe\'s Junction Pool, where the Willowemoc River runs into the Beaverkill. Serious anglers make it a point, at least once in their life, to fish the fabled waters around Roscoe, which is often called Trout Town, U.S.A. The state stocks brown trout to supplement the wild trout you can catch here. The Delaware River, another option, is much less heavily fished. Esopus Creek, which runs along part of Route 28 in and around Phoenicia, is one of the most productive wild-trout streams in the Northeast. Although the number of fish—mostly wild rainbow and brown trout, but also brook trout—in the Esopus is impressive, most fish are less than 12 inches in length.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Golf</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When most people think of golfing in the Catskills, they think of the dozen-plus courses in Sullivan County. Indeed, several of the courses in the southern Catskills are highly rated and offer good value. Standouts include the Grossinger Country Club\'s Big G and Little G courses and the Concord Resort &amp; Golf Club\'s Monster course; the course at the Villa Roma resort is another good option. For the best golf in the southern Catskills, however, detour to the Nevele Grand Resort &amp; Country\'s Club\'s 27 holes, designed by Robert Trent Jones and Tom Fazio. The resort is in Ellenville, at the eastern edge of the Catskills. The northern Catskills aren\'t as well supplied with courses, but you can still find places to play, including the Windham Country Club course, which earns high marks. Regardless of where you play, the mountainous scenery provides a beautiful backdrop. Much of the terrain is rather curvy, with big elevation changes, but you\'ll also find gentler 9-hole courses.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Skiing</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With several ski resorts and hundreds of trails, the Catskill Mountains draw loads of skiers. The northern Catskills, home to the region\'s main ski resorts—Hunter, Belleayre, and Windham, as well as the smaller and quieter Plattekill—see most of the action. Many skiers come for the weekend from the metro New York area, satisfied with vertical drops of 1,100 to 1,600 feet. The drive\'s not bad either: about 2½ to 3 hours from New York City. Buses also serve the ski areas. Facilities offer lessons and trails for all levels of experience. Snowboarding and snowtubing in terrain parks are popular too, in part thanks to the superlative snowmaking abilities of the area resorts. Winters here are usually long and cold, allowing for the season to stretch to six months.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Borscht Belt</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Liberty and Monticello are jumping-off points for the legendary Catskills resorts. The cool, dry atmosphere of the region and its proximity to New York City attracted early sufferers of tuberculosis and other lung ailments. Later, Russian and Eastern European Jews flocked here to escape the heat and disease of New York City\'s immigrant ghettos.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Over time, this network of vacation spots came to be known as the Borscht Belt, and served as boot camp for innumerable entertainers who later gained national prominence. The Catskills churned out comedians Milton Berle, Freddie Roman, and Danny Kaye, to name a few. Old-time resorts like the Concord and Grossinger\'s are still standing, some as hotels and others as popular golf destinations. The influence of the resorts era has faded from the landscape, but the Yiddish sayings uttered by the local high-school kids are remnants of a period of Catskills history that affected a county and a country.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

To access the trail that leads to the bottom of the falls, park in the public lot on Route 23A 3 mi west of Palenville. To get to the trailhead, walk about ¼ mi down (east) along the narrow shoulder of Route 23A, a very busy road with hairpin turns; you may find yourself hugging rocks as cars pass you. Signs point the way to the path, which leads you past the delicate Bastion Falls. Although largely level, the trail does have a few steep sections. Altogether the hike is less than 1 mi long and shouldn\'t take a full hour. You may be tempted to climb to the top of the falls, but this is really risky and can\'t be recommended: missteps on the slippery rocks here have resulted in many accidents and some fatalities. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The <b>Buffalo Bill Cody Museum</b> is dedicated to the incredible life of William F. \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody. Shortly after Cody\'s death, some of his friends took mementos of the famous scout and Wild West showman and opened the Buffalo Bill Museum in a small log building. The museum has since been moved to the historical center and includes films, huge posters from the original Wild West shows, and illustrated books as well as personal effects such as clothing, guns, saddles, and furniture. The <b>Cody Firearms Museum</b> traces the history of firearms through thousands of models on display, from European blunderbusses to Gatling guns and modern firearms. Included are examples of Winchester and Browning arms, as well as a model of an arms-manufacturing plant. There are also the 1881 Navy revolvers belonging to Cody friend James \"Wild Bill\" Hickok. Legend has it that Hickok\'s revolvers had to be sold after his death, following a lethal card game in Deadwood, to bury him. At the time of his death, Hickok was holding a pair of black aces and a pair of eights—since known as a \"Dead Man\'s Hand.\" Through exhibits, outdoor activities, tours, and seminars, the <b>Draper Museum of Natural History</b> explores the Yellowstone ecosystem. There are children\'s discovery areas in addition to life-size animal mounts. Recordings play the sounds of wolves, grizzly bears, birds, and other animals that make their home in the Yellowstone area. At the <b>Plains Indian Museum,</b> interactive exhibits and life-size dioramas explore the history and culture of the Lakota, Blackfeet, Cheyenne, Shoshone, and Nez Perce tribes. Among the exhibits are rare medicine pipes, clothing, and an earth-house interpretive area. The <b>Whitney Gallery of Western Art</b> is devoted to the West\'s greatest artists.

Farther north are stunning geological features like the Old Man of Storr and Kilt Rock.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Tuck into some seafood:</b> Amazing regional specialties abound. Sample Bracadale crab, Dunvegan Bay langoustines, and Sconser king scallops, as well as the local smoked salmon, lobster, scallops, and oysters. Finish up with Stornoway black pudding.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Walk the coast in the Outer Hebrides:</b> There are no wilder places in Britain to enjoy an invigorating coastal walk than on the islands of Lewis and the Uists. Expect vast swaths of golden sand set against blue bays, or—when the weather is rough—giant waves crashing against the rocks.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Get close to nature:</b> Seals, deer, otters, as well as an abundance of birdlife can be seen throughout the Northern Highlands and Western Isles. Don\'t miss a boating foray to the Handa Island bird reserve, off Scourie.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Drive a single-track road:</b> In the Northern Highlands, take a drive on single-track roads like Destitution Road, north of Gairloch, which lead through the most dramatic scenery in Britain. The area is a primeval landscape where strange craggy mountains, with Gaelic and Nordic names like An Teallach, Suilven, and Stac Pollaidh, jut out of vast, desolate bog lands dotted with lochans.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Clans and Tartans</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Whatever the origins of the clans—some with Norman roots, intermarried into Celtic society; some of Norse origin, the product of Viking raids on Scotland; others traceable to the monastic system; yet others possibly descended from Pictish tribes—by the 13th century the clan system was at the heart of Gaelic tribal culture. By the 15th century the clan chiefs of the Scottish Highlands were a threat even to the authority of the Stewart monarchs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The word <i>clann</i> means \"family\" or \"children\" in Gaelic, and it was the custom for clan chiefs to board out their sons among nearby families, a practice that helped to bond the clan unit and create strong allegiances: the chief became \"father\" of the tribe and was owed loyalty by lesser chiefs and ordinary clansmen.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Clan System</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The clan chiefs\' need for strong men-at-arms, fast-running messengers, and bards for entertainment and the preservation of clan genealogy was the probable origin of the Highland Games, still celebrated in many Highland communities each year, and which are an otherwise rather inexplicable mix of sports, music, and dance.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Gradually, by the 18th century, increasing knowledge of Lowland agricultural improvements, and better roads into the Highlands that improved communication of ideas and \"southern\" ways, began to weaken the clan system. After Culloden, as more modern economic influences took hold, those on the \"wrong\" side lost all; many chiefs lost their lands, tartan was banned, and clan culture withered.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Tartan Revival</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tartan\'s own origins as a part of the clan system are disputed; the Gaelic word for striped cloth is <i>breacan</i>—piebald or spotted—so even the word itself is not Highland. However, when cloth was locally spun, woven, and dyed using plant derivatives, each neighborhood would have different dyestuffs. In this way, particular combinations of colors and favorite patterns of the local weavers could become associated with a particular area and therefore clan.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Between 1746 and 1782 the wearing of tartan was generally prohibited. By the time the ban was lifted, many recipes for dyes and weaving patterns had been forgotten.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It took the influence of Sir Walter Scott, with his romantic (and fashionable) view of Highland history, to create the \"modern myth\" of clans and tartan. Sir Walter engineered George IV\'s visit to Scotland in 1822, which turned into a tartan extravaganza. The idea of one tartan or group of tartans \"belonging\" to one particular clan was created at this time—literally created, with new patterns and color ways dreamed up and \"assigned\" to particular clans. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert reinforced the tartan culture later in the century.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\'s considered \"proper\" in some circles to wear the \"right\" tartan, that is, that of your clan. You may be able to find a clan connection with expertise such as that available at the <b>Clan Tartan Centre</b> (70-74 Bangor Rd., Leith, Edinburgh, EH6 5JU. tel. 0131/553-5161).</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Dating from the 14th century, this romantic icon has all the massive stone walls, timber ceilings, and winding stairs that you could ask for. Empty and neglected for years after being bombarded by frigates of the Royal Navy during an abortive Spanish-Jacobite landing in 1719, it was almost entirely rebuilt from a ruin in the early 20th century. The kitchen re-creates the busy scene before a grand banquet. Now the hero of travel brochures, Eilean Donan has appeared in many Hollywood movies and TV shows. www.eileandonancastle.com.

Its harmonious environs, with tall Scots pines and the mountain Slioch looming as a backdrop, witnessed the destruction of much of the tree cover in the 18th century. Iron ore was shipped in and smelted using local oak to feed the furnaces. Oak now grows here only on the northern limits of the range. Scottish Natural Heritage has an <b>information center</b> and nature trails by the loch and in the Beinn Eighe Nature Reserve. Red-deer sightings are virtually guaranteed; locals say the best place to spot another local denizen, the endangered pine marten (a member of the weasel family), is around the trash containers in the parking turnoffs. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Arawak Indians, the island\'s first known inhabitants, prospered until the warring Caribs invaded, adding the peaceful Arawaks to their list of conquests. Columbus spotted the isle in 1493, but it wasn\'t populated by Europeans until the 17th century, when it was claimed by the Dutch, French, and Spanish. The Dutch and French finally joined forces to claim the island in 1644, and the Treaty of Concordia partitioned the territory in 1648.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Both sides of the island offer a touch of European culture along with a lot of laid-back Caribbean ambience. Water sports abound—diving, snorkeling, scuba, sailing, windsurfing, and in late February the Heineken Regatta, with as many as 300 sailboats competing from around the world. (For the experience of a lifetime, some visitors purchase a working berth aboard a regatta vessel.)</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With soft trade winds cooling the subtropical climate, it\'s easy to while away the day relaxing on one of the 37 beaches, strolling Philipsburg\'s boardwalk, and perusing the shops on Philipsburg\'s Front Street or the <i>rues</i> (streets) of the very French town of Marigot. While luck is an important commodity at St. Maarten\'s 13 casinos, chance plays no part in finding a good meal at the excellent eateries or after-dark fun in the subtle to sizzling nightlife. Still, the isle\'s biggest assets are its friendly residents.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although the island has been heavily developed—especially on the Dutch side—somehow the winding, unmarked roads escaped improvement. When cruise ships are in port (and there can be as many as seven at once), shopping areas are crowded and traffic moves at a snail\'s pace. We suggest spending the days on the beach or the water, and plan shopping excursions for the early morning or at cocktail hour, after \"rush hour\" traffic calms down. Still, these are minor inconveniences compared to the feel of the sand between your toes or the breeze through your hair, gourmet food sating your appetite, or having the ability to crisscross between two nations on one island.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Concordia</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The smallest island in the world to be shared between two different countries, St. Maarten/St. Martin has existed peacefully in its subdivided state for more than 360 years. The Treaty of Concordia, which subdivided the island, was signed in 1648 and was really inspired by the two resident colonies of French and Dutch settlers (not to mention their respective governments) joining forces to repel a common enemy, the Spanish, in 1644. Although the French were promised the side of the island facing Anguilla and the Dutch the south side of the island, the boundary itself wasn\'t firmly established until 1817 and then after several disputes (16 of them, to be exact).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Visitors to the island will likely not even notice that they have passed from the Dutch to the French side unless they notice that the roads on the French side feel a little smoother. In 2003, the population of St-Martin (and St-Barthélemy) voted to secede from Guadeloupe, the administrative capital of the French West Indies. That detachment became official in February 2007, and St-Martin is now officially known as the Collectivité de Saint-Martin.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">St. Maarten vs. St. Martin</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If this is your first trip to St. Maarten/St. Martin, you\'re probably wondering which side will better suit your needs. That\'s hard to say, because in some ways the difference between the two can seem as subtle as the hazy boundary line dividing them. But there are some major differences. St. Maarten, the Dutch side, has the casinos, more nightlife and bigger hotels. St. Martin, the French side, has no casinos, less nightlife, and hotels that are smaller and more intimate. Many have kitchenettes, and most include breakfast. Even though there are many good restaurants on the Dutch side, the French side rules when it comes to gourmet dining. The biggest difference might be currency—the Netherlands Antilles guilder on the Dutch side, the euro on the French side. Of course, many establishments on both sides accept U.S. dollars.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

In preparation for that project, the archaeologists began to dig, turning up artifacts and the remains of structures that date to AD 900. The site was once a village occupied by the Taino, a peaceful group that lived in the area for many centuries. A similar but not quite as ancient village was discovered at Cinnamon Bay.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">By the time the Tainos got to Cinnamon Bay—they lived in the area from about AD 1000 to 1500—their society had developed to include chiefs, commoners, workers, and slaves. The location of the national park\'s busy Cinnamon Bay campground was once a Taino temple that belonged to a king or chief. When archaeologists began digging in 1998, they uncovered several dozen <i>zemis,</i> which are small clay gods used in ceremonial activities, as well as beads, pots, and many other artifacts.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Near the end of the Cinnamon Bay dig, archaeologists turned up another less ancient but still surprising discovery. A burned layer indicated that a plantation slave village had also stood near Cinnamon Bay campground; it was torched during the 1733 revolt because its slave inhabitants had been loyal to the planters. Since the 1970s, bones from slaves buried in the area have been uncovered at the water\'s edge by beach erosion.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The parking lot often overflows, but you can park along the road. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Coki Beach</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Funky beach huts selling local foods like meat pates (fried turnovers with a spicy ground-beef filling), picnic tables topped with umbrellas sporting beverage logos, and a brigade of hair braiders and taxi men give this beach overlooking picturesque Thatch Cay a Coney Island feel. But this is the best place on the island to snorkel and scuba dive. Fish, including grunts, snappers, and wrasses, are like an effervescent cloud you can wave your hand through. Ashore you can find conveniences like restrooms, changing facilities, mask and fin rentals, and even fish food. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Magens Bay</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Deeded to the island as a public park, this heart-shape stretch of white sand is considered one of the most beautiful in the world. The bottom of the bay is flat and sandy, so this is a place for sunning and swimming rather than snorkeling. On weekends and holidays the sounds of music from groups partying under the sheds fill the air. There\'s a bar, snack shack, and beachwear boutique; bathhouses with restrooms, changing rooms, and saltwater showers are close by. Sunfish and paddleboats are the most popular rentals at the water-sports kiosk. East of the beach is Udder Delight, a one-room shop at St. Thomas Dairies that serves a Virgin Islands tradition—a milk shake with a splash of Cruzan rum. Kids can enjoy virgin versions, which have a touch of soursop, mango, or banana flavoring. If you arrive between 8 AM and 5 PM, you pay an entrance fee of $3 per person, $1 per vehicle, and 25 per child under age 12. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

In 1631 the Dutch built a fort here, but so far no one has been able to locate its site. English settlers from St. Kitts colonized the island in 1650, with plans to cultivate tobacco and, later, cotton and then sugar. But the thin soil and scarce water doomed these enterprises to fail. Except for a brief period of independence, when it broke from its association with St. Kitts and Nevis in the 1960s, Anguilla has remained a British colony ever since.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the early 1800s various island federations were formed and disbanded, with Anguilla all the while simmering over its subordinate status and enforced union with St. Kitts. Anguillians twice petitioned for direct rule from Britain and twice were ignored. In 1967, when St. Kitts, Nevis, and Anguilla became an associated state, the mouse roared; citizens kicked out St. Kitts\'s policemen, held a self-rule referendum, and for two years conducted their own affairs. To what <i>Time</i> magazine called \"a cascade of laughter around the world,\" a British \"peacekeeping force\" of 100 paratroopers from the Elite Red Devil unit parachuted onto the island, squelching Anguilla\'s designs for autonomy but helping a team of royal engineers stationed there to improve the port and build roads and schools. Today Anguilla elects a House of Assembly and its own leader to handle internal affairs, while a British governor is responsible for public service, the police, the judiciary, and external affairs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The territory of Anguilla includes a few islets (or cays, pronounced \"keys\"), such as Scrub Island, Dog Island, Prickly Pear Cay, Sandy Island, and Sombrero Island. The 10,000 or so residents are predominantly of African descent, but there are also many of Irish background, whose ancestors came over from St. Kitts in the 1600s. Historically, because the limestone land was unfit for agriculture, attempts at enslavement never lasted long; consequently, Anguilla doesn\'t bear the scars of slavery found on so many other Caribbean islands. Instead, Anguillians became experts at making a living from the sea and are known for their boatbuilding and fishing skills. Tourism is the stable economy\'s growth industry, but the government carefully regulates expansion to protect the island\'s natural resources and beauty. New hotels are small, select, and casino-free; Anguilla emphasizes its high-quality service, serene surroundings, and friendly people.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Day at the Boat Races</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you want a different kind of trip to Anguilla, try for a visit during Carnival, which starts on the first Monday in August and continues for about 10 days. Colorful parades, beauty pageants, music, delicious food, arts-and-crafts shows, fireworks, and nonstop partying are just the beginning. The music starts at sunrise jam sessions—as early as 4 AM—and continues well into the night. The high point? The boat races. They are the national passion and the official national sport of Anguilla.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Anguillians from around the world return home to race old-fashioned, made-on-the-island wooden boats that have been in use on the island since the early 1800s. Similar to some of today\'s fastest sailboats, these are 15 to 28 feet in length and sport only a mainsail and jib on a single 25-foot mast. The sailboats have no deck, so heavy bags of sand, boulders, and sometimes even people are used as ballast. As the boats reach the finish line, the ballast—including some of the sailors—gets thrown into the water in a furious effort to win the race. Spectators line the beaches and follow the boats on foot, by car, and by even more boats. You\'ll have almost as much fun watching the fans as the races.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The White Continent. The last frontier of adventure travel. If you\'ve come all the way to southern Patagonia, why not extend your journey, venture a bit farther south and catch a glimpse of the land of eternal winter at the bottom of the world?</div><br><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although tourism to Antarctica has increased dramatically in recent years, as the 2007 sinking of the cruise ship <i>Explorer</i> demonstrated, Antarctica is not a risk-free destination. Travel companies might offer gourmet meals and Pilates classes for passengers cruising off the Antarctic peninsula, but travelers should always keep in mind that luxury aside, the beauty of Antarctica is matched only by its isolation and utterly inhospitable environment. By all means, go to Antarctica, but choose your tour company with great care, searching out operators who prioritize safety, not price or amenities.</div><br><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most Antarctic cruises depart from Ushuaia, cross the Drake Passage and spend about a week cruising the Antarctic peninsula. The cruising season runs from November through March. Early season is best for viewing icebergs, while whales and other marine wildlife are especially plentiful in February and March. Most ships incorporate landings via Zodiac at various points along the peninsula, but remember that as with everything in Antarctica, these excursions are totally weather dependent.</div><br><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The size of the cruise ship you take to Antarctica is an important and oft-overlooked consideration. Although large ships may offer more in the way of lectures and amenities, they have major drawbacks. There is a limit on the number of passengers who can disembark at any given attraction, so passengers on a large ship will have to take turns, and may miss out on the best landing points. Likewise, the sinking of the small <i>Explorer</i> notwithstanding, smaller ships are generally safer than the larger alternatives, because many are former icebreakers converted to cruise ships. One good one is the <b>Antarctic Dream</b> (www.antarctic.cl), a former Chilean navy vessel now operated by the Antarctic Shipping company.</div><br><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Safety should always be your first priority, but if price is a sticking point, you can look into booking last-minute at a steep discount in Ushuaia. Doing so can save you thousands of dollars, but you will not be able to choose your ship with the proper care.</div><br><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators</b> is an exemplary organization that promotes safe and environmentally friendly Antarctic tourism.

Food and water abundant! Gold for the taking! Fast side-trip to the Orient! Friendly welcoming committee!\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The real trip: 73 passengers will die. There\'s no gold. Fresh water and food are difficult to obtain. There is no way to sail to the Orient across North America. The land belongs to the natives, who are usually hostile, and disease-carrying mosquitoes are omnipresent.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The men and boys who settled Jamestown in 1607 had little idea of what was in store for them. Most who sailed over were intent on finding riches and hadn\'t given much thought to how they would survive in Virginia. Almost immediately after landing, the colonists were under attack from the Algonquian natives, and in a little over a month the settlers built a wooden fort named for King James.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One man, Captain John Smith, a soldier and adventurer who had fought in Hungary and Transylvania, was familiar with challenges and worked toward the survival of Jamestown. \"America\'s first hero\" made contact with the native chief Powhatan, from whom the colonists obtained much of their food, and became leader of the colony. After being captured by Algonquians, he may or may not have been saved by the 11-year-old princess Pocahontas, but was returned to Jamestown.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Finding the colony languishing due to lack of supplies, a drought, laziness, and conflicts, Smith instituted a policy of rigid discipline and strengthened defenses. He encouraged farming with the admonishment: \"He who does not work, will not eat.\" Because of his strong leadership, the settlement survived and grew during the next year. Unfortunately Smith was injured and returned to England for treatment in October 1609, never to set foot in Virginia again.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Nearly 300 years later, Jamestown was acquired by the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (APVA) and the National Park Service. Early archaeologists concluded that James Fort lay completely under the James River. In 1994, however, in preparation for the 400th Anniversary of Jamestown, APVA initiated its own excavations to search for the original 1607 fort. They uncovered evidence that James Fort had not been washed into the river, as most had believed.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Excavation has since uncovered more than 150,000 artifacts dating to the first half of the 17th century. Nearly half date to the first years of English settlement (1607-10). These objects reflect trade between Europe and the New World, patterns of warfare, day-to-day survival, and status in the early colony. You can view a sampling of these artifacts at Historic Jamestowne, whose mission is \"to preserve, protect, and promote the original site of the first permanent English settlement in North America and to tell the story of the role of the three cultures—European, North American and African—that came together to lay the foundation for a uniquely American form of democratic government, language, free enterprise, and society.\"</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Williamsburg Outlet Shopping</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You can find many outlet malls less than 10 minutes west of Colonial Williamsburg, in the tiny town of Lightfoot. If you\'re driving from Richmond to Williamsburg on I-64, take Exit 234 west to Lightfoot. When you reach U.S. 60 (Richmond Road), the outlets—both freestanding and in shopping centers—are on both sides of the road. Most outlet shops are open Monday-Saturday 10-9, Sunday 10-6.

Redbrick foundation walls roughly outline the settlement, and artists\' conceptions of the original buildings can be seen at several locations. The only standing structure is the ruin of a church tower from the 1690s, now part of the Memorial Church built in 1907; the markers within indicate the original church\'s foundations.

The site marries 40,000 square feet of indoor facilities (completed in 2006) with outdoor replicas of the early James Fort, the three ships that brought the founding colonists from England, and a Powhatan Indian village. The introductory film 1.<i>607: A Nation Takes Root</i> is shown in a 250-seat theater. The handsome Tudor-style Great Hall is arranged by decades from 1607 to 1699, when the capital was moved to Williamsburg. Gallery exhibits examine the lives of the Powhatans and their English-born neighbors, their interaction, and world conditions that encouraged colonization. Outdoors within James Fort, interpreters in costume cook, forge metal, and describe what life was like living under thatch roofs and between walls of wattle and daub (stick framework covered with mud plaster). In the Powhatan Indian village you can enter a <i>yehakin</i> (house) and see buckskin-costumed interpreters cultivate crops and make tools. At the pier are full-scale reproductions of the ships in which the settlers arrived: <i>Godspeed, Discovery,</i> and <i>Susan Constant</i>. All the vessels are seaworthy; you may climb aboard the <i>Susan Constant</i> and find out more from the sailor-interpreters. Indoor exhibits examine the lives of the Powhatans and their English-born neighbors, their interaction, and world conditions that encouraged colonization. A riverfront discovery area provides information about 17th-century water travel, commerce, and cultural exchange, reflecting Powhatan Indian, European, and African traditions. Dugout-canoe making takes place in this area. Spring and fall bring lots of school groups, so it\'s best to arrive after 2 PM. www.historyisfun.org.

These beacons were once tended by service keepers. But one by one they\'ve been automated and transferred to the Coast Guard, the National Park Service, or a nonprofit organization.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The last major lighthouse constructed is the first you reach traveling from north to south: Currituck Beach Lighthouse (162 feet, 1875) is an unpainted redbrick tower. Bodie Island Lighthouse (165 feet, 1872) is covered in broad horizontal black-and-white stripes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cape Hatteras Lighthouse is famous as America\'s tallest brick lighthouse (208 feet, 1870) and for having been relocated 2,900 feet inland in 1999. Ocracoke Lighthouse (77 feet, 1817), rebuilt after a fire in 1823, is the second-oldest lighthouse in the United States still in continuous service. The bright white exterior was once achieved with a whitewash blend of unslaked lime, glue, rice, salt, and powdered fish.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cape Lookout Lighthouse (169 feet, 1859) is painted with distinctive black-and-white diamonds—black facing north and south, white facing east and west. Bald Head Island Lighthouse (90 feet, 1817), nicknamed \"Old Baldy,\" is south of Southport; visitors can climb 112 steps to the top of its octagonal weathered gray tower. Far to the south, Oak Island Lighthouse (169 feet, 1958) is the U.S.\'s youngest lighthouse and has the last manually operated light in the world. But it lacks the elegance of its older siblings: the completely cylindrical tower has three broad horizontal stripes—black, white, and gray, and its beacon is so bright and hot that workman have to wear protective clothing when working on it.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">First in Flight</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">December 17, 1903, was a cold and windy day on the Outer Banks, but Wilbur and Orville Wright took little notice. The slightly built brothers from Ohio were undertaking an excellent adventure. With Orville at the controls, Wilbur running alongside, and the men of the nearby Lifesaving Service stations acting as ground crew, the fragile <i>Wright Flyer</i> lifted off from the Kill Devil Hills dune near Kitty Hawk and flew 120 feet in 12 seconds.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">John Daniels, an Outer Banker, photographed the instant the world forever changed: a heavier-than-air machine was used to achieve controlled, sustained flight with a pilot aboard. To prove they were not accidental aviators, the Wrights took two flights each that day, and in Wilbur\'s second attempt, he flew 852 feet in 59 seconds.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Others were attempting—and dying in the attempt of—powered flight as the Wright brothers opened their Dayton bicycle-repair shop in 1892. Using information on aerodynamics from the Smithsonian Institution and observation of birds in flight, they began experimenting using a box kite roughly shaped like a biplane and a makeshift wind tunnel. The strong, steady winds drew them to the then-remote Outer Banks, where they could test their next phase, manned glider flights, in privacy. In time, they added power to the three-axis control they developed and eventually solved the problems of mechanical flight, lift, and propulsion that had vexed scientists for hundreds of years.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Their success is honored at the Wright Brothers National Memorial in Kill Devil Hills and by the North Carolina boast emblazoned on millions of license plates: first in flight.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Generally, tribes used indigenous ingredients and supplies that were at hand: those living along rivers and waterways were more apt to produce baskets, since reeds were plentiful; tribes that required water to be carried to their village were most likely to create pottery.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Once the railroads were built and travelers started coming west by train, Fred Harvey, who had set up fine-eating establishments at railroad stops along the route, realized that the Easterners were looking for souvenir handicrafts to take home with them. He encouraged Navajo weavers to create large pieces, like rugs and wall hangings. Navajos wove blankets from wool using natural plant dyes for color, and each community is known for specific colors and designs that are passed down from mother to daughter for generations.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Common Crafts</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Native beadwork traces its origins to trades with early trappers and explorers. Trade beads, as they were known, often came from Europe, and became popular adornments for clothing and everyday items. Beaded fetishes, drums, rattles, and dolls were often part of spiritual ceremonies.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The famous squash-blossom necklaces, if completely handmade, can run more than $1,000, especially if the silver beads are made as two separate hemispheres. Proud craftsmen have individual logos or personal marks that are put into each piece. Authentic pieces will also indicate that the silver is sterling.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hand-woven blankets and rugs can be expensive. A medium-size rug (5 by 7 feet) with a complex pattern may require more than half a year to create, so don\'t be shocked if the price tag reads above $30,000.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Shopping Tips</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Your best bet for big-ticket items is to buy directly from the craftsmen themselves or from a reputable dealer. If you\'re traveling in Navajoland, the Cameron Trading Post north of Flagstaff or the Hubbell Trading Post at Ganado are two spots where you can find exemplary items. In Phoenix the gift shop at the famed Heard Museum offers some of the finest Native American handicrafts at reasonable prices.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most products sold on the Hopi and Navajo reservations are authentic, but fakes are not unheard-of. Trading posts are very reliable, as are most roadside stands, which can offer some outstanding values, but be wary of solo vendors hanging around parking lots. If you\'re planning on shopping on the Hopi Reservation or elsewhere outside the Navajo trading posts, it\'s a good idea to carry cash, as not all vendors accept credit cards.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Navajo and the Hopi</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Both the Navajo and Hopi base their culture on the land around them, but they are very different from one another. The Navajo refer to themselves as the Diné (pronounced din-<i>eh</i>)—\"the people\"—and live on 17 million acres in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado. The Hopi trace their roots back to the original settlers of the area, whom they call the <i>Hisatsinom,</i> or \"people of long ago\"—they are also known as Anasazi, meaning both \"ancient ones\" and \"ancient enemies.\" Hopi culture is more formal and structured than that of the Navajo, and their religion has remained stronger and purer. For both tribes unemployment is high on the reservation, and poverty a constant presence.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Navajo</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Navajos use few words and have a subtle sense of humor that can pass you by quickly if you\'re not a good listener. From childhood they are taught not to talk too much, be loud, or show off. Eye contact is considered impolite. If you\'re conversing with Navajos, some may look down or away even though they are paying attention to you. Likewise, touching is seen differently; handshaking may be the only physical contact that you see. When shaking hands, a light touch is preferred to a firm grip, which is considered overbearing.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">\"Code Talkers\"</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although most Navajos speak English with varying degrees of mastery, listen closely to the language of the Diné. Stemming from the Athabascan family of languages, it is difficult for outsiders to learn because of subtle accentuation. The famous Marine Corps Navajo \"code talkers\" of World War II saved thousands of lives in the South Pacific by creating a code within their native Navajo language. Their unbreakable radio messages mystified the Japanese, and got through safely and accurately to American troops. These Native Americans are true patriots, who today speak humbly of their accomplishments. Many \"code talkers\" still alive today reside in the area around Tuba City.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hopi</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hopi mythology holds that a white-skinned people will save the tribe from its difficult life. Long ago, however, in the face of brutal treatment by whites, most Hopi became convinced that salvation would originate elsewhere. (Some Hopi now look to the Dalai Lama for redemption.)</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ceremonial Dances</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most Hopi ceremonies take place in village plazas and kivas (underground ceremonial chambers) and last two days or longer; outsiders are sometimes permitted to watch segments of some ceremonies but are never allowed into kivas unless invited.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Reservation Realities</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although not easy to witness, the disappointment of the Hopi and the despair of the Navajo are easy to understand after a visit to the reservation. Most Navajo and Hopi disapprove of the practice, but some panhandlers cluster at shopping centers and view sites, hoping to glean a few tourist dollars. Visitors should respond to panhandlers with a polite but firm \"no.\" If you wish to help, make a donation to a legitimate organization that raises funds at reservation grocery stores.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Who Were the Cliff Dwellers?</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The first inhabitants of the canyons arrived more than 2,000 years ago—anthropologists call them the basket makers, because baskets were the predominant artifacts they left behind. By AD 750, however, the basket makers had disappeared—their reason for leaving the region is unknown, but some speculate they were forced to leave because of encroaching cultures or climatic changes—and they were replaced by Pueblo tribes who constructed stone cliff dwellings. The departure of the Pueblo people around AD 1300 is widely believed to have resulted from changing climatic conditions, soil erosion, dwindling local resources, disease, and internal conflict. Present-day Hopi see these people as their ancestors. Beginning around AD 780, Hopi farmers settled here, followed by the Navajo around 1300. The Navajo migrated from far northern Canada; no one is sure when they first arrived in the Southwest. Despite evidence to the contrary, most Navajos hold that their people have always lived here and that the Diné passed through three previous underworlds before emerging into this, the fourth or Glittering World.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Within Monument Valley lies the 30,000-acre Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park, where eons of wind and rain have carved the mammoth red-sandstone monoliths into memorable formations. The monoliths, which jut hundreds of feet above the desert floor, stand on the horizon like sentinels, frozen in time and unencumbered by electric wires, telephone poles, or fences—a scene virtually unchanged for centuries. These are the very same nostalgic images so familiar to movie buffs who recall the early Western films of John Wayne. A 17-mi self-guided driving tour on an extremely rough dirt road (there\'s only one road, so you can\'t get lost) passes the memorable <b>Mittens</b> and <b>Totem Pole</b> formations, among others. Also be sure to walk (15 minutes round-trip) from North Window around the end of Cly Butte for the views.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Monument Valley Visitor Center</b> has an extensive crafts shop and exhibits devoted to ancient and modern Native American history. Most of the independent guided tours here use enclosed vans and charge about $20 to $25 for 2½ hours. You can generally find Navajo guides—who will escort you to places that you are not allowed to visit on your own—in the center or through the booths in the parking lot. In the fall of 2008 the tribe opened the handsome View Hotel just in time to celebrate the park\'s 50th anniversary. A full renovation and expasion of the visitor center is slated to open again by the end of 2009. Both the hotel and visitor center sit on a gradual rise overlooking the valley, with big-sky views in every direction.

On a smaller scale, it rivals the Grand Canyon for beauty. Its main gorges—the 26-mi-long Canyon de Chelly (\"canyon in the rock\") and the adjoining 35-mi Canyon del Muerto (\"canyon of the dead\")—comprise sheer, heavily eroded sandstone walls that rise to 1,100 feet over dramatic valleys. Ancient pictographs and petroglyphs decorate some of the cliffs, and within the canyon complex there are more than 7,000 archaeological sites. Stone walls rise hundreds of feet above streams, hogans, tilled fields, and sheep-grazing lands.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You can view prehistoric sites near the base of cliffs and perched on high, sheltering ledges, some of which you can access from the park\'s two main drives along the canyon rims. The dwellings and cultivated fields of the present-day Navajo lie in the flatlands between the cliffs, and those who inhabit the canyon today farm much the way their ancestors did. Most residents leave the canyon in winter but return in early spring to farm.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Canyon de Chelly\'s <b>South Rim Drive</b> (36 mi round-trip with seven overlooks) starts at the visitor center and ends at <b>Spider Rock Overlook,</b> where cliffs plunge 1,000 feet to the canyon floor. The view here is of two pinnacles, Speaking Rock and Spider Rock. Other highlights on the South Rim Drive are Junction Overlook, where Canyon del Muerto joins Canyon de Chelly; White House Overlook, from which a 2½-mi round-trip trail leads to the <b>White House Ruin,</b> with remains of nearly 60 rooms and several kivas; and Sliding House Overlook, where you can see dwellings on a narrow, sloped ledge across the canyon. The carved and sometimes narrow trail down the canyon side to White House Ruin is the only access into Canyon de Chelly without a guide—but if you have a fear of heights, this may not be the hike for you.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The only slightly less breathtaking <b>North Rim Drive</b> (34 mi round-trip with four overlooks) of Canyon del Muerto also begins at the visitor center and continues northeast on Indian Highway 64 toward the town of Tsaile. Major stops include Antelope House Overlook, a large site named for the animals painted on an adjacent cliff; the <b>Mummy Cave Overlook</b>, where two mummies were found inside a remarkably unspoiled pueblo dwelling; and <b>Massacre Cave Overlook</b>, which marks the spot where an estimated 115 Navajo were killed by the Spanish in 1805.

The largest ancient dwellings in Arizona, these stone-and-mortar complexes were built by Ancestral Puebloans, obviously for permanent occupancy, but abandoned after less than half a century.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The well-preserved, 135-room <b>Betatakin</b> (Navajo for \"ledge house\") is a cluster of cliff dwellings that seem to hang in midair before a sheer sandstone wall. When discovered in 1907 by a passing American rancher, the apartments were full of baskets, pottery, and preserved grains and ears of corn—as if the occupants had been chased away in the middle of a meal. For an impressive view of Betatakin, walk to the rim overlook about ½ mi from the visitor center. Ranger-led tours (a 5-mi, four-hour, strenuous round-trip hike including a 700-foot descent into the canyon) leave once a day from late May to early September at 8 AM and return between noon and 1 PM. No reservations are accepted; groups of no more than 25 form on a first-come, first-served basis.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Keet Seel</b> (Navajo for \"broken pottery\") is also in good condition in a serene location, with 160 rooms and five kivas. Explorations of Keet Seel, which lies at an elevation of 7,000 feet and is 8½ mi from the visitor center on foot, are restricted: only 20 people are allowed to visit per day, and only between late May and early September, when a ranger is present at the site. A permit—which also allows campers to stay overnight nearby—is required. Trips to Keet Seel are very popular, so reservations are taken up to two months in advance. Anyone who suffers from vertigo might want to avoid this trip: the trail leads down a 1,100-foot near-vertical rock face. www.nps.gov/nava. COST: Free.

Called one of the wonders of the Western world, the mountain deserves the title, though it has become an almost self-parodying icon, like the Eiffel Tower or the Empire State Building. Its peculiar snaggletooth form, free from competition from other peaks on all sides, rears up over the village, larger than life and genuinely awe-inspiring. As you leave the train station and weave through pedestrian crowds, aggressive electric taxi carts, and aromatic horse-drawn carriages along the main street, Bahnhofstrasse, you\'re assaulted on all sides by Matterhorn images—on postcards, sweatshirts, calendars, beer steins, and candy wrappers—though not by the original, which is obscured by resort buildings (except from the windows of pricier hotel rooms). But break past the shops and hotels onto the main road into the hills, and you\'ll reach a slightly elevated spot where you\'ll probably stop dead in your tracks. There it is at last, its twist of snowy rock blinding in the sun, weathered mazots scattered romantically at its base. Surely more pictures are taken from this spot than from anywhere else in Switzerland. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

An excellent swimming beach, it was named for a local tree whose bark has been used as a remedy for kidney ailments since ancient times. A short walk across the island, Playa Varadero hugs a rocky cove. Guides recommend snorkeling here, but watch for coral-covered rocks on both sides of the cove. Just behind is Playa Coral, whose calmer, crystal-clear water is more conducive to swimming. Each of the above beaches is lined with seafood eateries eager to rent snorkel equipment. Playa Carey, toward the island\'s south end, is small and has no services. Pangas ($4 round-trip) run between the boat landings at both Cuachalalate and Varadero beaches and Playa Linda on the mainland, where you\'ll find a few all-inclusive, high-rise hotels. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Playa la Ropa</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Clothing Beach apparently got its name hundreds of years ago when a textile-laden ship spilled its silks, which washed up on the sand. The area\'s most magnificent beach is a 20-minute walk from Playa la Madera and a five-minute taxi ride from town. Parasailers drift above the 1-km (½-mi) stretch of soft light sand; below, concessionaires rent Jet Skis ($40 for 30 minutes) and Hobie Cats (up to $50 an hour, depending on the size). Up and down the beach are open-air restaurants—some with hammocks for post-meal siestas—and a handful of hotels. Kids can splash in the calm, aquamarine water or toss a ball or Frisbee on the shore—but not too close to the little stream that empties into the southerly end: it\'s a crocodile refuge!

Some of the most rugged bush in the country is in Te Urewera National Park southeast of Rotorua, and hikes abound around Rotorua and Taupo. Just don\'t tackle the mountain terrain unprepared—the weather changes rapidly.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Maori Ceremonial Feast:</b> Rotorua may be the best place in New Zealand to try the Maori feast known as a <i>hangi.</i> Traditionally, the meal is made by lining a hangi pit, or earth oven, with heated stones and wet leaves, and then filling it with lamb, pork, chicken, seafood, potatoes, pumpkin, and <i>kumara</i> (sweet potato). Nowadays, the food may be prepared aboveground, but when it\'s done well, it doesn\'t lose much in the translation.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Soaking:</b> In Rotorua and Taupo, thermal springs are on tap. You can soak in your own thermal bath in even the cheapest hotels in Rotorua or take advantage of public facilities such as Polynesian Spa. Many Taupo hotels also have their own thermal baths or pools. Lie back and close your eyes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>World-Class Fishing:</b> Central North Island is trout country. You can get out on any of the designated lakes and waterways if you have your own gear and a fishing license—but a local guide can take you to the right spots. Anglers rarely leave Lake Taupo, the lakes around Rotorua, or the rivers farther south around Turangi disappointed.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Spellbound in Middle Earth</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Some of the most striking elements of the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> films weren\'t created by special-effects—they were the astonishing views of New Zealand\'s countryside. The film crew traveled all over the country, so there are dozens of locales to tempt you to stop and dream awhile.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the North Island, you can visit a handful of hobbit homes in rural Matamata (www.hobbitontours.com). The volcanic peaks and blasted terrain of Tongariro National Park provided the setting for Mordor. Tackle one of the park\'s walking trails to see the otherworldly hot springs, lava rocks, and craggy peaks like Ruapehu, the films\' Emyn Muil. Take the spectacular Tongariro Crossing trek to pass Ngauruhoe, the volcano the hobbits Frodo and Sam braved as Mount Doom.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Wellington, the film production\'s home base, is also the hometown of the director, Peter Jackson. Here the orcs, trolls, and the horrible Balrog all came to life, created by Weta Workshop and the production company Three Foot Six (named for the height of a hobbit). Weta\'s has had its hands full with other major films, including Jackson\'s <i>King Kong.</i> Local wags dub the capital \"Wellywood.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Hutt Valley, east of Wellington, saw plenty of hobbit action. During filming a huge polystyrene castle towered over a quarry by the Western Hutt road. Unsuspecting drivers would pass by Minas Tirith and the fortress of Isengard, where the wizard Gandalf was betrayed and imprisoned. Stay on Highway 2 to reach the beautiful Kaitoke Regional Park, used for the Elven city of Rivendell and a perfect place to picnic on the riverbank.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the South Island, Highway 6 unrolls south to glacier country.

Several local organizations offer the chance to try this slow-cooked treat, paired with a concert—an evening that may remind you of a Hawaiian lu\'au. Don\'t pass it up!</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As a <i>manuhiri</i> (guest), you\'ll get the full picture, beginning with a <i>powhiri,</i> the awe-inspiring Maori welcome that generally includes the <i>wero</i> (challenge), the <i>karanga</i> (cries of welcome), and the <i>hongi,</i> or pressing together of noses, an age-old Maori gesture that shows friendship. If you\'re not comfortable bouncing noses, a simple handshake will suffice.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While the food cooks, a show begins with haunting harmonious singing, foot stamping, and <i>poi</i> twirling (rhythmic swinging of balls on strings). The performance might raise the hair on the back of your neck—but this will be assuaged with food, glorious food. The lifting of the hangi will produce pork, sometimes lamb and chicken, and kumara (sweet potato), vegetables, and maybe fish and other seafood, followed by dessert.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Matariki Hangi and Concert</b>.

He was born at Matawhero, near Gisborne, in the early 19th century. As a young man he fought with government troops in a local uprising, but he was accused of treachery and deported without trial to the remote Chatham Islands in 1866. While detained on the island, he experienced visions and initiated a new creed he called Ringatu (\"raised hand,\" for the practice of raising the right hand after prayer). Ringatu is still practiced by several thousand people in New Zealand.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With his charismatic personality, Te Kooti became the de facto leader of the island\'s more than 200 prisoners. After two years he engineered their escape by capturing a ship and forcing the crew to sail them back to Poverty Bay. With arms seized from the ship, Te Kooti led his followers to the Urewera mountains, fighting off government troops as they went. In the years that followed, he was relentlessly hunted but continued to carry out vicious raids on coastal settlements. His last stand (and the last major engagement of the New Zealand wars) was at a fortified position at Te Porere, which you can still see near the road between Turangi and Te Urewera National Park. Te Kooti was defeated but escaped yet again. He eluded capture and spent the late 1870s in Te Kuiti, near Waitomo, under the protection of the Maori king. The government formally pardoned him in 1883; he died a decade later.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Hinemoa Legend</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the great Maori love stories has a special local connection, because it takes place on Mokoia Island in Lake Rotorua—and it\'s a true tale at that. Hinemoa, the daughter of an influential chief, lived on the lakeshore. Because of her father\'s status she was declared <i>puhi</i> (singled out to marry into another chief\'s family), and her tribal elders planned to choose her husband for her when she reached maturity. Although she had many suitors, none gained the approval of her tribe.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tutanekai was the youngest son of a family who lived on Mokoia Island. Each of his older brothers had sought the hand of Hinemoa, but none had been accepted. Tutanekai knew that because of his lowly rank he would never win approval from her family. But he was handsome and an excellent athlete—and eventually Hinemoa noticed him and fell in love.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the lakeshore, Hinemoa would hear Tutanekai play his flute, his longing music drifting across the water. Hinemoa\'s family, suspicious that their daughter would try to reach the island, beached their canoes so that she could not paddle across to Mokoia. The sound of Tutanekai\'s flute lured Hinemoa to try to swim to the island. After lashing gourds together to help her float, she slipped into the lake; guided by the music, she reached Mokoia. Cold and naked, she submerged herself in a hot pool, where she was discovered by Tutanekai. Enchanted, he slipped her into his home for the rest of the night. When they were discovered, Tutanekai\'s family feared an outbreak of war with Hinemoa\'s tribe, but instead the two tribes were peacefully united.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

A trio of active volcanoes dominates the park. Tongariro, the shortest and least active, has a heavily truncated cone; Ngauruhoe, a single-vent volcano, has a distinctively smooth cone shape. Ruapehu is the tallest (and at 9,175 feet, the highest mountain on the whole North Island), with a longer, irregular snow-topped profile and a large crater lake. It\'s also the most active of the three. Ruapehu erupted in 1995 and 1996, each time giving little warning before spewing forth ash and showers of rocks and unleashing lahars (the water of the crater lake churned with rock). Luckily, no one was hurt, though the eruptions occurred during ski season. When Ruapehu\'s crater lake fills up, there\'s a risk that another lahar will burst through the crater walls. A lahar in 1953 killed more than 150 people as the flood destroyed a railway bridge. This phenomena is now intensely monitored and a similar lahar in 2007, though spectacular, passed without danger to human life.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Tongariro\'s spectacular combination of dense <i>rimu</i> pine forests, crater lakes, barren lava fields, and birdlife makes it the most impressive and popular of the island\'s national parks. It has many hiking trails, the most famous of which is the <b>Tongariro Alpine Crossing,</b> a 16-km (10-mi) hike that traverses the mountain, passing craters and brilliantly colored lakes, and is generally considered one of the finest walks in the country. You need to be reasonably fit to tackle it, because there are steep inclines and the volcanic terrain can be punishing on a hot day, also the weather is notoriously fickle. Other hikes in the park range from multiday circuits to short treks of an hour or two.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Whakapapa Village,</b> on the north side of Ruapehu, is the only settlement within the national park with services and is the jump-off point for the Whakapapa ski slopes. The second ski area is Turoa, and its closest town is <b>Ohakune,</b> which is just beyond the southern boundary of the park—take Highway 49, which runs between Highways 1 and 4. Although ski season is the busiest time of year, these towns keep their doors open for hikers and other travelers when the snow melts. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Te Urewera National Park</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Te Urewera National Park is a vast, remote region of forests and lakes straddling the Huiarau Range. The park\'s outstanding feature is the glorious <b>Lake Waikaremoana</b> (\"sea of rippling waters\"), a forest-girded lake with good swimming, boating, and fishing. The lake is encircled by a 50-km (31-mi) walking track; the three- to four-day walk is popular, and in the summer months the lakeside hiking huts are heavily used. For information about this route, contact the <b>Department of Conservation Visitor Centre</b> (tel. 06/837-3803. www.doc.govt.nz) at Aniwaniwa, on the eastern arm of Lake Waikaremoana. The visitor center is also the site of a major modern artwork, the <i>Te Urewera</i> triptych by New Zealand artist Colin McCahon. The painting, done in 1976, shows a partial cross shape against a dark landscape, superimposed with English and Maori words and a reference to Te Kooti. The painting generated controversy, because a Pakeha (non-Maori) artist had incorporated Maori text, and in 1997 it was stolen (or liberated, depending on your point of view) in protest, resurfacing the following year. You can pick up walking leaflets and maps and ask advice about the walks in the park, such as the one to the <b>Aniwaniwa Falls</b> (30 minutes round-trip) or to <b>Lake Waikareiti</b> (five to six hours round-trip). The motor camp on the lakeshore, not far from the visitor center, has cabins, chalets, and motel units. In summer a launch operates sightseeing and fishing trips from the motor camp. There are areas of private Maori land within the park, so be sure to stay on marked paths. Access to the park is from Wairoa, 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Gisborne down Highway 2. It\'s then another 63 km (39 mi) from Wairoa along Highway 38 to Lake Waikaremoana. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cape Kidnappers</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Cape Kidnappers was named by Captain James Cook after local Maori tried to kidnap the servant of Cook\'s Tahitian interpreter. The cape is the site of a large <b>gannet colony.</b> The gannet is a large white seabird with black-tipped flight feathers, a golden crown, and wingspans that can reach 6 feet. When the birds find a shoal of fish, they fold their wings and plunge straight into the sea at tremendous speed. Their migratory pattern ranges from western Australia to the Chatham Islands, about 800 km (500 mi) east of Christchurch, but they generally nest only on remote islands. The colony at Cape Kidnappers is believed to be the only mainland gannet sanctuary in existence. Between October and March, about 15,000 gannets build their nests here, hatch their young, and prepare them for their long migratory flight.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You can walk to the sanctuary along the beach from Clifton, which is about 24 km (15 mi) south of Napier, but not at high tide. The 8-km (5-mi) walk must begin no earlier than three hours after the high-tide mark, and the return journey must begin no later than four hours before the next high tide. Tidal information is available at Clifton and at Napier Visitor Information Centre. A rest hut with refreshments is near the colony.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One easy way to get to the colony is to take a <b>Gannet Beach Adventures</b> (tel. 06/875-0898. www.gannets.com) tractor-trailer, which is pulled along the beach starting from Clifton Reserve, Clifton Beach. Tractors depart approximately two hours before low tide, and the trip ($33-$50)—with pick-ups from Napier, Hastings, and Havelock North—takes 4-4½ hours. If tides prevent the trip along the beach, the only other access is across private farmland. <b>Gannet Safaris</b> (tel. 06/875-0888) runs a four-wheel-drive bus to Cape Kidnappers from Summerlee Station, just past Te Awanga. A four-person minimum is required for this three-hour tour ($50 each). Advance booking is essential for all gannet colony tours. Both pick up by shuttle at an additional cost. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Go early or late to enjoy the solitude that comes from splashing or snorkeling among the rocks</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Vacation Villas:</b> Virgin Gorda villas come in all sizes and price ranges. Some are so spectacular they grace the pages of glossy magazines. These get top dollar, of course. Others are more modest, with prices that are comparable to what you\'d pay for a hotel room.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>North Sound:</b> Even if you aren\'t a guest at one of North Sound\'s handful of resorts, you still should visit. Ferries depart frequently for the short trip along the island\'s beautiful coastline.

El Greco\'s intensely individual and expressionist style—elongated and sometimes distorted figures, charged colors, and a haunting mysticism—was seen as strange and disturbing, and his work remained largely neglected until the late 19th century, when he found wide acclaim and joined the ranks of Velazquez and Goya as one of the old masters of Spanish painting.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Born Domenikos Theotokópoulos on the island of Crete, El Greco (\"The Greek\") received his artistic education and training in Italy, then moved to Spain around 1577, lured in part by the prospect of painting frescoes for the royal monastery of El Escorial. King Felipe II, however, rejected El Greco\'s work for being too unusual. It was in Toledo that El Greco came into his own, creating many of his greatest works and honing his singular style and unique vision. He remained here until his death in 1614.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The master painter immortalized the city and its citizens. In his masterpiece <i>The Burial of Count Orgaz,</i> which hangs in Toledo\'s Chapel of Santo Tomé, El Greco pays tribute to Toledan society. The burial onlookers, beneath a vibrant heaven full of angels, include many of El Greco\'s distinguished contemporaries, their white 16th-century ruff collars framing their angular, ascetic faces. Perhaps the most famous rendering of Toledo is El Greco\'s dramatic <i>View of Toledo,</i> in which the cityscape crackles with a sinister energy underneath a stormy sky.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The structure is a masterpiece itself, with playful, naturalistic detail. The facade is especially fantastic, with ribs in the form of cut-back trees, sprouting branches, and—to complete the forest motif—a row of wild men bearing mighty clubs. Across the walkway from the main museum is a Renaissance palace that houses temporary exhibitions. The main museum is arranged in rooms off an elaborate, arcaded courtyard. Its collections do for Spanish sculpture what those in the Prado do for Spanish painting—the only difference is that most people have heard of Velázquez, El Greco, and Goya, but fewer are familiar with Alonso de Berruguete, Juan de Juni, and Gregorio Fernández, the three artists represented here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Attendants and directional cues encourage you to tour the museum in chronological order. Begin on the ground floor, with Alonso de Berruguete\'s remarkable sculptures from the dismantled high altar in Valladolid\'s church of San Benito (1532). Berruguete, who trained in Italy under Michelangelo, is the most widely appreciated of Spain\'s postmedieval sculptors. He strove for pathos rather than realism, and his works have an extraordinarily expressive quality. The San Benito altar was the most important commission of his life, and the fragments here allow you to scrutinize his powerfully emotional art. In the museum\'s elegant chapel (which you normally see at the end of the tour) is a Berruguete retable from 1526, his first known work; on either side kneel gilded bronze figures by the Italian-born Pompeo Leoni.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Many critics of Spanish sculpture think that decline set in with the late-16th-century artist Juan de Juni, who used glass for eyes and pearls for tears. Juni\'s many admirers, however, find his works intensely exciting, and these pieces are, in any case, the highlights of the museum\'s upper floor. Dominating Castilian sculpture of the 17th century was Galician-born Gregorio Fernández, in whose works the dividing line between sculpture and theater becomes tenuous. Respect for Fernández has been diminished by the number of vulgar imitators his work has spawned, but at Valladolid you can see his art at its best. The enormous, dramatic, and moving sculptural groups assembled in the last series of rooms form a suitably spectacular climax to this fine collection. museoescultura.mcu.es.

Nearest the river stands the <b>Catedral Vieja</b> (Old Cathedral), built in the late 12th century, one of the most interesting examples of the Spanish Romanesque. Because the dome of the crossing tower has strange, plumelike ribbing, it\'s known as the Torre del Gallo (Rooster\'s Tower). The much larger <b>Catedral Nueva</b> (New Cathedral) dates mainly from the 16th century, though some parts, including the dome over the crossing and the bell tower attached to the west facade, had to be rebuilt after the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. Work began in 1513 under the direction of the distinguished late-Gothic architect Juan Gil de Hontañón, and as at Segovia\'s cathedral, Juan\'s son Rodrigo took over the work after his father\'s death in 1526. The New Cathedral\'s north facade (which contains the main entrance) is ornamental enough, but the west facade is dazzling in its sculptural complexity. Try to visit in late afternoon, when the sun shines on it.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The interior of the New Cathedral is as light and harmonious as that of Segovia\'s cathedral but larger. It\'s a triumphant baroque effusion designed by the Churrigueras. The wooden choir seems almost alive with active cherubim and saints. From a door in the south aisle, steps descend into the Old Cathedral, where boldly carved capitals supporting the vaulting are accented by foliage, strange animals, and touches of pure fantasy. Then comes the dome, which seems to owe much to Byzantine architecture; it\'s a remarkably light structure raised on two tiers of arcaded openings. Not the least of the Old Cathedral\'s attractions are its furnishings, including sepulchres from the 12th and 13th centuries and a curved high altar comprising 53 colorful and delicate scenes by the mid-15th-century artist Nicolás Florentino. In the apse above, Florentino painted an astonishingly fresh Last Judgment fresco.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the south transept of the Old Cathedral, a door leads into the cloister, begun in 1177. From about 1230 until the construction of the main university building in the early 15th century, the chapels around the cloister served as classrooms for the university students. In the Chapel of St. Barbara, on the eastern side, theology students answered the grueling questions meted out by their doctoral examiners. The chair in which they sat is still there, in front of a recumbent effigy of Bishop Juan Lucero, on whose head the students would place their feet for inspiration. Also attached to the cloister is a small cathedral museum with a 15th-century triptych of St. Catherine by Salamanca\'s greatest native artist, Fernando Gallego. www.catedralsalamanca.org.

Old Cathedral EUR 4.50, free Tues. 10-12. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Palacio Real de La Granja (Royal Palace of La Granja)</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While in the Segovia area, don\'t miss the Palacio Real de La Granja (Royal Palace of La Granja) in the town of La Granja de San Ildefonso, about 11 km (7 mi) southeast of Segovia (on N601) on the northern slopes of the Sierra de Guadarrama. The palace site was once occupied by a hunting lodge and a shrine to San Ildefonso, administered by Hieronymite monks from the Segovian monastery of El Parral. Commissioned by the Bourbon king Felipe V in 1719, the palace has been described as the first great building of the Spanish Bourbon dynasty. The Italian architects Juvarra and Sachetti, who finished it in 1739, were responsible for the imposing garden facade, a late-baroque masterpiece anchored throughout its length by a giant order of columns. The interior has been badly gutted by fire; the highlight is the collection of 15th- to 8th-century tapestries kept in a special museum. Even if you don\'t go into the palace, walking through the gardens is magnificent: terraces, ornamental ponds, lakes, classical statuary, woods, and baroque fountains dot the mountainside. On Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings in the summer (May-September, 6-7 PM), the fountains are turned on, one by one, creating an effect to rival that of Versailles. The starting time has been known to change on a whim, so call ahead. www.patrimonionacional.es. COST: Palace EUR 5, gardens free.

Projecting over the town\'s eastern precipice, these houses originally formed a 15th-century palace, which later served as a town hall before falling into disrepair in the 19th century. In 1927 the cantilevered balconies that had once hung over the gorge were rebuilt, and finally, in 1966, the painter Fernando Zóbel decided to create (inside the houses) the world\'s first museum devoted exclusively to abstract art. The works he gathered are almost all by the remarkable generation of Spanish artists who grew up in the 1950s and were essentially forced to live abroad during the Franco regime: the major names include Carlos Saura, Eduardo Chillida, Lucio Muñoz, Manuel Millares, Antoni Tàpies, and Zóbel himself. www.march.es/arte/cuenca/index.asp.

It\'s particularly important to call to confirm open information before settling the details of your trip. The region is best known for its outdoor activities, so these are the focus of many of the itineraries below.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Adirondacks are vast, so you should concentrate on one or two areas when planning a short visit. Here are three three-day plans.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The best time to visit <b>Lake George</b> is mid-June through early September, because many places are closed during the rest of the year. Start off in the southern gateway to the Adirondacks, <b>Glens Falls</b>, where you should make a point of seeing the Hyde Collection before continuing a few miles north to Lake George or <b>Bolton Landing</b>. Make Lake George your base if you\'re traveling with young children; opt for Bolton Landing if you\'re sans kiddies. Spend the first two days visiting attractions and water parks, relaxing at a beach, and cruising on the lake. If you\'re staying at a resort, leave time to take advantage of the recreational amenities. On Day 3, drive north on Route 9N to see the fort at <b>Ticonderoga</b> and then continue northward to see the ruins at <b>Crown Point</b>, taking in the scenery along the way.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The following two itineraries take you into the mountains. Visit the Hyde Collection in <b>Glens Falls</b> and then head northwest, via U.S. 9 and Route 28, to North Creek and the <b>Gore Mountain Ski Area</b>. Warm-weather activities include visiting a garnet mine, taking a scenic railroad trip, mountain biking, hiking, white-water rafting, and canoeing. On either Day 2 or 3 take a side trip to the must-see Adirondack Museum in <b>Blue Mountain Lake</b> and Great Camp Sagamore, in Raquette Lake. Winter options center on snow: downhill and cross-country skiing and snowshoeing.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The <b>Lake Placid</b> area is also sports-focused. In this option you use Lake Placid or the <b>Whiteface Mountain Ski Area</b> in nearby Wilmington as your base for both nights. Take in the Olympic sites on Day 1 and spend the afternoon and evening checking out the shops and restaurants in Lake Placid. Get ready for some action on Day 2. Ice-skating, downhill and cross-country skiing, snowboarding, tobogganing, bobsledding, and snowshoeing are among the winter activities; summer and early-fall diversions include hiking, golf, fly-fishing, mountain biking, and lake cruising. Youngsters might enjoy visiting Santa\'s Workshop in the village of North Pole. On Day 3 (mid-May to mid-October), follow Route 86 northeast to Route 9N and take that to the spectacular <b>Ausable Chasm</b>.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 6 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">With six days, you can combine elements of and build on the three-day itineraries above.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In summer follow the <b>Lake George</b> itinerary above, stopping in <b>Glens Falls</b> to see the Hyde Collection first. On Day 3 drive north on Route 9N to see the fort at <b>Ticonderoga</b><i>or, </i> farther north, the ruins at <b>Crown Point</b>. Continue north on 9N and then follow it west from Westport toward Keene. You pass through Elizabethtown, home of the quirky Adirondack History Center, which is worth a visit. From Keene take Route 73 into <b>Lake Placid</b>, where you spend the next two nights. Spend Day 4 in the great outdoors—here and in nearby Wilmington and the <b>Whiteface Mountain Ski Area</b> —and poke around Lake Placid in the afternoon and evening. Devote Day 5 to seeing the Olympic sites. On Day 6, follow Route 86 northeast to Route 9N and take that to the spectacular <b>Ausable Chasm</b>.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Another way to see the Adirondacks is to start in <b>Ausable Chasm</b> and then take Route 9N and Route 86 southwest into <b>Lake Placid</b>, where you spend the first three nights. (Or consider overnighting in <b>Whiteface Mountain Ski Area</b> in nearby Wilmington instead.) Spend Days 2 and 3 checking out the Olympic venues and playing outside. On Day 4 switch to great-camps mode. Pick a lodging in either <b>Saranac Lake</b> or <b>Tupper Lake</b> for your fourth and fifth nights. The former is closer to the famed St. Regis Wilderness Canoe Area, which includes part of Upper Saranac Lake and stretches northwest. Devote Day 5 to a canoe trip. If you\'re not staying at an old camp, schedule a tour of the White Pine Camp in Paul Smiths for Day 4 or Day 6. If you have time and are heading south to go home, detour to the Adirondack Museum, in <b>Blue Mountain Lake</b>. In winter you\'ll have to skip Ausable Chasm, the canoeing, and the Blue Mountain Lake detour and focus on winter sports.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pleasures & Pastimes</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Canoeing</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The vast network of rivers and lakes in the North Country makes canoeing one of the best ways to experience the outdoors here. Trips of 100 mi or more are possible, as are short day trips geared for beginners. One of the best places for canoeing in the Adirondacks is the St. Regis Canoe Area, west of Saranac Lake, where powerboats are prohibited. To the southwest, between Old Forge and Raquette Lake, is the 16-mi Fulton Chain of Lakes, also popular with canoeists. A 1-mi portage links this eight-lake cluster (from Eighth Lake) to Raquette Lake, from which you may paddle north.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hiking</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hiking is the simplest and one of the best ways to experience the North Country outdoors. Most trails are well maintained and marked by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and many trailheads are along the major routes through the Adirondack area—including Route 28N between North Creek and Long Lake and Route 73 between Lake Placid and Keene.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most popular—and congested—area for hiking is the High Peaks region, accessible from the Lake Placid area in the north, Keene in the east, and Newcomb in the south. Much ado is made of the so-called Adirondack \"46ers\"—the people who have ascended the 46 highest peaks in the region. Although the High Peaks area tends to draw the most attention, this is where you find the most rugged hiking. Many less strenuous climbs and hikes offer rewarding views and backwoods experiences, whether for half-day hikes, full-day outings, or multiday backpacking trips. The areas around Schroon Lake, for example, have good hiking with minimal climbing.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Winter Sports</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You may see Olympic-caliber athletes in a variety of sports training in and around Lake Placid, which was the site of the 1980 Winter Olympics. National and international competitions in bobsledding and luge are held at Mount Van Hoevenberg, alpine racing and freestyle competition at Whiteface Mountain, and speed skating at the Sheffield Speed Skating Oval in the center of Lake Placid. Hockey and figure-skating competitions are held in the ice arena next door to the Olympic oval. But you don\'t have to spend all your time on the sidelines. You might strap on some skates and take a spin on the speed-skating oval or the indoor ice arena; shoot down an old ski slide in a toboggan; or hurtle down a bobsled run. Go downhill skiing at Whiteface, the largest alpine resort in the North Country, or cover a few miles on cross-country skis at Mount Van Hoevenberg. Head to the southeastern part of Adirondack Park for the Gore Mountain Ski Center, a Whiteface sibling with a 2,100-foot vertical drop, and the Garnet Hill Cross-Country Ski Center.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The two canyons, commonly called Big Petroglyph and Little Petroglyph, are in the Coso Mountain Range on the million-acre U.S. Naval Weapons Center at China Lake. Each of the canyons holds a superlative concentration of ancient rock art, the largest of its kind in the Northern Hemisphere. Thousands of well-preserved images of animals and humans—some more than 16,000 years old—are scratched or pecked into dark basaltic rocks. The tour takes you through 3 mi of sandy washes and boulders, so wear comfortable walking shoes. At an elevation of 5,000 feet, weather conditions can be quite extreme, so dress in layers and bring plenty of drinking water (none is available at the site) and snacks. Children under 10 are not allowed on the tour. The military requires everyone to produce a valid driver\'s license, Social Security number, passport, and vehicle registration before the trip (nondrivers must provide a birth certificate). </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Calico Ghost Town</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Calico Ghost Town was once a wild and wealthy mining town. In 1881 prospectors found a rich deposit of silver in the area, and by 1886 more than $85 million worth of silver, gold, and other precious metals had been harvested from the surrounding hills. Once the price of silver fell, though, the town slipped into decline. Many buildings here are authentic, but the restoration has created a theme-park version of the 1880s. You can stroll the wooden sidewalks of Main Street, browse shops filled with Western goods, roam the tunnels of Maggie\'s Mine, and take a ride on the Calico-Odessa Railroad. Festivals in March, May, October, and November celebrate Calico\'s Wild West theme. www.calicotown.com. COST: $6. OPEN: Daily 9-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Havasu National Wildlife Refuge</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1941, after the construction of Parker Dam, President Franklin D. Roosevelt set aside Havasu National Wildlife Refuge, a 24-mi stretch of land along the Colorado River between Needles and Lake Havasu City. Best seen by boat, this beautiful waterway is punctuated with isolated coves, sandy beaches, and Topock Marsh, a favorite nesting site of herons, egrets, and other waterbirds. You can see wonderful petroglyphs on the rocky red canyon cliffs of Topock Gorge. The park has 11 access points, including boat launches at Catfish Paradise, Five Mile Landing, and Pintail Slough. There\'s camping below Castle Rock. www.fws.gov/southwest/refuges/arizona/havasu. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

However, this scenario is likely only during the peak months of mid-May through mid-October. One option is to bypass Grand Canyon National Park altogether and head to the West Rim of the canyon, tribal land of the Hualapai and Havasupai. If only the park itself will do, the following tips will help you to keep your distance and your cool.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Take Another Route</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Avoid road rage by choosing a different route to the South Rim, foregoing the traditional highways 64 and U.S. 180 from Flagstaff. Take U.S. 89 north from Flagstaff instead, passing near Sunset Crater and Wupatki national monuments. When you reach the Cameron Trading Post at the junction with Highway 64, take a break—or stay overnight. This is a good place to shop for Native American artifacts, souvenirs, and the usual postcards, dream-catchers, recordings, and T-shirts. There are also high-quality Navajo rugs, jewelry, and other authentic handicrafts, and you can sample Navajo tacos. U.S. 64 to the west takes you directly to the park\'s east entrance; the scenery along the Little Colorado River Gorge en route is eye-popping. It\'s 23 mi from the east entrance to the visitor center at Canyon View Information Plaza.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bypass the South Rim</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Although the North Rim is just 10 mi across from the South Rim, the trip to get there by car is a five-hour drive of 215 mi. At first it might not sound like the trip would be worth it, but the payoff is huge. Along the way, you will travel through some of the prettiest parts of the state and be granted even more stunning views than those on the more easily accessible South Rim. Those who make the North Rim trip often insist it offers the canyon\'s most beautiful views and best hiking. To get to the North Rim from Flagstaff, take U.S. 89 north past Cameron, turning left onto U.S. 89A at Bitter Springs. En route you\'ll pass the area known as Vermilion Cliffs. At Jacob Lake, take Highway 67 directly to the Grand Canyon North Rim. The road to the North Rim closes from around mid-October through mid-May because of heavy snow, but in summer months and early fall, it\'s a wonderful way to beat the crowds at the South Rim.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Ride the Rails</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There is no need to deal with all of the other drivers racing to the South Rim. Forget the hassle of the twisting rim roads, jaywalking pedestrians, and jammed parking lots, and sit back and relax in the comfy train cars of the <b>Grand Canyon Railway</b>. Live music and storytelling enliven the trip as you journey past the landscape through prairie, ranch, and national park land to the log-cabin train station in Grand Canyon Village. You won\'t see the Grand Canyon from the train, but you can walk or catch the shuttle at the restored, historic Grand Canyon Railway Station. The vintage train departs from the Williams Depot every morning, and makes the 65-mi journey in 2¼ hours. You can do the round-trip in a single day; however, you may choose to stay overnight at the South Rim and return to Williams the following afternoon. tel. 800/843-8724. www.thetrain.com. COST: $70-$190 round-trip.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Flora and Fauna of the Grand Canyon</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Eighty-nine mammal species inhabit Grand Canyon National Park, as well as 355 species of birds and 56 kinds of reptiles and amphibians, and 17 kinds of fish. The rare Kaibab squirrel is found only on the North Rim—you can recognize them by their all-white tails and the long tufts of white hair on their ears. The pink Grand Canyon rattlesnake lives at lower elevations within the canyon. Hawks and ravens are visible year-round. The endangered California condor has been reintroduced to the canyon. Park rangers give daily talks on the magnificent birds, whose wingspan measures 9 feet. In spring, summer, and fall, mule deer, recognizable by their large antlers, are abundant at the South Rim. Don\'t be fooled by gentle appearances; these guys can be aggressive. It\'s illegal to feed them, as it will disrupt their natural habitats, and increase your risk of getting bitten.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The best times to see wildlife are early in the morning and late in the afternoon. Look for out-of-place shapes and motions, keeping in mind that animals occupy all layers in a natural habitat and not just at your eye level. Use binoculars for close-up views. While out and about try to fade into the woodwork by keeping your movements limited and noise at a minimum.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">More than 1,700 species of plants color the park. The South Rim\'s Coconino Plateau is fairly flat, at an elevation of about 7,000 feet, and covered with stands of piñon and ponderosa pines, junipers, and Gambel\'s oak trees. On the Kaibab Plateau on the North Rim, Douglas fir, spruce, quaking aspen, and more ponderosas prevail. In spring you\'re likely to see asters, sunflowers, and lupine in bloom at both rims.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">White-Water Rafting at the Grand Canyon</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">So you\'re ready to tackle the churning white water of the Colorado River as it rumbles and hisses its way through the Grand Canyon? Well, you\'re in good company: the crafty, one-armed Civil War veteran John Wesley Powell first charted these dangerous rapids during the summer of 1869. It wasn\'t until 1938, though, that the first commercial river trip made its way down this fearsome corridor. Running the river has come a long way since then—and since Norman Neville made the first trip by kayak, in 1941, in a craft he built out of scrap lumber, partly salvaged from an outhouse.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Before You Go</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Keep in mind that seats fill up fast due to the restricted number of visitors allowed on the river each season by the National Park Service. Due to the limited availability, reservations for multiday trips should be made a year or two in advance. Once you\'ve secured your seat, all that\'s left to do is pack your bags and get geared up for an experience of a lifetime. Lots of people book trips for summer\'s peak period: June through August. If you\'re flexible, take advantage of the Arizona weather; May to early June and September are ideal rafting times in the Grand Canyon.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">What to Expect</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">White-water rafting still offers all the excitement of those early days—without the danger and discomfort. Most trips begin at Lees Ferry, a few miles below the Glen Canyon Dam near Page. There are tranquil half- and full-day float trips from the Glen Canyon Dam to Lees Ferry, as well as raft trips that run from three to 18 days. The shorter three- and four-day voyages either begin or end at Phantom Ranch at the bottom of the Grand Canyon at river mile 87. On the longer trips, you\'ll encounter the best of the canyon\'s white water along the way, including Lava Falls, listed in the <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> as \"the fastest navigable white water stretch in North America.\"</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Life jackets, beverages, tents, sheets, tarps, sleeping bags, dry bags, first aid, and food are provided—but you\'ll still need to plan ahead by packing clothing, a rain suit, hats, sunscreen, toiletries, and other sundries. Commercial outfitters allow each river runner two waterproof bags to store items during the day. Just keep in mind that one of the bags will be filled up with the provided sleeping bag and tarp, which only leaves one for your personal belongings.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While most people band together as a group, there is still plenty of open space for solitude. After the first night, most rafters give up on pitching tents and spread their sleeping bags under the stars.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Word of Mouth</h2><p /><div class=\"WorldGuide\">\"If you are the slightest bit adventurous. a rafting trip in the Grand Canyon is the TRIP OF A LIFETIME!\"—canyonwren</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">\"Basically there are three things going on down there—a great geology lesson with incredible scenery, daily side-hikes up beautiful side-canyons that are each unique, and some of the most thrilling and exciting white-water in the USA with numerous big rapids and five real thumpers.\"—Bill_H</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Appropriately, this is one of the best locations on the South Rim to watch the sunset. Dominated by the Yavapai Observation Station, this point offers panoramic views of the mighty gorge through a wall of windows. Exhibits showcased here include videos of the canyon floor and the Colorado River, a scaled diorama of the canyon with national park boundaries, fossils and rock fragments used to re-create the complex layers of the canyon walls, and a display on the natural forces used to carve the chasm. Rangers dig even deeper into Grand Canyon geology with the free ranger program Geo-Glimpse, offered twice daily. A guided afternoon nature walk completes the offerings. Check ahead for special event and walk schedules. COST: Free. OPEN: Daily 8-8, hrs vary in winter. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Point Sublime</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Talk about solitude. Here you can camp within feet of the canyon\'s edge. Sunrises and sunsets are spectacular. The winding road, through gorgeous high country, is only 17 mi, but it will take you at least two hours, one way. The road is intended only for vehicles with high-road clearance (pickups and four-wheel-drive vehicles). It is also necessary to be properly equipped for wilderness road travel. Check with a park ranger or at the information desk at Grand Canyon Lodge before taking this journey. You may camp here only with a permit from the Backcountry Office. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Choose from among more than 40 fitness classes per day, plus lifestyle management workshops and private consultations with wellness experts in the field of medicine, nutrition, behavior, and physiology.

Founded in 1983 by author Barry Neil Kaufman (<i>Happiness is a Choice</i> and Samahria Lyte Kaufman, the Option Institute is based on the premise that emotions like misery, fear, anger, and distress are optional, not inevitable. Personal growth workshops are designed to help participants develop tools that will improve the quality of their relationships, which leads to a happier life. \"Energizing\" and \"empowering\" are words used by happy fans to describe their experience with the Option Institute.

The nearest airport is in Midland, 3½ hours north of the park. The bus takes you as far as Marathon, and the train as far as Alpine.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Paved park roads have twists and turns, some very extreme in higher elevations; RVs and trailers longer than 20 feet should avoid the Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive on the park\'s west side and the Chisos Basin Road into higher elevations in Big Bend\'s central portion. Four-wheel-drive vehicles are needed for many of the backcountry roads. At parking areas take valuables with you.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Flora & Fauna</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Because Big Bend contains habitats as diverse as spent volcanoes, slick-sided canyons, and the Rio Grande, it follows that species here are extremely diverse, too. Among the park\'s most notable residents are endangered species like the agave cactus-eating Mexican long-nosed bat, shadow-dappled peregrine falcon, and fat-bellied horned lizard (Texans call them \"horney toads\"). More than 400 species of birds wing throughout the park, including the black-capped vireo and the turkey vulture, which boasts a 6-foot wingspan.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In the highlands several dozen mountain lions lurk, while black bears loll in the crags and valleys. Your chances of spotting the reclusive creatures are rare, though greater in the early morning. If you do encounter either, don\'t run away. Instead, stand tall, shout, and look as scary as possible.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If the winged, furred, and legged denizens of Big Bend are watch-worthy, so, too, are the plants populating the region. Supremely adapted to the arroyos, valleys, and slopes, the plants range from the brightly colored hedgehog cactus (found only in the Chisos) to the towering rasp of the giant dagger yucca. Also here are 65 types of cacti—so be careful where you tread.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

With some of the clearest skies anywhere, the park offers views that, on a clear day, extend 200 mi and into three states.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Spectacular Sunrises &amp; Sunsets:</b> The deep orange and crimson hues of the park\'s hoodoos are intensified by the light of the sun at either end of the day.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Getting into the Zone(s):</b> Bryce Canyon\'s elevation range—2,000 feet—is such that it spans three climatic zones: spruce/fir forest, ponderosa pine forest, and pinyon pine/juniper forest. The result is a park rich in biodiversity.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Gaspworthy Geology:</b> A series of horseshoe-shaped amphitheaters comprise much of the park, and are the focus of most scenic turnouts.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Getting There & Around</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The closest major cities to Bryce Canyon are Salt Lake City and Las Vegas, each about 270 mi away. The nearest commercial airport is 80 mi west in Cedar City, Utah. The park is reached via Route 63, just 3 mi south of the junction with Highway 12.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You can see the park\'s highlights by driving along the well-maintained road running the length of the main scenic area. Bryce has no restrictions on automobiles, but in the summer you may encounter heavy traffic and full parking lots. A shuttle bus system operates from mid-May through September. It is free, though you still must pay the park entrance fee. The shuttle departs from the staging area off Highway 12 about 3 mi north of the park entrance every 10 to 15 minutes. Stops include Best Western Ruby\'s Inn, the North Campground, the visitor center, and all major overlooks in the northern portion of the park.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bryce Canyon in One Day</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Begin your day at the <b>visitor center</b> to get an overview of the park and to purchase books and maps. Watch the video and peruse exhibits about the natural and cultural history of Bryce Canyon. Thus informed, drive to the historic <b>Bryce Canyon National Park Lodge.</b> From here, stroll along the relaxing <b>Rim Trail.</b> Afterward, drive the 18-mi <b>Main Park Road</b><b>,</b> stopping at the overlooks along the way. Allowing for traffic, and if you stop at all 13 overlooks, this drive will take you between two and three hours.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you have the time and energy for a hike, the easiest route into the amphitheater is the <b>Queen\'s Garden Trail</b> at Sunrise Point. A short, rolling hike along the <b>Bristlecone Loop Trail</b> at Rainbow Point rewards you with spectacular views and a cool walk through a forest of bristlecone pines. If you don\'t have time to drive the 18 mi to the end of the park, skip Bryce Canyon National Park Lodge and drive 2 mi from the visitor center to <b>Inspiration Point</b> and the next 2 mi to <b>Bryce Point.</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">End your day with sunset at Inspiration Point and dinner at Bryce Canyon National Park Lodge (you\'ll want to have made your reservations that morning). As you leave the park, stop at <b>Ruby\'s Inn</b> for Native American jewelry, souvenirs for the kids, and snacks for the road.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Flora & Fauna</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Due to elevations approaching 9,000 feet, many of Bryce Canyon\'s 400 plant species are unlike those you\'ll see at less lofty places. Look at exposed slopes and you might catch a glimpse of the gnarled, 2,000-year-old bristlecone pine. More common, and far younger, are the Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, and the quaking aspen, most striking in its bright golden fall color. No fewer than three kinds of sagebrush—big, black, and fringed—grow here, as well as the blue columbine.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Their reputation as a pest among Southern Utah ranchers notwithstanding, the Utah prairie dog is designated a threatened species. Be cautious around them. Though cute and seemingly approachable, they might bite if you get too close, and the bacteria that causes bubonic plague has been found on their fleas. Other animals include elk, black-tailed jackrabbits, and the desert cottontail. Below 7,000 feet, black bear have been seen in the trees, but infrequently. It\'s far more likely you\'ll see the soaring forms of golden and bald eagles, or perhaps a peregrine falcon diving into the amphitheaters at speeds approaching 200 mph.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Allow two to three hours to travel the entire 36 mi round-trip. The road is open year-round, but may be closed temporarily after heavy snowfalls to allow for clearing. Major overlooks are rarely more than a few minutes\' walk from the parking areas, and many let you see more than 100 mi on clear days. All overlooks lie east of the road—to keep things simple (and left turns to a minimum), you can proceed to the southern end of the park and stop at the overlooks on your northbound return. Trailers are not allowed beyond Sunset Campground. Day users may park trailers at the visitor center or other designated sites; check with park staff for parking options. RVs can drive throughout the park, but vehicles longer than 25 feet are not allowed at Paria View. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The nearest airport is Grand County Airport, also know as Canyonlands Field (435/259-7419), 18 mi north of Moab. Flights are very limited. The nearest train \"station\" is a solitary Amtrak stop in Green River, about 60 mi northwest of Moab. For train inquiries, call Amtrak (800/872-7245).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Before starting a journey to any of Canyonlands\' three districts, make sure your gas tank is topped off, as there are no services inside the large park. Island in the Sky is 32 mi from Moab, Needles District is 80 mi from Moab, and the Maze is more than 100 mi from Moab. The Island in the Sky road from the district entrance to Grand View Point is 12 mi, with one 5-mi spur to Upheaval Dome. The Needles scenic drive is 10 mi with two spurs about 3 mi each. Roads in the Maze, suitable only for rugged, high-clearance, four-wheel-drive vehicles, wind for hundreds of miles through the canyons. Within the parks, safety and courtesy mandate that you always park only in designated pullouts or parking areas.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Flora & Fauna</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Your chances of seeing wildlife are fairly good in Canyonlands because there are fewer people and less traffic to scare the animals away. Cool mornings and evenings are the best time to spot them, especially during the summer when the heat keeps them in cool, shady areas. Mule deer are nearly always seen along the roadway as you enter the Needles District, and you\'ll no doubt see jackrabbits and small rodents darting across the roadway. Approximately 250 bighorns populate the park in the Island in the Sky District, and the Maze shelters about 100 more. If you happen upon one of these regal animals, do not approach it even if it is alone, as bighorn sheep are skittish by nature and easily stressed. Also, report your sighting to a ranger.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Start your journey at the <b>visitor center</b><b>,</b> where you can study a three-dimensional map of the area, watch the short slide show, and browse the many books and maps related to the park. Then head for the park\'s scenic drive, stopping at the <b>Fruita Historic District</b> to see some of the sites associated with the park\'s Mormon history. Stop at the <b>Historic Gifford Farmhouse</b> for a tour and a visit to the gift shop. As you continue on with your tour, check out the <b>Fremont Indian Petroglyphs,</b> and if you feel like some exertion, take a hike on the Hickman Bridge Trail. Next you\'ll have to backtrack a few miles on Highway 24 to find the <b>Goosenecks Trail</b><b>.</b> At the same parking lot you\'ll find the trailhead for <b>Sunset Point Trail</b>; take this short hike in time to watch the setting sun hit the colorful cliffs.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Getting There & Around</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Though far from big cities, there are a variety of approaches to Capitol Reef country. The main high-speed arteries through the region are Interstates 70 and 15, but any route will require travel of some secondary roads such as U.S. 50, U.S. 89, Highway 24, or Route 72. All are well-maintained, safe roads that bisect rich agricultural communities steeped in Mormon history (such as the nearby towns of Bicknell and Loa). Interstate 15 is the fastest way through central Utah, but U.S. 89 and the local roads that feed onto it will give you a more direct path into Utah\'s past and present-day character. Highway 24 runs across the middle of Capitol Reef National Park, so even those traveling between points west and east of the park with no intention of touring the park get a scenic treat on their way. Once inside the park, there is no shuttle service like at nearby Zion and Bryce Canyon national parks.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Flora & Fauna</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The golden rock and rainbow cliffs are at their finest at sunset, when it seems as if they are lighted from within. That\'s also when mule deer wander through the orchards near the campground. The deer are quite tame, but do not feed them; their digestive systems are harmed by people food. Many of the park\'s animals move about only at night to escape the heat of the day, but pinyon jays and black-billed magpies flit around the park all day. The best place to see wildlife is near the Fremont River, where animals are drawn to drink. Ducks and small mammals such as the yellow-bellied marmot live nearby. Desert bighorn sheep also live in Capitol Reef, but they are elusive. Your best chance of spotting the sheep is during a long hike deep within the park. If you should encounter a sheep, do not approach it, as they\'ve been known to charge human beings.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Capitol Reef\'s <b>fruit orchards</b> (Scenic Dr., less than 1 mi from visitor center) are still lovingly maintained by the National Park Service.

Several rooms in the restored house are furnished with period furniture and housewares. The former kitchen has been converted to a gift shop. It\'s open daily from 11 to 5.

For travelers who can\'t fathom Florida without Walt Disney World, the final answer is \"d\"—at least Central Florida. The theme park\'s arrival spawned a multibillion-dollar tourism industry that begat a population boom that begat new roads, malls, and schools that begat a whole new culture.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">So how did it happen? Why did Walt pin his hopes on forlorn Florida ranchlands 3,000-mi from Disneyland? In the 1950s, Walt barely had enough money to open his theme park in California, and lacking the funds to buy a buffer zone, he couldn\'t prevent cheap hotels and tourist traps from setting up shop next door. This time he wanted land. And lots of it. Beginning in the early 1960s, Walt embarked on a super-secret four-year project: he traveled the nation in search of a location with access to a major population center, good highways, a steady climate, and, most important, cheap and abundant land. Locations were narrowed down and, in the end, Orlando was it.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In May 1965, major land transactions were being recorded a few miles southwest of Orlando. By late June, the <i>Orlando Sentinel</i> reported that more than 27,000 acres had been sold so far. In October, the paper revealed that Walt was the mastermind behind the purchases. Walt and his brother Roy hastily arranged a press conference. Once Walt described the $400 million project and the few thousand jobs it would create, Florida\'s government quickly gave him permission to establish the autonomous Reedy Creek Improvement District. With this, he could write his own zoning restrictions and plan his own roads, bridges, hotels—even a residential community for his employees.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Walt played a hands-on role in the planning of Disney World, but just over a year later, in December 1966, he died. As expected, his faithful brother Roy took control and spent the following five years supervising the construction of the Magic Kingdom. Fittingly, before the park opened on October 1, 1971, Roy changed the name of his brother\'s park to \"Walt\" Disney World. Roy passed away three months after the park\'s opening, but by then WDW was hitting its stride. For the next decade, it became part of Florida\'s landscape. Families that once saw Orlando merely as a whistle-stop on the way to Miami now made their vacation base at WDW.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Behind the scenes, however, a few cracks began to appear in the facade. In its first decade, growth was stagnant. By 1982, when Epcot opened, construction-cost overruns and low attendance created a 19% drop in profits. Meanwhile, the Disney Channel and Disney\'s film division were also sluggish. Eventually, in 1984, Michael Eisner came aboard as CEO and company chairman, along with Frank Wells as president and CFO. Their arrival got Disney out of the doldrums. Disney\'s unparalleled film catalog was brought out of storage with rereleases in theaters and on video. Jeffrey Katzenberg was put in charge of the Disney Studios, and with him came the release of \"new classics\" such as <i>Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid,</i> and <i>The Lion King.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1988 the Grand Floridian and Caribbean Beach resorts opened. The following year Disney-MGM Studios (now Disney\'s Hollywood Studios) opened along with Typhoon Lagoon and the ever-evolving Pleasure Island. Five resort hotels opened in the early 1990s. By 1997 Blizzard Beach, ESPN Wide World of Sports, and Downtown Disney West Side had opened; and by 1998 Disney\'s Animal Kingdom had come to life. Also arriving in this decade of growth were the planned community of Celebration, Disney Cruise Line, the book-publishing arm of Hyperion, and the purchase of Miramax Films and ABC television.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Since the profitable mid-1990s, however, Disney has suffered its share of economic trouble and political unrest. Following a dip in earnings in 2002, and several box-office bombs (think: <i>The Alamo</i>), Roy E. Disney, Walt\'s nephew, resigned from his position as vice chairman of the board of directors to lead a movement to oust Michael Eisner from the company. When Eisner came up for re-election to the Disney board in early 2004, 43% of shareholders withheld their votes. By September 2005, Robert Iger had replaced Eisner as CEO. Despite the big changes at its parent company, Walt Disney World continues to grow and improve. A score of new shows and attractions opened in 2006, 2007, and 2008, including the exciting \"runaway train\" ride Expedition Everest, the brilliant \"Finding Nemo—The Musical,\" Monsters, Inc. Laugh Floor, and Toy Story Mania! Disney has also tapped into the concept of special yearlong celebrations that give you a reason to return.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Also, the next time you put Disney on your vacation schedule, consider setting your sights on the coast. In 2011 and 2012, the impressively successful Disney Cruise Line will christen two new super ships.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">And it all started with a man who didn\'t have the cash to buy a little more land in Anaheim.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">-Gary McKechnie</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The train rushes and rattles past 20 Audio-Animatronics figures—including donkeys, chickens, a goat, and a grizzled old miner surprised in his bathtub—as well as $300,000 worth of genuine antique mining equipment, tumbleweeds, a derelict mining town, hot springs, and a flash flood.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The ride was 15 years in the planning and took two years and close to $17 million to build. This 1979 price tag, give or take a few million, equaled the entire cost of erecting California\'s Disneyland in 1955. The 197-foot mountain landscape is based on the wind-swept scenery of Arizona\'s Monument Valley, and thanks to 650 tons of steel, 4,675 tons of concrete, and 16,000 gallons of paint, it replicates the area\'s gorges, tunnels, caverns, and dry river beds. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Honey, I Shrunk the Audience</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Duration:</b> 14 min.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Crowds:</b> Large theater capacity should mean a relatively short wait, but the film\'s popularity can make for big crowds.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Strategy:</b> Go first thing in the morning or just before closing, or utilize Fastpass.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Audience:</b> All but easily frightened children.

While Dr. Szalinski is demonstrating his latest shrinking machine, though, things go wrong. Be prepared to laugh and scream your head off, courtesy of the special in-theater effects and 3-D film technology that are used ingeniously, from start to finish, to dramatize a hoot of a story. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Duration:</b> 13 min.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Crowds:</b> Heavy.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Strategy:</b> For best views (and if you have young children), find your place 45 min in advance.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Audience:</b> All ages.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Rating:</b> ***</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The marvelous nighttime spectacular takes place over the World Showcase Lagoon every night before closing. Be sure to stick around for the lasers, lights, fireworks, fountains, and music that fill the air over the water. Although there\'s generally good viewing from all around the lagoon, some of the best spots are in front of the Italy pavilion, on the bridge between France and the United Kingdom, on the promenade in front of Canada, at the World Showcase Plaza, and on the bridge between China and Germany, which will give you a clear shot, unobstructed by trees. After the show, concealed loudspeakers play the theme music manipulated into salsa, polka, waltz, and even—believe it or not—Asian rhythms. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Mickey\'s PhilharMagic</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Duration:</b> 12 min.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Crowds:</b> Heavy.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Strategy:</b> You could grab a Fastpass, but they\'re probably better spent on Pooh and Peter Pan.

As you settle into your theater seat, the on-screen action takes you behind the curtains at a grand concert hall where Donald and Mickey are preparing for a musical performance. But when Donald misuses Mickey\'s magical sorcerer\'s hat, he suddenly finds himself on a whirlwind journey that includes a magic carpet ride and an electrifying dip under the sea. And you go along for the ride. On the way you meet favorite Disney characters including Ariel, Simba, Aladdin, and Jasmine, and Peter Pan and Tinker Bell. The film startles with its special-effects technology—you\'ll smell a fresh-baked apple pie, feel the rush of air as champagne corks pop, and get lost in the action on one of the largest screens ever created for a 3-D film: a 150-foot-wide canvas. The film is beautifully scored and marks the first time that classic Disney characters appear in a computer-generated animation attraction. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Soarin\'</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Crowds:</b> Heavy.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Strategy:</b> Go early and grab a Fastpass, or go just before park closing.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Audience:</b> Adults and children 40\" or taller.

It\'s based on the popular attraction Soarin\' Over California at Disney\'s California Adventure in Anaheim. It uses motion-based technology to literally lift you in your seat 40 feet into the air within a giant projection-screen dome. As you soar above the Golden Gate Bridge, Napa Valley, Yosemite, and other California wonders, you feel the wind and smell pine forests and orange blossoms. Navy buffs get a kick out of swooping over a massive aircraft carrier. Duffers can\'t help but duck when that golf ball heads their way. The accompanying score created by Jerry Goldsmith (<i>Mulan, Star Trek</i>) builds on the thrill, and the crispness and definition of the film, projected at twice the rate of a typical motion picture, adds realism. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Space Mountain</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Duration:</b> 2½ min.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Crowds:</b> Large and steady, with long lines from morning to night despite high capacity.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Strategy:</b> Get a Fastpass ticket, or go at the beginning of the day, the end, or during a parade.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Audience:</b> All except young children.

Inside is what is arguably the world\'s most imaginative roller coaster. Although there are no loop-the-loops, gravitational whizbangs, or high-speed curves, the thrills are amply provided by Disney\'s masterful brainwashing as you take a trip into the depths of outer space—in the dark.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The wait to ride Space Mountain can be an hour or more if you don\'t have a Fastpass, so do your best to get one in the morning. As you walk to the loading area, you\'ll pass whirling planets and hear the screams and shrieks of the riders and the rattling of the cars, pumping you up for your own ride. Once you wedge yourself into the seat and blast off, the ride lasts only 2 minutes and 38 seconds, with a top speed of 28 mph, but the devious twists and invisible drops in the dark make it seem twice as long.

Plenty of old-fashioned twinkle lights are thrown in for good measure, and familiar tunes are broadcast over 204 speakers with 72,000 watts of power. Mickey, as always, is the star. But Practical Pig, from one of Disney\'s prewar Silly Symphony cartoons, steals the show. With the flick of a paintbrush, he transforms more than 100 feet of multicolor floats into a gleaming white-light dreamscape. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Splash Mountain</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Duration:</b> 11 min.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Crowds:</b> Yes!</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Strategy:</b> If you\'re not in line by 9:45 AM, plan to use Fastpass or ride during meal or parade times.

No pregnant women or guests wearing back, neck, or leg braces.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Rating:</b> ***</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The second most popular thrill ride in the park after Space Mountain, Splash Mountain is a log-flume water ride, based on the animated sequences in Disney\'s 1946 film <i>Song of the South.</i> Here the Audio-Animatronics creations of Brer Rabbit, Brer Bear, Brer Fox, and a menagerie of other Brer beasts frolic in bright, cartoonlike settings. When you settle into the eight-person hollowed-out logs, Uncle Remus\'s voice growls,\"Mark mah words, Brer Rabbit gonna put his foot in Brer Fox\'s mouth one of these days.\" And this just might be the day.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As the boat carries you up the mountain, Brer Rabbit\'s silhouette hops merrily ahead to the tune of the ride\'s theme song,\"Time to Be Moving Along.\" Every time some critter makes a grab for the bunny, your log boat drops out of reach. But Brer Fox has been studying his book <i>How to Catch a Rabbit,</i> and our lop-eared friend looks as if he\'s destined for the pot. Things don\'t look so good for the flumers, either. You get one heart-stopping pause at the top of the mountain—just long enough to grab the safety bar—and then the boat plummets down into a gigantic, very wet briar patch. In case you want to know what you\'re getting into, the drop is 52½ feet—that\'s about five stories—at a 45-degree angle, enough to reach speeds of 40 mph and make you feel weightless. Try to smile through your clenched teeth: as you begin to drop, a flashbulb pops. You can purchase a photographic memento of the experience before exiting the ride. Brer Rabbit escapes—and so do you, wet and exhilarated—to the tune of \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah,\" the bouncy, best-known melody from the film. If you want to get really wet—and you will get splashed from almost every seat—ask the attendant to seat you in the front row. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Bighorn sheep, mule deer, coyotes, grizzly bears, and black bears can often be seen from roadways.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Glacier in One Day</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\'s hard to beat the <b>Going-to-the-Sun Road</b> for a one-day trip in Glacier National Park. This itinerary takes you from west to east—if you\'re starting from St. Mary, take the tour backward. First, however, call Glacier Park Boat Tours 406/257-2426 to make a reservation for the <b>St. Mary Lake or Lake McDonald boat tour,</b> depending on where you end up. Then, drive up Going-to-the-Sun Road to <b>Avalanche Creek Campground</b> and take a 30-minute stroll along the fragrant <b>Trail of the Cedars.</b> Afterward, continue driving up—you can see views of waterfalls and wildlife to the left and an awe-inspiring, precipitous drop to the right. At the summit, <b>Logan Pass,</b> your arduous climb is rewarded with a gorgeous view of immense peaks, sometimes complemented by a herd of mountain goats. Stop in at the <b>visitor center,</b> then take the 1½-mi <b>Hidden Lake Trail</b> up to prime wildlife-viewing spots. Picnic at the overlook above Hidden Lake. In the afternoon, continue driving east over the mountains. Stop at the <b>Jackson Glacier Overlook</b> to view one of the park\'s largest glaciers. Continue down; eventually the forest thins, the vistas grow broader, and a gradual transition to the high plains begins. When you reach <b>Rising Sun Campground,</b> take the one-hour St. Mary Lake boat tour to St. Mary Falls. If you\'d rather hike, the 1-mi <b>Sun Point Nature Trail</b> also leads to the falls. (Take the boat tour if you\'re driving from east to west.) The Going-to-the-Sun Road is generally closed from early October to late May.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Getting There & Around</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On the east, U.S. 89 accesses Many Glacier and St. Mary; Route 49 reaches Two Medicine. On the west, U.S. 2 goes to West Glacier. The nearest airports are in Great Falls and Kalispell, Montana.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The roads are either paved or gravel and deteriorate from moisture freezing and thawing. Drive slowly and anticipate that rocks and wildlife may be around the corner. Road reconstruction is part of the park experience, as there are only a few warm months in which road crews can complete projects. Scenic pullouts are frequent; watch for other vehicles pulling in or out, and watch for children in parking areas. It\'s also courteous to pull over if you are traveling slowly and there are cars behind you. Most development and services center around St. Mary Lake on the east, and Lake McDonald on the west.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Glacier Park, Inc. operates a shuttle along the Going-to-the-Sun Road from July 1 to Labor Day. Buses make stops at major trailheads, campgrounds, and other developed areas between Lake McDonald Lodge and Rising Sun Motor Inn. For schedules and fares call 406/226-4041 or see www.glacierparkinc.com. Reservations are suggested.

Unlike Yellowstone\'s Grand Loop, Grand Teton\'s road system doesn\'t allow for easy tour-bus access to all the major sights. Only a car will get you close to Jenny Lake, into the remote east Jackson Hole hills, and to the top of Signal Mountain. You can stop at many points along the roads within the park for a hike or a view. Be extremely cautious in winter, when whiteouts and ice are not uncommon. There are adequate road signs throughout the park, but a good road map is handy to have in the vehicle.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Jackson Hole Highway (U.S. Highway 26/191/89) runs the entire length of the park, from Jackson to Yellowstone National Park\'s south entrance. (This highway is also called Route 26/191 south of Moran Junction and U.S. 287/26 north of Moran Junction.) This road is open all year from Jackson to Moran Junction and north to Flagg Ranch, 2 mi south of Yellowstone. Depending on traffic, the southern (Moose) entrance to Grand Teton is about 20 minutes from downtown Jackson via Highway 89/189 (Broadway Avenue), then right onto Wyoming 22 west and right at Wyoming 390 north (aka Moose-Wilson Road). Coming from the opposite direction on the same road, the northern boundary of the park is about 15 minutes south of Yellowstone National Park. Also open year-round, U.S. 26/287 runs east from Dubois over Togwotee Pass to the Moran entrance station, a drive of roughly an hour.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Grand Teton Lodge Company has shuttle service to its lodging properties, but if you drive, which is recommended, there is plenty of free parking at all developed areas and adequate parking at waysides and historic sites. Although break-ins aren\'t common, use good sense when leaving your vehicle for an extended period of time by locking valuables out of sight or taking them with you.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Two back-road entrances to Grand Teton require high-clearance or good-performing vehicles. Both are closed by snow from November through May and are heavily rutted through June. The Moose-Wilson Road (or Route 390) starts at its intersection with Route 22 in Wilson (4 mi west of Broadway Avenue in Jackson) and travels 7 mi north past Teton Village, then turns into an unpaved road for almost 1 mi until the Moose entrance. It\'s closed to large trucks, trailers, and RVs. Even rougher is 60-mi Grassy Lake Road, which heads east from Route 32 in Ashton, Idaho, through Targhee National Forest. It connects with U.S. 89/287 in the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway sandwiched between Grand Teton and Yellowstone.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bear Essentials</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The northern Rockies are bear country—grizzlies and black bears are a presence throughout the region. Seeing one across a valley, through a pair of binoculars, is fun, but meeting one at closer range isn\'t. There have been few fatal encounters, but almost every summer there are incidents involving bears.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Wherever you venture in Wyoming and Montana, keep in mind these tips for travel in bear country:</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Practical Precautions</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Avoid sudden encounters.</b> Whenever possible, travel in open country, during daylight hours, and in groups. Make noise—talking or singing is preferable to carrying \"bear bells\"—and leave your dog at home. Most attacks occur when a bear is surprised at close quarters or feels threatened.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Stay alert.</b> Look for signs of bears, such as fresh tracks, scat, matted vegetation, or partially consumed salmon.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Choose your tent site carefully.</b> Pitch the tent away from trails, streams with spawning salmon, and berry patches. Avoid areas that have a rotten smell or where scavengers have gathered; these may indicate the presence of a nearby bear cache, and bears aggressively defend their food supplies.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Keep food away from campsites.</b> Cook meals at least 100 feet from tents, and store food and other items that give off odors (including personal products such as soap, shampoo, lotions, and even toothpaste) away from campsites. Hang food between trees where possible, or store your food in bear-resistant food containers. Avoid strong-smelling foods, and clean up after cooking and eating. Store garbage in airtight containers or burn it and pack up the remains.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Encounter a Bear</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Identify yourself.</b> Talk to the bear, to identify yourself as a human. Don\'t yell. And don\'t run. Running will trigger a bear\'s predatory instincts, and a bear can easily outrun you. Back away slowly, and give the bear an escape route. Don\'t ever get between a mother and her cubs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Bigger is better.</b> Bears are less likely to attack a larger target. Therefore, increase your apparent size. Raise your arms above your head to appear larger and wave them slowly, to better identify yourself as a human. With two or more people, it helps to stand side by side. In a forested area it may be appropriate to climb a tree, but remember that black bears and young grizzlies are agile tree climbers.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>As a last resort, play dead.</b> If a bear charges and makes contact with you, fall to the ground, lie flat on your stomach or curl into a ball, hands behind your neck, and remain passive. If you are wearing a pack, leave it on. Once a bear no longer feels threatened, it will usually end its attack. Wait for the bear to leave before you move. The exception to this rule is when a bear displays predatory behavior. Instead of simply charging, a bear hunting for prey will show intense interest while approaching at a walk or run and it may circle, as if stalking you. But remember that such circumstances are exceedingly rare and most often involve black bears, which are much smaller and less aggressive than grizzlies (and can be driven off more easily).</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Grand Teton in One Day</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Begin the day by packing a picnic lunch or picking one up at a Jackson eatery. Arrive at <b>Moose Visitor Center</b> in time for a 9 AM, two-hour, guided Snake River float trip (make reservations in advance with one of the dozen or so outfitters that offer the trip). When you\'re back on dry ground, drive north on Teton Park Road, stopping at scenic turnouts—don\'t miss Teton Glacier—until you reach Jenny Lake Road, which is one-way headed south. After a brief stop at <b>Cathedral Group Turnout,</b> park at the Jenny Lake ranger station and take the 20-minute boat ride to <b>Cascade Canyon</b> trailhead for a short hike. Return to your car by midafternoon, drive back to Teton Park Road, and head north to Signal Mountain Road to catch a top-of-the-park view of the Tetons. In late afternoon descend the mountain and continue north on Teton Park Road. At Jackson Lake Junction, you can go east to <b>Oxbow Bend</b> or north to <b>Willow Flats,</b> both excellent spots for wildlife viewing before you head to <b>Jackson Lake Lodge</b> for dinner and an evening watching the sun set over the Tetons. Or if you\'d like to get back on the water, drive to <b>Colter Bay Marina,</b> where you can board a 1½-hour sunset cruise across Jackson Lake to Waterfalls Canyon. You can reverse this route if you\'re heading south from Yellowstone: start the day with a 7:30 AM breakfast cruise from Colter Bay and end it with a sunset float down the Snake River.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It demonstrates how people crossed the Snake River before bridges were built. In the cluster of turn-of-the-20th-century buildings there are historical displays, including a photo collection of historic shots taken in the area; one building has been turned into a small general store. You can pick up a pamphlet for a self-guided tour. Check out the nearby general supplies store where candy and pop are sold in the summer.

More than 4,800 archaeological sites and 3 million objects of the Ancestral Puebloans have been unearthed at Mesa Verde.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Geological Goodies: Get low and look close; the desert landscape has a story to tell. Ripple marks suggest the area was once covered with water, turtleback weathering notes the effects of erosion, and flower-pattern solution rills reveal the power of acidic rain on the sandstone\'s structure.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Bright Nights: Gaze into the sky\'s starry depths. With no major cities nearby to reflect light at night, the Four Corners area is an ideal place to be an amateur astronomer.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Getting There & Around</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The park is located off U.S. 160, between Cortez and Durango in what\'s known as the Four Corners. The nearest bus station and regional airport are 35 mi away in Durango, Colorado, a small city worth exploring.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most of the scenic drives at Mesa Verde involve steep grades and hairpin turns, particularly on Wetherill Mesa. Vehicles over 8,000 pounds or 25 feet are prohibited on this road. Towed vehicles are prohibited past Morefield Campground. Check the condition of your vehicle\'s brakes before driving the road to Wetherill Mesa. For the latest road information, tune your radio to Traveler\'s Information Station at 1610 AM, or call the ranger station at 970/529-4461. Off-road vehicles are prohibited in the park.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Flora & Fauna</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Since 2000, wildfires have claimed thousands of Mesa Verde\'s acres. Visitors will see the scars for a long time, as it can take 300 years for an evergreen woodland to restore itself. In spring and summer, however, you\'ll still see brightly colored blossoms, like the yellow Perky Sue, sage, yucca, and mountain mahogany. Sand-loving blue lupines are seen along the roadways in the higher elevations, and bright-red Indian paintbrushes are scattered throughout the rocky cliffs.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mule deer are the park\'s most frequently sighted larger animals. About 200 species of birds, including red-tailed hawks and golden eagles, live in Mesa Verde, as does the poisonous prairie rattler (give it plenty of space and it\'ll likely just mosey along on its way). The animals seek shade in trees and under brush, so the best times to spot them are in the early morning and just before dusk.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Start your whirlwind tour with a day in <b>Arches National Park.</b> You can drive the park\'s main road and see a few of the top sights in day; be sure to save time for at least one short hike, but at least stop at the Delicate Arch trailhead to see Wolfe Ranch and then drive to the viewpoint trail for a glimpse of the state icon. On Day 2, pack a picnic lunch and head for <b>Canyonlands National Park</b> \'s Island in the Sky District. On the way, stop at <b>Dead Horse Point State Park.</b> Make sure you have plenty of film for this day\'s tour. Make time for a morning hike and drive all the way to the tip of the \"island\" to Grandview Point. Spend Day 3 on the Colorado River with one of Moab\'s many river-rafting companies. Select either a playful daily raft trip or a scenic tour via a sturdy jet boat.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 5 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend your first and second days as above in the three-day tour, basing yourself in <b>Moab.</b> On the third day choose between a river expedition or traveling south to the Needles District of <b>Canyonlands National Park.</b> Upon leaving Canyonlands continue your journey south on U.S. 191 to <b>Blanding,</b> where you should make a stop at <b>Edge of the Cedars State Park</b> to learn about the ancient Native Americans who inhabited this country. Continue south to Route 95, and stop at <b>Natural Bridges National Monument.</b> If you can, make arrangements to spend the night at Fry Canyon Lodge in the heart of Cedar Mesa. On Day 4, continue on Route 95 and cross <b>Lake Powell</b> at Hite before continuing north. Camp that night at Goblin Valley State Park near <b>Hanksville,</b> or continue on to <b>Green River</b> for less rustic accommodation.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Hoodoos, Bridges & Arches</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After a while, the fantastically eroded landscapes and formations found in southern Utah can all begin to look the same. Don\'t worry. It happens to everyone. A brief course in the geology of the Colorado Plateau can get your vacation back on track and clear up any confusion while you\'re busy making memories.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">An <b>arch</b> is an opening created primarily by the ceaseless erosional powers of wind and weather. Airborne sand constantly scours cliff faces; tiny and huge chunks of stone are pried away by minuscule pockets of water as it freezes, expands, and thaws, again and again over the course of thousands or millions of years. Arches are found in all stages, from cavelike openings that don\'t go all the way through a stone fin to gigantic stone ribbons shaped by an erosional persistence that defies imagination.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Bridges</b> are the product of stream or river erosion. They span what at some time was a water source powerful enough to wear away softer layers of sedimentary stone through constant force and motion. As softer stone is washed away, the harder capstone layers remain in the form of natural bridges.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most bizarrely shaped formations have the strangest name. <b>Hoodoos</b> are chunks of rock chiseled through time into columns or pinnacles. Like all rock formations, hoodoos are constructed of layers and layers of horizontal bands. Each band or stratum has its own composition. When wind or water, particularly in the form of heavy, sporadic rainstorms, goes to work on these pillars, the eventual result is a hoodoo—an eccentric and grotesque formation usually found in the company of other hoodoos.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Where the West Was Filmed</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Were it not for Hollywood—with a little help from Harry Goulding—Monument Valley might have remained a quiet, hidden enclave of the Navajo Nation. Goulding urged John Ford to help bring the beauty of Monument Valley to the attention of the American public. Ford began in 1938 with his classic movie <i>Stagecoach,</i> and the film notoriety never ended. Ford subsequently filmed <i>My Darling Clementine, War Party,</i> and <i>She Wore a Yellow Ribbon</i> during the 1940s. Then came <i>Billy the Kid, Kit Carson, Fort Apache, How the West Was Won, The Living Desert, The Searchers,</i> and <i>Cheyenne Autumn.</i> And those were just the John Ford Westerns.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The area is as popular a film location today as it was in the 1940s and \'50s, when Americans (and Hollywood) were just learning about it. Monument Valley is frequently seen as a backdrop for automobile and other commercials. Dozens more films have been shot in the area, including a few classics (and nonclassics): <i>2001: A Space Odyssey, Easy Rider, The Moviemakers, National Lampoon\'s Vacation, Back to the Future Part III, Forrest Gump, Pontiac Moon, Waiting to Exhale,</i> and <i>Windtalkers.</i></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">While many people associate Monument Valley with filmmaking or as a home to the Navajo Nation, others cannot think about the area without remembering Harry Goulding and his wife Mike, who established the trading post there in 1923. The Gouldings offered crucial trading services to the Navajos for more than half a century. Today, Goulding\'s Trading Post is on the National Register of Historic Places and still provides lodging, meals, and other services to tourists who visit the area.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Pick a base—whether it\'s <b>Westhampton Beach</b>, <b>Southampton</b>, <b>East Hampton</b>, or <b>Montauk</b> —from which to visit nearby villages. You can loll about on a beach, take a fishing trip, eat at top restaurants, shop at stylish boutiques, and see a few sights.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Alternatively, break up a stay on laid-back <b>Shelter Island</b> with a visit to <b>Greenport</b>. Stop at a couple of North Fork wineries and antiques stores on your way to or from Shelter Island.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 5 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You can easily combine tastes of the North and South forks by staying in <b>Westhampton Beach</b>, <b>Sag Harbor</b>, <b>Greenport</b>, or <b>Shelter Island</b>. Let the weather dictate your schedule. Rainy and cold days are good for checking out the wineries, museums, and shops. On the hottest days, head for the beach either in the morning or in the late afternoon.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Pleasures & Pastimes</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beaches</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Clean white-sand beaches are Long Island\'s main attraction for most visitors, whether their idea of beach fun is lounging on the warm sand, watching the sun drop slowly into the water, swimming or surfing in the rolling waves, or just strolling along the shore and breathing the fresh salt air. For serious waves, head to the magnificent South Shore, which includes Jones Beach, Robert Moses, and Fire Island. The seashore tends to get crowded on summer weekends, but as you move out east, the crowds thin—especially all the way out in Montauk. Most Hamptons beaches are open only to residents, but lodging properties usually have beach passes for their guests.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fishing</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lined on one side by the Long Island Sound and on the other by the Atlantic Ocean, and nicked by numerous bays and harbors, Long Island provides countless chances for anglers to indulge their passion and fisherfolk to make their living. The waters here draw commercial-fishing vessels and sporting boats, pros and weekend warriors. In virtually every village that snuggles up against the water, you find docks, marinas, bait-and-tackle shops, and people willing to discuss the tides, weather, and best places to fish. Depending on the season and area, you can try your rod at striped bass, fluke, bluefish, flounder, skate, and even tuna and shark offshore. There\'s good surf casting at Montauk Point and Jones Beach. Charter boats glide in and out of harbors at Greenport, Shelter Island, and Montauk, filled with people seeking a prize for their wall or freezer.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wineries</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The white-sand beaches of the North Fork encircle a broad, central agricultural belt that, it turns out, has near-perfect conditions for ripening European grape varieties like merlot and chardonnay. Now that the quality of Long Island wines rivals that of the world\'s top labels, the North Fork draws serious wine lovers and sightseeing fun seekers alike. Navigating the North Fork wine trail is really about deciding how often to stop, as all but three of the region\'s 30 wineries are on Route 25, which runs east-west through the fork, or on Route 48, running north of and parallel to Route 25. Each winery has its own personality; some encourage a quiet focus on the wine, whereas at others you jostle for a place at the lively bar. Some are in old barns that retain rural charm in wide-planked wood floors, heavy beams, and old farming equipment. Summer weekends—particularly when bad weather foils beach plans—attract droves of winery-hoppers. Fall brings harvest festivals and day-trippers buying fresh vegetables at farm stands and mixed cases of wines for the holidays. Off-season, the wineries are very quiet, and you\'re likely to be showered with extra attention.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The North Fork Wine Trail</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When Louisa and Alex Hargrave planted their first grape vines at their eponymous vineyard in 1973, they also planted the seeds of a new North Fork industry. Little more than a quarter-century later, the area\'s burgeoning wine industry is attracting ever-more attention. (The Hargraves sold the winery in 1999 and the place was renamed Castello di Borghese Vineyard.)</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chardonnay and merlot together account for more than 60% of the varietals grown on Long Island; cabernet franc, cabernet sauvignon, sauvignon blanc, chenin blanc, malbec, pinot blanc, pinot gris, pinot noir, Riesling, and viognier are among the others planted here. Land devoted to vineyards on the East End exceeds 3,000 acres.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From Aquebogue to Greenport, 20-plus wineries and vineyards—the majority on or close to routes 25 or 48—are open to the public for tastings and, at some, tours; most host special events as well.

Nantucket\'s totemic clothing items are made of cotton dyed red so as to fade to a dull salmon shade. The reds were something of a secret code until they were singled out by <i>The Official Preppy Handbook</i> in 1980: \"By their pink shirts ye shall know them\" might be the watchwords for Nantucketers among the worldwide sailing community. Now reds are as site-specific as Martha\'s Vineyard\'s Black Dog line (attempting to compete, of late, with a satellite shop on Straight Wharf).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The principal purveyor of Nantucket reds is Murray\'s Toggery Shop on Main Street, which has catered to conservative dressers since the early 1900s. (Roland Macy worked here at his father\'s shop in the early 1800s before setting off to rewrite retailing history.) From baby togs to tote bags, you\'ll find everything you could want here in the way of reds. But for that weathered look that sets them off so well, you\'ll have to get out on the water.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Navigating the Rental Market</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you\'re going to be staying for a week or more, you might want to consider renting a cottage or house—an arrangement that gives you a chance to settle in and get a real taste of island living. Many visitors, especially those with children, find renting more relaxing than staying in a hotel or an inn. With your own kitchen, you\'ll save money by eating in; plus you can enjoy such homey summer pleasures as barbecues. Though decor can vary from chichi to weatherworn, most cottages come equipped with all you\'ll need to ensure a comfortable stay. Steer clear of a house without linens; it\'s a sign of bad things to come. The better houses come fully accoutered: not just with basics but with luxury touches like cable or satellite TV, a CD player, gourmet kitchen implements, beach chairs, and bikes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Finding a great cottage or house can be tough, however, especially since so many are rented a year or more in advance by returning guests. The time to start your search is a summer ahead, though you can occasionally find a property as late as spring. A good way to shop is to stop in and visit Realtors when you happen to be in town. Be prepared for a bit of sticker shock, though. Prices are generally about twice what you\'d have to pay on Cape Cod or even the Vineyard. In summer, very rustic (read shabby) rentals start at about $1,200 a week and can run to many times that ($3,500 and up) for multibedroom or waterfront properties.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Information</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Country Village Rentals</b> (10 Straight Wharf. tel. 508/228-8840 or 800/599-7368. www.cvrandr.com) knows its clientele, who like to flit to sweet spots like Stowe and St. Bart\'s. <b>Lucille Jordan Real Estate</b> (8 Federal St.tel. 508/228-4449. www.jordanre.com) has a broad rental inventory; check the photos lining the storefront windows.

The museum received a $14 million expansion and refurbishment in 2005. Items on view in the handsome galleries include harpoons and other whale-hunting implements; portraits of whaling captains and their wives (a few of whom went whaling as well); the South Seas curiosities they brought home; a large collection of sailors\' crafts, a full-size tryworks once used to process whale oil aboard ship; and the original 16-foot-high 1850 lens from Sankaty Head Lighthouse.

The temptation is to cram everything the state has to offer into a two-week trip, and it just can\'t be done. If you succumb to this type of schedule, you\'ll find yourself frantically rushing from attraction to attraction and wind up seeing a blur of visions as they pass by your windshield.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Don\'t see it all through glass. Take some hikes, catch some fish, watch some birds, see some whales. If you\'re prepared to rough it a bit, all the better. Bring, borrow, or rent some camping gear and look into the public-use cabins scattered across the state. Or, just do an overnight in a tent—the opportunities for getting an hour or two away from a trailhead and bedding down for the night with no remnants of civilization other than what you carry on your back are too numerous to enumerate. You\'ll acquire a new understanding of Alaska\'s allure, and have experienced a part of the state that too few visitors ever enjoy.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

You\'ll find three distinct ecosystems here—verdant mountain valleys towering with proud ponderosa pines and Douglas firs; higher and colder subalpine mountains with wind-whipped trees (krummholz) that grow at right angles; and harsh, unforgiving alpine tundra with dollhouse-size versions of familiar plants and wildflowers. The high, wind-whipped ecosystem of alpine tundra is seldom found outside the Arctic, yet it makes up one-third of the park\'s terrain. Few plants can survive at the tundra\'s elevation, but many beautiful wildflowers—including alpine forget-me-nots—bloom briefly in late June or early July.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The park has so much wildlife that you can often enjoy prime viewing from the seat of your car. Fall, when many animals begin moving down from higher elevations, is an excellent time to spot the park\'s animal residents. This is also when you\'ll hear the male elk bugle mating calls (popular \"listening\" spots are Horseshoe Park, Moraine Park, and Upper Beaver Meadows).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">May through mid-October is the best time to see the bighorn sheep that congregate in the Horseshoe Park-Sheep Lakes area, just past the Fall River entrance. If you want to glimpse a moose, try Kawuneeche Valley, on the park\'s western side. Other animals in the park include mule deer, squirrels, chipmunks, pikas, beavers, and marmot. Common birds are broad-tailed and rufous hummingbirds, peregrine falcons, woodpeckers, mountain bluebirds, and Clark\'s nutcracker, as well as the white-tailed ptarmigan, spotted year-round on the alpine tundra.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mountain lions, black bears, and bobcats also inhabit the park but are rarely spotted by visitors.

The 48-mi road connects the park\'s gateways of Estes Park and Grand Lake. The views around each bend—of moraines and glaciers, and craggy hills framing emerald meadows carpeted with columbine and Indian paintbrush—are truly awesome. As it passes through three ecosystems—montane, subalpine, and arctic tundra—the road climbs 4,300 feet in elevation. As you drive the road, take your time at the numerous turnouts to gaze over verdant valleys, brushed with yellowing aspen in fall, that slope between the glacier-etched granite peaks. <b>Many Parks Curve</b> affords views of the crest of the Continental Divide and of the <b>Alluvial Fan,</b> a huge gash a vicious flood created after an earthen dam broke in 1982. Pick up a copy of the <i>Trail Ridge Road Guide,</i> available at visitor centers, for an overview of what you will be seeing as you drive the road. In normal traffic, it\'s a two-hour drive across the park, but it\'s best to give yourself three to four hours to allow for leisurely breaks at the overlooks. Note that the middle part of the road closes down again by mid-October, though you can still drive up about 10 mi from the west and 8 mi from the east.

Juniper trees, cottonwoods, and willows grow along Puerco River Wash, providing shelter for all manner of wildlife. You might spot mule deer, coyotes, prairie dogs, and foxes, while other inhabitants, like porcupines and bobcats, tend to hide. Bird-watchers should keep an eye out for mockingbirds, red-tailed and Swainson\'s hawks, roadrunners, swallows, and hummingbirds. Look for all three kinds of lizards—collared, side-blotched, and southern prairie—in rocks.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Beware of rattlesnakes. They are common but can generally be avoided if you use sense: Watch where you step, and don\'t step anywhere you can\'t see. If you do come across a rattler, give it plenty of space, and let it go its way before you continue yours. Other reptiles—and there are plenty—are just as common but not as worrisome. The gopher snake looks similar to a rattlesnake, but is nonpoisonous. The collared lizard, with its yellow head, can be seen scurrying out of your way just about everywhere in bursts measured at up to 15 mph. They are not poisonous, but will bite in the rare instance of being caught.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Petroglyphs: The Writing on the Wall</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The rock art of early Native Americans is carved or painted on basalt boulders, on canyon walls, and on the underside of overhangs throughout eastern Arizona. Designs pecked or scratched into the stone are called petroglyphs; those that are painted on the surface are pictographs. Few pictographs remain because of the deleterious effects of weathering, but the more durable petroglyphs number in the thousands. No one knows the exact meaning of these signs, and interpretations vary; they have been related to shamanistic and hunting rituals and identified as clan signs, maps, or even indications of visits by extraterrestrials.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\'s just as difficult to date a \"glyph\" as it is to understand it. Archaeologists try to determine a general time frame by judging the style, the date of other sites and pottery in the vicinity, the amount of patination (formation of minerals) on the design, or the superimposition of newer images on top of older ones. Most of eastern Arizona\'s rock art is estimated to be at least 1,000 years old, and many of the glyphs were created even earlier.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Some glyphs depict animals like bighorn sheep, deer, bear, and mountain lions; others are geometric patterns. The most unusual are the anthropomorphs, strange humanlike figures with elaborate headdresses. A concentric circle is a common design. A few of these circles served as solstice signs, indicating summer and winter solstice and other important dates. At a certain time in the year, when the angle of the sun is just right, a shaft of light shines through a crack in a nearby rock, illuminating the center of the circle. Archaeologists believe these solar calendars helped determine the time for ceremonies and planting. Many solstice signs are in remote regions, but you can visit the Petrified Forest National Park around June 20 to see a concentric circle illuminated during the summer solstice. The glyph, reached by paved trail just a few hundred yards from the parking area, is visible year-round, but a finger of light shines directly in the center during the week of the solstice. The phenomenon occurs at 9 AM, a reasonable hour for looking at the calendar.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Damaged by vandalism, many rock-art sites are not open to the public, but <b>Hieroglyphic Point in Salt River Canyon</b>, <b>Five-Mile Canyon in Snowflake</b>, <b>Lyman Lake State Park</b>, and <b>Petrified Forest National Park</b> are all good spots to view petroglyphs.

In 1984 the fossil remains of one of the oldest dinosaurs ever unearthed—dating from the Triassic period of the Mesozoic era 225 million years ago—were discovered here; other plant and animal fossils in the park date from the same period. Remnants of ancient human beings and their artifacts, dating back 10,000 years, have been recovered at more than 500 sites in this national park.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The park derives its name from the grounds that are covered with petrified tree trunks whose wood cells were replaced over centuries by brightly hued mineral deposits—silica, iron oxide, manganese, aluminum, copper, lithium, and carbon. In many places, petrified logs scattered about the landscape resemble a fairy-tale forest turned to stone. The park\'s 93,000 acres doubled to nearly 186,000 acres with new land acquisition in 2005, but most of this new area will remain as backcountry. Included in the park are portions of the vast, pink-hue lunarlike landscape known as the <b>Painted Desert.</b> In the northern area of the park, this colorful but essentially barren series of windswept plains, hills, and mesas is considered by geologists to be part of the Chinle formation, deposited at an early stage of the Triassic period. At midday the park may seem bland; to appreciate the colors visit before 10 AM and after 2 PM.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Visitors can begin the 28-mi drive through the park either from the northern Interstate 40 entrance or the southern entrance off U.S. 180. Those continuing on to New Mexico should enter from the park\'s south entrance, ending up with Interstate 40\'s straight shot over the border toward Albuquerque. Visitors with accommodations in Holbrook should tour the park from south end to north end, saving dramatic sunset vistas of the Painted Desert for last. As you leave the park, rangers will question you to be certain you haven\'t been tempted to collect a souvenir of petrified wood. www.nps.gov/pefo. COST: $10 per vehicle or $5 per person on foot, bicycle, motorcycle, or bus, valid for seven days. OPEN: Daily 8-5 except for Christmas Day. Extended summer hours; call for information. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Salt River Canyon</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Exposing a time lapse of 500 million years, the multicolor spires, buttes, mesas, and walls of the Salt River Canyon have inspired its nickname, the mini-Grand Canyon. Approaching the Salt River Canyon from Phoenix, U.S. 60 climbs through rolling hills, and the terrain changes from high desert with cactus and mesquite trees to forests of ponderosa pine. After entering the San Carlos Indian Reservation, the highway drops 2,000 feet and makes a series of hairpin turns to the Salt River. Stop at the viewing and interpretive display area before crossing the bridge to stretch your legs. Wander along the banks below and enjoy the rock-strewn rapids. On hot days slip your shoes off and dip your feet into the chilly water. The river and canyon are open to hiking, camping, fishing, and white-water rafting, but you need a permit as this is tribal land. For information and recreational permits, contact the <b>San Carlos Apache Tribe</b> (tel. 928/475-2343 or 888/475-2344. www.sancarlosapache.com) or the <b>White Mountain Apache Tribe</b> (tel. 928/338-4385. www.wmat.nsn.us). </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Coronado Trail</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Surely one of the world\'s curviest roads, this steep, winding portion of U.S. 191 was referred to as the Devil\'s Highway in its prior incarnation as U.S. 666. More significantly, the route parallels the one allegedly followed more than 450 years ago by Spanish explorer Francisco Vásquez de Coronado on his search for the legendary Seven Cities of Cibola, where the streets were reputedly paved with gold and jewels.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This 127-mi stretch of highway is renowned for the transitions of its spectacular scenery over a dramatic 5,000-foot elevation change—from rolling meadows to spruce- and ponderosa pine-covered mountains, down into the Sonoran Desert\'s piñon pine, grassland savannas, juniper stands, and cacti. A trip down the Coronado Trail crosses through Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, as well as the White Mountain Apache and San Carlos Apache Indian reservations.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Allow a good four hours to make the drive, more if you plan to stop and leisurely explore—which you should.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Pause at <b>Blue Vista,</b> perched on the edge of the Mogollon Rim, about 30 mi outside Alpine, to take in views of the Blue Range Mountains to the east and the succession of tiered valleys dropping some 4,000 feet back down into the Sonoran Desert. Still above the rim, this is one of your last opportunities to enjoy the blue spruce, ponderosa pine, and high-country mountain meadows.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">About 17 mi south of Blue Vista, the Coronado Trail continues to twist and turn, eventually crossing under 8,786-foot <b>Rose Peak.</b> Named for the wild roses growing on its mountainside, Rose Peak is also home to a fire lookout tower from which peaks more than 100 mi away can be seen on a clear day. This is a great picnic-lunch stop.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After Rose Peak, enjoy the remaining scenery some 70 more mi until you reach the less scenic towns of Clifton and Morenci, homes to a massive copper mine. U.S. 191 then swings back west, links up with U.S. 70, and provides a fairly straight shot to Globe. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

His surrender to General Nelson Miles on September 5, 1886, marked the end of the Indian Wars in the West. Geronimo\'s fleetness in evading the massed troops of the U.S. Army and his legendary immunity to bullets made him the darling of sensationalistic journalists, and he became the most famous outlaw in America.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">When the combined forces of the U.S. Army and Mexican troops failed to rout the powerful shaman from his territory straddling Arizona and Mexico, General Miles sent his officer Lieutenant Gatewood and relatives of Geronimo\'s renegade band of warriors to persuade Geronimo to parley with Miles near the mouth of Skeleton Canyon, at the edge of the Peloncillo Mountains. After several days of talks, Geronimo and his warriors agreed to the presented treaty and surrendered their arms.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Geronimo related the scene years later: \"We stood between his troopers and my warriors. We placed a large stone on the blanket before us. Our treaty was made by this stone, as it was to last until the stone should crumble to dust; so we made the treaty, and bound each other with an oath.\" However, the political promises quickly unraveled, and the most feared of Apache medicine men spent the next 23 years in exile as a prisoner of war. He died on February 17, 1909, never having returned to his beloved homeland, and was buried in the Apache cemetery in Fort Sill, Oklahoma.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">In 1934 a stone monument was built on State Route 80 in Apache, Arizona, as a reminder of Geronimo\'s surrender in 1886. The 16-foot-tall monument lies 10 mi northwest of the actual surrender site in Skeleton Canyon, where an unobtrusive sign and a pile of rocks mark the place where the last stone was cast.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Snap \"Shot\" of Tequila</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Agave, the plant from which fine tequila is made, flourishes in southern Arizona. Many people think the agave is a cactus, but it\'s actually a succulent, closely related to the lily and amaryllis. Only blue agave—just one of 136 species—is used to make true tequila, but other species are used to make mezcal, the more generic type of liquor. Tequila is a specific type of mezcal, just as bourbon and scotch are specific types of whiskey. Many of the cheap brands are actually <i>mixtos,</i> which means they aren\'t 100% agave; true tequila isn\'t cheap, and you can pay more than $50 per bottle for a premium brand.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Across the border in Mexico there are more than 50 tequila producers, so it\'s understandable that tequila is a popular drink in Arizona. In fact, more tequila is consumed in the United States than anywhere else, including Mexico. The heart of the tequila-making region is Tequila itself, 30 mi west of Guadalajara, in the state of Jalisco. The hills around the town are responsible for its name, \"tel\" meaning \"hill,\" and \"quilla,\" a kind of lava around the dead volcanoes in the area.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To produce tequila, the bulb of the blue agave plant is harvested (it may weigh up to 150 pounds), heated to break down the sugars, and fermented. The best brands, Herradura and El Tesoro, are fermented with wild yeasts that add distinctive flavors to the final product. The fermented tequila is then placed into pot stills, where it is double-distilled to 90 proof or higher. Bottles designated \"añejo\" have been aged for a minimum of a year in oak barrels—these tequilas are the most expensive.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The Chiricahua Apache—who lived in the mountains for centuries and, led by Cochise and Geronimo, tried for 25 years to prevent white pioneers from settling here—dubbed it the Land of the Standing-Up Rocks. Enormous outcroppings of volcanic rock have been worn by erosion and fractured by uplift into strange pinnacles and spires. Because of the particular balance of sunshine and rain in the area, in April and May visitors will see brown, yellow, and red leaves coexisting with new green foliage. Summer in Chiricahua National Monument is exceptionally wet: from July through September there are thunderstorms nearly every afternoon. Few other areas in the United States have such varied plant, bird, and animal life. Deer, coatimundi, peccaries, and lizards live among the aspen, ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, oak, and cypress trees—to name just a few.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Chiricahua National Monument is an excellent area for bird-watchers, and hikers have more than 17 mi of scenic trails. The admission fee is good for seven days. Hiking trail maps are available at the visitor center. The most popular and rewarding hike is the moderately easy <b>Echo Canyon Loop Trail</b>. This 3.3-mi path winds through cave-like grottos, brilliant rock formations, and a wooded canyon. Birds and other wildlife are abundant here. www.nps.gov/chir. COST: $5. OPEN: Visitor center daily 8-4:30. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Kartchner Caverns</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The publicity that surrounded the official opening of Kartchner Caverns in November 1999 was in marked contrast to the secrecy that shrouded their discovery 25 years earlier and concealed their existence for 14 years. The two young spelunkers, Gary Tenen and Randy Tufts, who stumbled into what is now considered one of the most spectacular cave systems anywhere, played a fundamental role in its protection and eventual development. Great precautions have been taken to protect the wet-cave system—which comprises 13,000 feet of passages and two chambers as long as football fields—from damage by light and dryness.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The Discovery Center introduces visitors to the cave and its formations, and hour-long guided tours take small groups into the upper cave. Spectacular formations include the longest soda straw stalactite in the United States at 21 feet and 2 inches. The Big Room is viewed on a separate tour: it holds the world\'s most extensive formation of brushite moonmilk, the first reported occurrence of turnip shields, and the first noted occurrence of birdsnest needle formations. Other funky and fabulous formations include brilliant red flowstone, rippling multihued stalactites, delicate white helictites, translucent orange bacon, and expansive mud flats. It\'s also the nursery roost for female cave myotis bats from April through September, during which time the lower cave is closed in an effort to foster the cave\'s unique ecosystem. Kartchner Caverns is a wet, \"live\" cave, meaning that water still rises up from the surface to increase the multicolor calcium carbonate formations already visible.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The total cavern size is 2.4 mi long, but the explored areas cover only 1,600 feet by 1,100 feet. The average relative humidity inside is 99%, so visitors are often graced with \"cave kisses,\" water droplets from above. Because the climate outside the caves is so dry, it is estimated that if air got inside, it could deplete the moisture in only a few days, halting the growth of the speleothems that decorate its walls. To prevent this, there are 22 environmental monitoring stations that measure air and soil temperature, relative humidity, evaporation rates, air trace gases, and airflow inside the caverns. Tour reservations are required, and should be made several months in advance. If you\'re here and didn\'t make a reservation, you may be in luck: the park reserves 100 walk-up tickets each day, available on a first-come, first-served basis, for the Rotunda/Throne Room tour (arrive early for a shot at these). Hiking trails, picnic areas, and campsites are available on the park\'s 550 acres. www.pr.state.az.us.

The word \"vortex\" comes from the Latin <i>vertere,</i> which means \"to turn or whirl.\" In Sedona, a vortex is a funnel created by the motion of spiraling energy. Sedona has long been believed to be a center for spiritual power because of the vortexes of subtle energy in the area. This energy isn\'t described as electricity or magnetism, though it\'s said to leave a slight residual magnetism in the places where it\'s strongest.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">New Agers believe there are four major vortexes in Sedona: Airport, Cathedral Rock, Boynton Canyon, and Bell Rock. Each manifests a different kind of energy, and this energy interacts with the individual in its presence. People come from all over the world to experience these energy forms, hoping for guidance in spiritual matters, health, and relationships.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Juniper trees, which are all over the Sedona area, are said to respond to vortex energy in a way that reveals where this energy is strongest. The stronger the energy, the more axial twist the junipers bear in their branches.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Airport Vortex</b> is said to strengthen one\'s \"masculine\" side, aiding in self-confidence and focus. <b>Cathedral Rock Vortex</b> nurtures one\'s \"feminine\" aspects, such as patience and kindness. You\'ll be directed to <b>Boynton Canyon Vortex</b> if you\'re seeking balance between the masculine and feminine. And finally <b>Bell Rock Vortex</b>, the most powerful of all, strengthens all three aspects: masculine, feminine, and balance.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">These energy centers are easily accessed, and vortex maps are available at crystal shops all over Sedona.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Red Rock Geology</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">It\'s hard to imagine that the landlocked desert surrounding Sedona was, for much of prehistoric time, an area of dunes and swamps on the shore of an ancient sea. The ebb and flow of this sea shaped the land. When the sea rose, it planed the dunes before dropping more sediment on top. The process continued for a few hundred million years. Eventually the sediment hardened into gray layers of limestone on top of the red sandstone. When North America collided with another continental plate, the land buckled and lifted, forming the Rocky Mountains and raising northern Arizona thousands of feet. Volcanoes erupted in the area, capping some of the rock with erosion-resistant basalt.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Oak Creek started flowing at this time, eroding through the layers of sandstone and limestone. Along with other forces of erosion, the creek carved out the canyons and shaped the buttes. Sedona\'s buttes stayed intact because a resilient layer of lava had hardened on top and slowed the erosion process considerably. As iron minerals in the sandstone were gradually exposed to the elements, they turned red in a process similar to rusting. The iron minerals, in turn, stained the surrounding colorless quartz and grains of sand—it only takes 2% red-iron material to give the sandstone its red color.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Like the rings of a tree, the striations in the rock document the passage of time and the events, limestone marking the rise of the sea, sandstone when the region was coastline.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The road winds through a steep-walled canyon, where you crane your neck for views of the dramatic rock formations above. Although the forest is primarily evergreen, the fall foliage is glorious. Oak Creek, which runs along the bottom, is lined with tent campgrounds, fishing camps, cabins, motels, and restaurants. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Chapel of the Holy Cross</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You needn\'t be religious to be inspired by the setting and the architecture here. Built in 1956 by Marguerite Brunwige Staude, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, this modern landmark, with a huge cross on the facade, rises between two red-rock peaks. Vistas of the town and the surrounding area are spectacular. There are no regular services, but anyone is welcome for quiet meditation. A small gift shop sells religious artifacts and books.

The nearest commercial airport is 46 mi away in St. George, Utah. Off Route 9, the park is 21 mi east of Interstate 15 and 24 mi west of U.S. 89.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">November through March, private vehicles are allowed on Zion\'s main park road, Zion Canyon Scenic Drive. From April through October, however, it is closed to private vehicles. During this time, the park\'s easy-to-use shuttle system ferries people into the canyon from the Zion Canyon Visitor Center, where the parking lot is typically full, 10 to 3 daily, May through September. To avoid parking hassles, leave your car in the nearby town of Springdale and ride the town shuttle to the park entrance where you can connect with the park shuttle. Town shuttle stops are at Majestic View, Driftwood Motel, Quality Inn, Bit &amp; Spur Restaurant, Zion Park Inn, Bumbleberry Inn, Pizza and Noodle Company, Zion Canyon Clothing, Flanigan\'s Inn, and Zion Giant Screen Theater. The shuttles are free, but you must pay the park entrance fee.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you enter or exit Zion via the east entrance you will have the privilege of driving a gorgeous, twisting 24-mi stretch of the Zion-Mount Carmel Highway (Route 9). Two tunnels, including the highway\'s famous 1 1/10-mi tunnel, lie between the east park entrance and Zion Canyon. The tunnels are so narrow that vehicles more than 7 feet, 10 inches wide or 11 feet, 4 inches high require traffic control while passing through. Rangers, who are stationed at the tunnels 8 AM to 8 PM daily, April through October, stop oncoming traffic so you can drive down the middle of the tunnels. Large vehicles must pay an escort fee of $15 at either park entrance. West of the tunnels the highway meets Zion Canyon Scenic Drive at Canyon Junction, about 1 mi north of the Zion Canyon Visitor Center.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Flora & Fauna</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Zion Canyon\'s unique geography—the park is on the Colorado Plateau and bordered by the Great Basin and Mojave Desert provinces—supports more than 900 species of plants in environments that range from desert to hanging garden to high plateau. (Those so inclined have a variety of field guides unique to the region from which to choose in the bookstore at the Zion Canyon Visitor Center.) And yes, poison ivy is among the plant species, so ask a ranger where it is most common and keep an eye out for the itchy plant.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">You are more likely to see wildlife in off-seasons because there\'s less human and vehicular traffic. But the introduction of the park shuttle has allowed some animals to return to the park\'s interior, so even in high season you can spot mule deer wandering in shady glens as you ride through the park, especially in early morning and near dusk.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The best opportunity for viewing wildlife is on the hiking trails. You\'ll see a large variety of lizards and you may be surprised by a Gambel\'s quail. Mountain lions and ringtail cats (which are not cats but are similar to raccoons) prowl the park, but you\'re more likely to spot their tracks than the elusive animals themselves. Black bear are rare, and when they do stumble into park boundaries, it is in the remote high country. All animals, from the smallest chipmunk to the biggest elk, should be given plenty of space.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Good Reads</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Towers of Stone</b> by J.L.

The reality, however, is that there is no reason you have to visit during this narrow window. Temperatures often begin to rise in April or May. You may have to contend with minor irritants such as ice and snow on the trails through Acadia National Park, but the crowds are smaller during these months.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">By September, the heat and humidity of summer begin to taper off, making it one of the most enjoyable months to visit. Autumn foliage peaks between the end of September and the middle of October, enhancing the already spectacular views. Although many seasonal businesses close their doors after Columbus Day, the island does not shut down entirely. You can still find some good restaurants and a small number of lodging options throughout the winter months.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Regardless of when you decide to go, you will enjoy your visit to the island more if you book your accommodations in advance, especially if you have a particular type of lodging in mind or if you\'ll be visiting on a holiday weekend. Although it\'s possible to find last-minute lodging during the summer months, it may take several phone calls. From November to April, your challenge shifts from finding an open room to finding an open hotel, motel, or bed-and-breakfast. Call ahead.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Top Reasons to Go</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Take the circle drive through Acadia National Park.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hike—or drive—to the 1,532-foot top of Cadillac Mountain for a spectacular view.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Climb down the rocks to the edge of the ocean to shoot the most photographed lighthouse in Maine, Bass Harbor Head Light.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Hop a ride on The CAT (high-speed catamaran) from Bar Harbor to Nova Scotia, Canada.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Great Itineraries</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 3 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If you have three days on Mount Desert Island, stay in Bar Harbor. There\'s plenty of things in this popular resort town to keep you occupied on your first day—from bustling boutiques to interesting museums. On Day 2, stop at the Hulls Cove Visitor Center to pick up information about special events, then head to Acadia National Park. A drive around Park Loop Road is a great way to learn the lay of the land. Stop along the way—a lot of the scenic overlooks have informational signs you may find interesting. Finish up the Park Loop Road journey by driving to the top of Cadillac Mountain to enjoy the sunset. On Day 3, rent a bike and explore the network of carriage roads that crisscross the island. Take in the spectacular view of Jordan Pond from the observation deck of the Jordan Pond House, a restaurant known for its massive popovers with lots of strawberry jam. For the afternoon\'s entertainment, hike the South Bubble Mountain (easier) or Penobscot Mountain (more challenging). As an alternative to the above, you may want to consider a one-day excursion to Nova Scotia via The CAT, if it\'s running that day.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">If You Have 5 Days</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Follow the three-day itinerary above. On Day 4, drive to Northeast Harbor, the summer home of many of the country\'s wealthiest families. Take in the Asticou Azalea Garden and Thuya Gardens.

The crowds thin in summer as the thermostat approaches 100°F in July and then soars beyond that for about four weeks. In August, sudden, dramatic cloudbursts create rainfalls over red rock walls and dramatic skies for a part of the day.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Fall brings everybody back to the park because the weather is perfect—clear, warm days, and crisp, cool nights. October is the only autumn month that gets much rain, but even that isn\'t much, considering how little rain falls in the desert: an average of only 8 inches a year.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The park almost clears out in winter, and from December through February you can hike any of the trails in nearly perfect solitude. Though few realize it, winter can be the best time to visit this part of the country. Snow seldom falls in the valley beneath the La Sal Mountains, and when it does, Arches is a photographer\'s paradise, as snow drapes slickrock mounds and natural rock windows.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Arrive early, ideally on a weekday, and allow at least three hours to explore the nuances of Jefferson\'s life as exemplified by the architecture, inventions, and layout throughout his grand, hilltop estate. Monticello (which means \"little mountain\") is the most famous of Jefferson\'s homes, constructed from 1769 to 1809. Note the narrow staircases—hidden because he considered them unsightly and a waste of space—and his inventions, such as a seven-day clock and a two-pen contraption that allowed him to make a copy of his correspondence as he wrote it without having to show it to a copyist. On-site are re-created gardens, the plantation street where his slaves lived, and a gift shop. www.monticello.org. COST: $15. OPEN: Mar.-Oct., daily 8-5; Nov.-Feb., daily 9-4:30. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Appomattox Court House</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To many in Virginia, the Civil War has never ended, but the history books say it ended here, 25 mi east of Lynchburg, on April 9, 1865, when Confederate General Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia to General Grant, leader of pursuing Union forces. There are 27 structures in the national historical park, restored to its 1865 appearance; most can be entered. A highlight is the reconstructed McLean House, in whose parlor the articles of surrender were signed. www.nps.gov/apco/. COST: June-Aug. $4; Sept.-May $3. OPEN: Daily 8:30-5. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Natural Bridge of Virginia</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">About 20 mi south of Lexington, this impressive limestone arch (which supports Route 11) has been gradually carved out by Cedar Creek, which rushes through 215 feet below. The Monacan Native American tribe called it the Bridge of God. Surveying the structure for Lord Halifax, George Washington carved his own initials in the stone; Thomas Jefferson bought it (and more than 150 surrounding acres) from King George III. The after-dark sound-and-light show may be overkill, but viewing and walking under the bridge itself and along the wooded pathway beyond are worth the price of admission. On the property are dizzying caverns that descend 34 stories, a wax museum, a toy museum, and an 18th-century village constructed by the Monacan Indian Nation. www.naturalbridgeva.com. COST: Bridge $13, all attractions $28. OPEN: Mar.-Nov., daily 8AM-dark. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Skyline Drive</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Skyline Drive runs 105 mi, alternating between open vistas and forest-hemmed stretches and offering easily accessible wilderness. Designated as a National Historic Landmark, the two-lane highway runs from Rockfish Gap at Afton, Virginia, to Front Royal. During weekends and holidays it can seem a little too much like city driving—a 35-mph speed limit, rubber-necking leaf-lookers, narrow overlook turnouts, and the occasional black bear sighting can back traffic up uncomfortably. It\'s best to choose a weekday and allow the entire day; you may want to spend an hour or two resting on one roadside boulder. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

By the time they get to the Great Smokies, where the AT reaches its highest elevation (6,625 feet) near Clingman\'s Dome, 160 mi from the trailhead in Georgia, about one-half of the hikers will already have dropped out. Typically, only about 400 hikers per year complete the entire AT.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Fish tales</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are 30 mi of regularly stocked trout streams on the <b>Cherokee Indian Reservation</b> (tel. 828/497-5201 or 800/438-1601). To fish in tribal water, you need a tribal fishing permit, available at nearly two dozen reservation businesses. The $7 permit is valid for one day and has a creel limit of 10. A five-day permit is $28. Fishing is permitted from late March to October.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Take a Hike</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">A five-minute hike from the <b>Mingo Falls Campground</b> (Big Cove Rd., about 4 mi north of Acquoni Rd.) will reward you with a view of the 200-foot-high Mingo Falls. In the downtown area you can cross the Oconaluftee River on a footbridge to <b>Oconaluftee Islands Park &amp; Trail</b> (Off U.S. 441, across from Cherokee Elementary School) and walk a trail around the perimeter of the Island Park, which also has picnic facilities. The flat 1½-mi <b>Oconaluftee River Trail</b> begins at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park entrance sign on U.S. 441 (near the entrance to the Blue Ridge Parkway) and ends at the Mountain Farm Museum-Park Visitor Center.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wet or Dry?</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The mountains sometimes seem to have a schizophrenic attitude toward alcohol. Making moonshine was once a major industry here, and it\'s still made and sold illegally in some remote areas. At the same time, many communities refuse to authorize the legal sale of alcohol. Four counties in western North Carolina—Clay, Graham, Mitchell, and Yancey—are completely dry; no alcohol can be sold, although it\'s not illegal to drink. Others operate on a spectrum, with a range of different rules and prohibitons. For all the details, visit the Web site of the <b>North Carolina Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission</b> (www.ncabc.com).</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">The Bear Facts</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Black-bear attacks in the Great Smokies or elsewhere in the mountains are extremely rare, but they do happen occasionally. If you see a bear—there are about 1,600 black bears in the Great Smokies—don\'t approach too closely. Never feed bears or leave food out, as most human-bear conflicts result from bears becoming used to eating human food. If a bear comes toward you making loud noises or swatting the ground, it\'s likely demanding more space. Don\'t run, but back away slowly. If the bear follows, especially if it is not vocalizing or swatting, stand your ground, shout, and try to intimidate it by throwing rocks.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

If you haven\'t seen a true virgin forest, you can\'t imagine what America must have looked like in the early days of settlement. A 2-mi trail takes you through wildflower- and moss-carpeted areas of incredible beauty. The forest is named for the early-20th-century poet, killed in World War I, who is famous for the lines \"I think I shall never see / A poem lovely as a tree.\" COST: Free. </div>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Cataloochee Cove</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">One of the most memorable, and eeriest, sites in all of the Smokies is Cataloochee Cove. At one time Cataloochee was a community of more than 1,200 people, in some 200 buildings. After the land was taken over in 1934 for the national park, the community dispersed. Although many of the original buildings are now gone, about a dozen houses, cabins, and barns, two churches, and other structures have been kept up. You can visit the Palmer Methodist Chapel, a one-room schoolhouse, Beach Grove School, and the Woody and Messer homesteads. It\'s much like Cades Cove on the Tennessee side, but much less visited. On a quiet day, you can almost hear the ghosts of the former Cataloochee settlers. Elk have been reintroduced around Cataloochee, and despite some losses the population now is approaching 60. This is the first time in 150 years that the Smokies have had an elk population. You can often see them from the road in the evening and early morning. Cataloochee is the most remote part of the Smokies reachable by car, via a narrow, winding, gravel road. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

It\'s been said that high season is now October through July, though the crowds are a bit more manageable in October and after mid-April. Summers can be scorchers in this desert landscape, reaching temperatures that climb into the 90s and above. Book early—often as many as six months in advance for top holidays such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year\'s, and Easter, and at least three months in advance for other high-season stays.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Great Itineraries</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Each of these fills one day. Together they touch on some of Los Cabos\' most quintessential experiences from boating out to El Arco to visiting the blown-glass factory, and from grabbing a beer at a local brewpub to discovering Cabo\'s \"Fiesta Zone.\"</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Learn the Lay of the Land</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On Day 1 take it easy, enjoy your hotel, take a swim in the pool, and get to know the beach in your general area. If staying in Cabo, meander around town, mentally noting the many restaurants and shops on the way that you might wish to sample later. Walking the length of the Marina boardwalk will introduce you to Cabo\'s notorious party central: From the boardwalk\'s western end beginning near the <b>Marina Fiesta Hotel,</b> you\'ll pass through the marina\'s \"Fiesta Zone\" (along which is the infamous <b>Nowhere Bar</b>). If you make it all the way to the <b>Baja Cantina, No Worry\'s</b> lighthouse restaurant/bar, and finally the <b>Tesoro Hotel</b> on your right, you\'ve essentially done the marina walk. Note that it\'s here where you can catch a boat for sunset cruises, whale-watching, and sportfishing. \"M\" Dock is also home for Cabo\'s largest, costliest, and most-impressive yachts, including the top sport fishers.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Traversing the Corridor</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">To see the Corridor and make it over to San José del Cabo, it\'s most convenient and least expensive if you rent a car for a couple of days. Shop around for rentals and you\'ll be amazed at the range. Take your time driving along the Corridor, both to enjoy the sights of the coast, as well as to become accustomed to the unique traits of this quirky highway. On and off ramps are challenging, as you\'ll see. About mid-Corridor you pass <b>Santa Maria</b> and <b>Chileno Bay,</b> fun for stops to sun, swim, and snorkel. Bring your own equipment and refreshments.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As you near San José del Cabo, you can\'t miss the <b>Tiendas de Palmilla</b> (Palmilla Shopping Center) across from the <b>One&amp;Only Palmilla Resort.</b> Tiendas comprises upscale shops and two excellent restaurants, Nick San and Trinidad. Heading farther east you\'ll shortly see a turnout and large parking lot—a great panoramic overlook of the Sea of Cortez. It\'s a great spot to watch the surf at the <b>Old Man\'s</b> break, to your right, in front of the <b>Cabo Surf Hotel.</b></div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Beachy, Happy People</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For a small deposit, many hotels provide beach towels, coolers, and umbrellas, or you can rent these from <b>Trader Dicks</b> just west of La Jolla de los Cabos Resort near the Costa Azul beach. Dicks also fixes good box lunches. To get to the most-pristine beaches along the Sea of Cortez, head east out of San José del Cabo by car. At the corner of Boulevard Mijares and Calle Benito Juárez in San José, turn east at the sign marked pueblo la playa. The paved street soon becomes a dirt road that leads to the small fishing villages of <b>La Playa</b> (The Beach) and <b>La Playita</b> (The Little Beach), about 1.5 km (0.5 mi) from San José. As of this writing, construction of a marina resort complex is under way here; watch for road detours.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From La Playita, drive 60 km (37 mi) up the coast to the ecological reserve <b>Cabo Pulmo,</b> home of Baja Sur\'s largest coral reef. Water depths range from 15 to 130 feet, and colorful marine animals live among the reef and many shipwrecks. When hunger pangs call, stroll up the beach from Cabo Pulmo to <b>Tito\'s</b> for a fish taco and an ice-cold <i>cerveza.</i> Try to get back to La Playa by late afternoon to avoid driving the East Cape\'s dirt road at night. Stop for some fresh seafood and a frozen margarita at <b>Buzzard\'s Bar and Grill</b> right near the beach just north of La Playa. San José is 10 minutes away.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Taking In the Sights</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Set out for the <b>Fábrica de Vidrio Soplado</b> (Blown-Glass Factory)—a bit hard to find if you\'re driving yourself. First head toward San José on Avenida Cárdenas, which turns into Highway 1. Turn left at the stoplight and signs for the bypass to Todos Santos; then look for signs to the factory. It\'s in an industrial area two blocks northwest of Highway 1. At the factory, you can watch the talented artisans use a process little changed since it was first developed some 4,000 years ago.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the factory, head east on Highway 1 for the 20-minute drive to San José del Cabo. Park at the south end of Boulevard Mijares near the Tropicana hotel/restaurant, since traffic tends to get congested from here on in. Grab some lunch at El Azahar, an upscale Mexican restaurant with crepes as well as ceviche and chicken mole. Then stroll to the central plaza, or <i>zócalo,</i> directly in front of the <b>Iglesia San José</b> (mission church) and join the locals in this tree-shaded square.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">For dinner, the <b>Baja Brewing Company,</b> located on Avenida Morelos, has a tasty San José Especial cerveza, and offers international pub fare to go along with it.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Adventurous Explorations</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From the Cabo San Lucas marina, board one of the glass-bottom boats that depart regularly for the dramatic <b>Arco</b> (Arch) and <b>Playa del Amor</b> (Lover\'s Beach), the sandy stretch in El Arco\'s shadow. Or head out in a kayak or tour boat from Playa Médano. The boat ride is half the fun, especially if you cruise by the sea lion colony on the rocks near the arch. Swim and snorkel only on the Sea of Cortez side, though; the Pacific side is too rough. When you\'re ready to go, board the next boat back to the marina or paddle back to shore. This is a good time to settle in for a leisurely lunch on <b>Playa Médano.</b> Order a cold drink and a big plate of tacos or grilled fish at the <b>Office</b> or <b>Mango Deck.</b></div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Spend your afternoon in artsy Todos Santos. Head 45 minutes north of San Lucas along Highway 19 to this small, laid-back town. Walk down Benito Juárez to the gorgeously restored <b>Hotel California.</b> Turn left at the corner of Calle Máquez de León to see the <b>Misión Nuestra del Señora de Pilar</b> (Mission of Our Lady of Pilar). Off to the right, on Calle Centenario, is the <b>Cafe Santa Fe,</b> one of the first buildings in Todos Santos to be renovated, starting a trend that revived the area. The café has a beautiful garden and serves organic dishes. Along any street, explore interesting cafés, shops, and galleries.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

The azure cove on the Sea of Cortez at the very tip of the Land\'s End peninsula may well be the area\'s most frequently photographed patch of sand. It\'s a must-see on every first-timer\'s list. Water taxis, glass-bottom boats, kayaks, and Jet Skis all make the short trip out from Playa Médano to this small beach, backed by cliffs streaked white with pelican and seagull guano. Snorkeling around the base of these rocks is fun when the water\'s calm; you may spot striped sergeant majors and iridescent green and blue parrot fish. Seals hang out on the rocks a bit farther out, at the base of \"El Arco,\" Cabo\'s famed arched landmark. Walk along the sand to the Pacific side to see pounding white surf; just don\'t dive into these rough waters.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Swimming and snorkeling are best on the Sea of Cortez side of Lover\'s Beach, where the clear, green, almost luminescent water is unquestionably the nicest in Cabo San Lucas. The Pacific side is too turbulent for swimming but ideal for relatively secluded sunbathing. Vendors are scarce, so bring your own snacks and plenty of water. The beach is crowded at times, but never like Playa Médano. To get here, take a five-minute panga water-taxi ride or the half-hour glass-bottom boat tour. Opt for the latter if you wish to have some time to photograph the arch from the Pacific-side view. Both boats leave with relative frequency from the Cabo San Lucas marina or Playa Médano. Contact <b>Pisces Water Sports</b> (Playa Médano next to Pueblo Bonito Rosé Hotel. tel. 624/148-7530 cell phone. fax 624/143-4883) for information about the glass-bottom boat tour. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Bahía Santa María</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">This wide, sloping, horseshoe-shape beach is surrounded by cactus-covered rocky cliffs, and the placid waters are a protected fish sanctuary. The bay is part of an underwater reserve and a great place to snorkel: brightly colored fish swarm through chunks of white coral and golden sea fans. Unfortunately, this little slice of paradise offers no shade unless you sit in the shadows at the base of the cliffs, so you may want to consider bringing a beach umbrella. In high season, from November to May, there\'s usually someone renting snorkeling gear for $10 a day or selling sarongs, straw hats, and soft drinks. It\'s best to bring your own supplies, though, including lots of drinking water, snacks, and sunscreen. Snorkel and booze-cruise boats from Cabo San Lucas visit the bay in mid-morning through about 1 PM. Arrive mid-afternoon if you want to get that full Robinson Crusoe feel. The parking lot is just off the highway and is usually guarded; be sure to tip the guard. The bay is roughly 19 km (11 mi) west of San José and 13 km (8 mi) east of Cabo San Lucas. Turn off the highway\'s east side at the sign that reads accesso a zona federal. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

You might want to spend a short time in Vineyard Haven before getting rural Up-Island or heading for a beach. Or you might prefer to go straight to Edgartown to stroll past the antique white houses, pop into a museum or two, and shop. If you just want to have fun, Oak Bluffs, with its harbor scene and nearby beaches, is the place to go. In essence, pick and choose what you like best from what follows. The Vineyard is small enough that you can pick one town as your base and easily explore other areas.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Perfect Day Down Island</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Start your day in Vineyard Haven. Historic houses line William Street, and you\'ll find shops and eateries along Main Street. Take a quick jaunt out to West Chop for a great view over Vineyard Sound from the lighthouse; then head back through town toward Oak Bluffs via Beach Road. Spend some time wandering the streets of the Oak Bluffs Campground, where tightly packed pastel-painted Victorian cottages vie with one another for the fanciest gingerbread trim. Then head into the center of Oak Bluffs for a ride on the Flying Horses, the oldest continuously operating carousel in the country.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Instead of going to Oak Bluffs from Vineyard Haven, you could head straight to Edgartown, where you can spend the afternoon browsing the shops and visiting museums. Take the On-Time ferry to Chappaquiddick Island to visit the Mytoi preserve or have a picnic at Three Ponds Preserve. If conservation areas are your thing, the Cape Poge Wildlife Refuge on the island is a must. You\'ll need a few hours on Chappaquiddick to make the visit worthwhile.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Perfect Day Up Island</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Begin your day with a visit to the West Tisbury farms, some of which have pony rides for kids. A stroll amid Long Point Reservation\'s 633 acres of open grassland and heath makes for an engaging morning.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Then drive out to Aquinnah Cliffs (formerly Gay Head), one of the most spectacular spots on the island. Go to the lookout at the cliffs for the view, or take the boardwalk to the beach and walk back to see the cliffs and Aquinnah Light from below. Spend some time sunning and swimming at this breathtaking spot. (A note to the modest: the beach attracts nude sunbathers; though it\'s illegal, officials usually look the other way.)</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">On your way back from the cliffs, stop in the fishing village of Menemsha. You could also stop at the Winery at Chicama Vineyards in West Tisbury for a tasting. As the day comes to an end, pick up some seafood and take it to Menemsha Beach for a sunset picnic.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">A Perfect Rainy Day</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After you\'ve assessed that gray skies and steady downpours do not constitute beach weather, start your day curled up with a good book. If you need some good reading material, get up early and visit Edgartown Books in Edgartown or Bunch of Grapes in Vineyard Haven. Book Den East, in a converted barn in Oak Bluffs, is full of rare and fascinating used books. You can also drop by one of the six island libraries.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">By late morning, with cabin fever setting in, visit the small handful of island museums. The Martha\'s Vineyard Historical Society houses exhibits in the Captain Pease House, the Gale Huntington Library of History, and the Foster Gallery—all in Edgartown. The Vincent House Museum, also in Edgartown, contains displays of early island life. While in Edgartown, have lunch at the cozy Wharf Pub.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">After lunch, head to the video arcade in Oak Bluffs and, across the street, the Flying Horses carousel, both for kids and kids-at-heart. The whole family can unwind at the Offshore Ale brewpub, also in Oak Bluffs, where dart enthusiasts can find formidable foes.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">By late afternoon and into evening, movies can distract you from the downpour (however, island theaters rarely show matinees earlier than 4 PM). If you\'re renting a house that has a TV and a VCR or DVD, you\'re set. There are great video rental shops in the Down-Island towns. If you\'re Up-Island, try Alley\'s General Store in West Tisbury and the Harbor Craft Shop in Menemsha. Libraries also have videos for overnight loan, though, depending on the town, you may have to purchase a library card first.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">If all else fails, you can always watch the storm through your window and daydream.. of sunny days.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

A boardwalk runs through part of the grounds, where you\'re apt to see box turtles and hear the sounds of songbirds. There are few more enchanting spots on the island. The garden was created in 1958 by a private citizen. Restroom facilities are available. COST: Free.

Santa Fe is at its most festive at this time, with incense and piñon smoke sweetening the air and the darkness of winter illuminated by thousands of <i>farolitos</i>: these glowing paper-bag lanterns line walkways, doorways, rooftops, and walls. With glowing lights reflected on the snow, Santa Fe is never lovelier.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most ceremonial dances at the pueblos occur in summer, early fall, and at Christmas and Easter.

Naturally, prices are highest then as well. Although summer is quickly gaining in popularity, the real deals can be had in the mud seasons—late autumn and late spring when the ski slopes are closed. Restaurants will often offer two-for-one entrées with a bottle of wine, and hotels run deeply cut rates. Traffic through the I-70 corridor moves at a good clip unless snows have stacked up truckers putting on chains on either side of Vail Pass. The pass itself is low, and stays below tree line, affording it some protection from drifting and blowing snow.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Top Reasons to Go</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>The Slopes:</b> Despite the somewhat corny faux-Tyrolean ambience of the village, Vail has as real and challenging a ski mountain as you will find anywhere in the western United States, with the steeps and back bowls to prove it.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Romantic Meals:</b> The art of romantic dining has been perfected here. Both Vail and Beaver Creek have a number of intimate restaurants hidden away among the peaks reachable by ski, on horseback, and even by horse-drawn sleighs (van shuttles are also available).</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Rugged Scenery:</b> If you\'re expecting the alps—sheer, glacier-scraped peaks—you might be disappointed with much of Colorado\'s High Country, which tends toward rounded summits and eroded ridges. But not in the Vail Valley. The Gore Range to the north sports some of the most rugged and sharp-spined backcountry in the state with ice-cold tarns and sheer cliffs. Not surprisingly, shaggy white mountain goats are frequently seen here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Golfing:</b> The thin air at this altitude lets your Titleist fly much farther than in the denser air at sea level. And you\'ll have plenty of venues—more than a dozen—to play on, so enjoy those hero swings.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\"><b>Festivals:</b> If hiking the steeps in summer doesn\'t appeal to you, check out some of Vail\'s many cultural activities—summer is full of music and dance festivals.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

For a real taste of Hawaiian culture, plan your visit around a festival. In January, islanders and visitors compete in ancient Hawaiian games at the Ka Molokai Makahiki Festival. The Molokai Ka Hula Piko, an annual daylong event in May, draws the state\'s premiere hula troupes, musicians, and storytellers to perform. The Festival of Lights includes an Electric Light Parade down the main street of Kaunakakai in December. While never crowded, the island is busier during these events—book accommodations and transportation six months in advance.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Some places are too rocky for swimming, so look carefully before entering the water and go in only when the waves are small (generally in summer). There\'s so much sand here that Honolulu once purchased barge-loads in order to replenish Waikiki Beach. A shady beach park just inland is the site of the Ka Hula Piko Festival of Hawaiian Music and Dance, held each year in May. The park is also a great sunset-facing spot for a rustic afternoon barbecue. Camping is allowed with a permit, available from the Department of Parks, Land and Natural Resources in Kaunakakai. </div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">The most splendid stretch of golden-white sand on Molokai, Papohaku is also the island\'s largest beach—it stretches 3 mi along the western shore. Even on busier days you\'re likely to see only a handful of other people. If the waves are high, swimming is dangerous. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Molokai Mule Ride</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Mount a friendly mule and wind along a 3-mi, 26-switchback trail to reach the town of Kalaupapa, which was home to patients with leprosy. The path was built in 1886 as a supply route for the settlement below. Once in Kalaupapa, you can take a guided tour of the town (book in advance) and have a picnic lunch. The trail is very steep, down some of the highest sea cliffs in the world. Only those in good shape should attempt the ride, as two hours each way on a mule can take its toll. The entire event takes seven hours. Make reservations ahead of time, as spots are limited. The same outfit can arrange for you to hike down or fly in, or some combination of a hike in and fly out. www.muleride.com. COST: $165. OPEN: Mon.-Sat. 8-3. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGUide\">Halawa Valley</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">As far back as AD 650 a busy community lived in this valley, the oldest recorded habitation on Molokai. Hawaiians lived in a perfectly sustainable relationship with the valley\'s resources, growing taro and fishing until the 1960s, when cultural changes plus an enormous flood wiped out the taro patches and forced the old-timers to abandon their traditional lifestyle. Now a new generation of Hawaiians has returned and begun the challenging work of restoring the taro fields. Much of this work involves rerouting stream water to flow through carefully engineered level ponds called <i>loi.</i> The taro plants with their big dancing leaves grow in the submerged mud of the <i>loi,</i> where the water is always cool and flowing. Hawaiians believe that the taro plant is their ancestor and revere it both as sustenance and as a spiritual necessity. The Halawa Valley Cooperative gives tours of this restoration project and leads hikes through the valley, which is home to two sacrificial temples, many historic sites, and the 3-mi trail to Moaula Falls, a 250-foot cascade. The $75 fee ($45 for children 7-11; under 6 free with paying adult) goes to support the restoration work. www.gomolokai.com. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

Regardless of water tempeture, tour operators will often recommend that you wear at least a \"shortie\" wet suit to help keep you buoyant, a Lycra suit to protect you against unexpected stings from coral while you\'re exploring, and in some cases, a full-body stinger suit for protection against box jellyfish tentacles. The warm days, clear skies, and balmy nights of the \"dry\" season, especially winter (June-August) are ideal for traveling around and above Cairns. If you choose an island on the southern end of the chain, keep in mind that some winter days may be too cool for swimming.</div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Top Reasons To Go</h1><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Deep-Blue Views</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Sometimes just getting out to the reef is an adventure, especially if you travel by helicopter or seaplane. Once you get there, the undersea views vary greatly, but even in the shallower or murkier spots you\'ll still see creatures you\'d never otherwise encounter outside an aquarium, or a fancy fish tank. In prime viewing spots along the outer reef, and especially around Orpheus Island, the variety of coral and fish is incredible, and well worth the price you\'ll have to pay to access it.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Reef Explorations</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">There are thousands of spectacular dive sites scattered along the coral spine of the Great Barrier Reef. Some of the most famous, like Briggs Reef off Cairns, draw hundreds of divers and snorkelers a day with clouds of fish and coral formations, along with moray eels, stingrays, and the occasional white-tipped reef shark. More remote dive sites, like those in the far north of the Coral Sea, are only accessible after a weeklong journey by live-aboard dive boat.</div><h2 class=\"WorldGuide\">Wildlife Watching</h2><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Life in and around the water is why most people visit the Great Barrier Reef, but flora and fauna on the islands themselves can be fascinating. Some have rain forests, or hills and rocky areas, or postcard-perfect beaches. On Heron, Wilson, Lady Musgrave, or Lady Elliott, see green and loggerhead turtles flip-flop ashore to lay their eggs November through March. Lady Elliott and Heron islands are known worldwide for nesting seabirds, and migrating species stop in at by the thousands July to September.</div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.

One of just six island resorts actually on the Reef, it\'s a high-level Marine National Park Zone. Wildlife here easily outnumbers the guests (a maximum of 105 can visit at any one time)—and that reality is underscored by the ammoniacal odor of thousands of nesting seabirds and, in season, the sounds and sights of them courting, mating, and nesting. Ornithophobes might want to holiday elsewhere.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Divers will enjoy the easy access to the reef and the variety of diving sites around Lady Elliot. Fringed on all sides by the reef and blessed with a stunning white-sand, coral-strewn shore, this oval isle seems to have been made for diving—there\'s a busy dive shop and a reef education center complete with saltwater-fish, turtle, shell, and other marine-themed exhibits (plus an educational video library—great for rainy days). The land is often battered by waves, which can sometimes cancel dives and wash out underwater visibility. When the waters are calm, you\'ll see turtles, morays, sharks, rays, and millions of tropical fish. Many divers visit Lady Elliot specifically to encounter the large resident population of manta rays that feed off the coral.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">From October to April, Lady Elliot becomes a busy breeding ground for crested and bridled terns, silver gulls, lesser frigate birds, and the rare red-tailed tropic bird. Between November and March, green and loggerhead turtles emerge from the water to lay their eggs; hatching takes place after January. During the hatchling season, staff biologists host guided turtle-watching night hikes. From about July through October, pods of humpback whales are visible from the beachfront restaurant.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Lady Elliot is one of the few islands in the area where camping—albeit modified—is part of the resort, and a back-to-basics theme pervades the accommodations. </div>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"WorldGuide\">Heron Island</h1><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Most resort islands lie well inside the shelter of the distant reef, but Heron Island, some 70 km (43 mi) northwest of the mainland port of Gladstone, is actually part of the reef. The waters off this 41-acre island are spectacular, teeming with fish and coral, and ideal for snorkeling and scuba diving. The water is clearest in June and July and cloudiest during the rainy season, January and February.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Heron Island operates on \"island time\"—an hour ahead of Eastern Standard Time—and at its own leisurely pace. You won\'t find much in the way of nightlife, as the island\'s single accommodation accepts a cozy maximum of 250 people—and there are no day-trippers. But these might be reasons why you decide to come here.</div><div class=\"WorldGuide\">Only guests of the Heron Island Resort can visit uninhabited <b>Wilson Island</b> (tel. 1300/134044. www.voyages.com.au/Wilson), a coral cay 10 km (6 mi) north, a 40-minute day trip from Heron Island. In January and February, Wilson Island becomes the breeding ground for roseate terns and green and loggerhead turtles. The island also has its own exclusive, six-suite, luxury tented resort, catering to a maximum of 12 guests (and no children under 16), with all meals included in the rate—A$495 per person, per night in high season. Combination packages are available, allowing for two nights at Heron Island and three nights at Wilson Island, including meals. The island closes in February, however, to protect nesting birds. </div><div class=\"FodorsCopyright\">Copyright &copy; 2010 by Fodor’s Travel, a division of Random House, Inc.
